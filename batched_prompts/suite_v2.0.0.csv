    const data = new FormData();
    data.append('file', this.uploadInput.files[0]);

It's also worth noting that just about any HTML can go within the <code>.accordion-body</code>, though the transition does limit overflow.

I installed psycopg2 using conda on Windows 10.
https://anaconda.org/anaconda/psycopg2
I did it in a clean new conda environment (named wr).
I then tried to run this sample app but I am getting this error (see below). I have no idea what I might be doing wrong because it was all straightforward and I did it in a clean way.
Any ideas how to solve this?
```python
import psycopg2
try:
    connection = psycopg2.connect(user = ""***"",
                                  password = ""***"",
                                  host = ""***"",
                                  port = ""5432"",
                                  database = ""***"")


    cursor = connection.cursor()
    # Print PostgreSQL Connection properties
    print ( connection.get_dsn_parameters(),""\n"")

    # Print PostgreSQL version
    cursor.execute(""SELECT version();"")
    record = cursor.fetchone()
    print(""You are connected to - "", record,""\n"")

except (Exception, psycopg2.Error) as error :
    print (""Error while connecting to PostgreSQL"", error)
finally:
    #closing database connection.
        if(connection):
            cursor.close()
            connection.close()
            print(""PostgreSQL connection is closed"")

I'm currently working with the PyTorch framework and trying to understand foreign code. I got an indices issue and wanted to print the shape of a list.
The only way of doing so (as far as Google tells me) is to convert the list into a numpy array and then getting the shape with numpy.ndarray.shape().

But trying to convert my list into an array, I got a ValueError: only one element tensors can be converted to Python scalars.

My List is a converted PyTorch Tensor (list(pytorchTensor)) and looks somewhat like this:

Let's assume I have the number 100 which I need to divide into N parts each of which shouldn't exceed 30 initially. So the initial grouping would be (30,30,30). The remainder (which is 10) is to be distributed among these three groups by adding 2 to each group in succession, thus ensuring that each group is a multiple of 2. The desired output should therefore look like (34,34,32).

Note: The original number is always even.

I tried solving this in Python and this is what I came up with. Clearly it's not working in the way I thought it would. It distributes the remainder by adding 1 (and not 2, as desired) iteratively to each group.

```python
num = 100
parts = num//30  #Number of parts into which 'num' is to be divided

def split(a, b):
  result = ([a//b + 1] * (a%b) + [a//b] * (b - a%b))

4 Dodge      Caravan    
5 Dodge      Ram

I'm trying to upgrade a project from SpringCloud BOM `2020.0.1` to `2020.0.2`

When I change the BOM and re-build, I get an error in JUnit tests, saying that the new parameter `spring.config.import` is not set for configserver.

This project is not a ConfigServer, neither use ConfigServer (commented config client)

This is the reported error in tests `contextLoads()`

```

This is what I've tried so far:

1. I changed `.idea/compiler.xml` target values from 8 to 11 but that didn't help. Also, verified the `Target bytecode version` in `settings > Build, Execution, Deployment > Compiler > Java Compiler` and all my modules are set to 11.
2. Went to `file > Project Structure > SDKs *(currently I have 1.7 and 1.7 listed)* > Add new SDK > JDK >` After that, I selected `C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-11.0.1` But it errors out with ""The selected directory is not a valid home for JDK""

I am not sure if I installed the wrong JDK 11, because in my `C:\Program Files\Java\`, I see separate JDK and JRE folders for `1.7` and `1.8` but only JDK folder for `11.0.1`

I changed my system environment variables and set the

```
JAVA_HOME to C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-11.0.1

```

MediaSessionCompat:Targeting S+ (version 31 and above) requires that one of FLAG_IMMUTABLE or FLAG_MUTABLE be specified when creating a PendingIntent

I'm trying to update my application to Android SDK 31 but I'm having an issue with MediaSessionCompat.
I have a MediaService that extends the MediaBrowserServiceCompat() and in method onCreate of that service I initialise the MediaSessionCompat.
```
override fun onCreate() {
  super.onCreate()
  mediaSession = MediaSessionCompat(this, TAG).apply {
    setCallback(mediaSessionCallback)
    isActive = true
  }
...
```

But I'm having the following error
```
java.lang.RuntimeException: Unable to create service com.radio.core.service.MediaService: java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: com.xxx.xxx: Targeting S+ (version 31 and above) requires that one of FLAG_IMMUTABLE or FLAG_MUTABLE be specified when creating a PendingIntent.
    Strongly consider using FLAG_IMMUTABLE, only use FLAG_MUTABLE if some functionality depends on the PendingIntent being mutable, e.g. if it needs to be used with inline replies or bubbles.

I'm creating a list of values, in a context where it so happens that, though the values are being added one at a time, the eventual number is known in advance. This is in a function that will be called many times, so the faster it runs, the better.

In Java, I would use the ArrayList constructor that specifies an initial capacity, because in theory this makes it slightly faster because it avoids resizing.

In Kotlin, one normally uses mutableListOf(), but this does not allow an initial capacity; in theory this should result in slightly slower code.

Is the recommended/idiomatic Kotlin solution in this case:


1. Go ahead and use the ArrayList constructor; ArrayList is a perfectly valid MutableList.
2. Ignore the issue; the initial capacity never actually makes a measurable difference to speed.
3. Something else?

Should it not be something simple like clipboard.SetText textValue?

I tried following the hint by BrianMStafford but don't succeed. Perhaps the reason is that my object is a node in a tree.
When I do MsgBox Me.NodeKey.Value
it all works fine - I see the node path in the message box.

I have an ms access vba code from which i wish to copy some text value to the Windows clipboard so that I can paste it elsewhere (Word/Excel/Notepad/etc).
I have been searching for this in SO but everything seems over-complicated.
Should it not be something simple like clipboard.SetText textValue?

I tried following the hint by BrianMStafford but don't succeed. Perhaps the reason is that my object is a node in a tree.
When I do MsgBox Me.NodeKey.Value
it all works fine - I see the node path in the message box.
But when I do
Me.NodeKey.SetFocus
DoCmd.RunCommand acCmdCopy
I don't get the node path in the clipboard.
So how can I copy the node path value into the Windows clipboard?

I have created a VBA code to remove all special characters available in a column. As an example I have a Alphanumeric character with some special characters in every cells of a column:
Suppose in a cell I have a value: abc@123!-245
After executing my code I got output abc 123 245
Here my code is working fine to remove all the special characters. My code is given below:
```
vba
Sub ReplaceSpecial()
    Dim cel As Range
    Dim strVal As String
    Dim i As Long
    Application.ScreenUpdating = False
    For Each cel In Selection
        strVal = cel.Value
        For i = 1 To Len(strVal)
            Select Case Asc(Mid(strVal, i, 1))
                Case 32, 48 To 57, 65 To 90, 97 To 122
                    ' Leave ordinary characters alone
                Case Else
                    Mid(strVal, i, 1) = "" ""
            End Select
        Next i
        cel.Value = strVal
    Next cel
    Application.ScreenUpdating = True
End Sub
```

Now if I want to remove the space for my output so that output should look like abc123245, how to do that in VBA?
Input: abc@123!-245
Current Output: abc 123 245
Required Output: abc123245

There is a more efficient method using the  and  methods to obtain the points that can be used with SelectByID2 method. The issue of the method below is that creation of each point is not time efficient nor tidy in the feature tree. Will update this thread once I have time.
Thank you for understanding.

I recently started some programming in VBA in SolidWorks and I am looking to write a macro. The goal for now is to create a reference plane from selected face and point(deriving it from edge). As a reminder, method to create the reference plane is InsertRefPlane, which requires the selection to be done by SelectByID2 method.
So far I've managed to save the handle for the face and point objects, but I haven't managed to successfully use the SelectByID2 method. Objects that were selected become deselected.
`value = instance.SelectByID2(Name, Type, X, Y, Z, Append, Mark, Callout, SelectOption)`
I have tried select just a face, but I couldn't manage to do it. Also, I have renamed the face property using the SetEntityName method, and supplied it as well, but it did not manage to select it.
Could you please share the ideas how to do create a reference plane? It doesn't have to be necessary a face and an edge/mid-point.
Thank you in advance.

For further clarification, I have added two objects (face and edge) to selection and I would like to use those to properly select objects with SelectByID2 to use for InsertRefPlane. I have added the code below.
Ideas that I have are:
- I have handles to the face and the edge, but can I use those for proper selection with SelectByID2?- Can I create a reference points on the selected face and edge to identify the face somehow?- SelectByRay seems feasible, but it would require some calculations with face normals so, I would try some other ""simpler"" methods if available. : I have non-planar face so I can't request Normal property of the face.- : It seems that it all comes down to identifying an object name and type is the way to solve the problem. This is probably a solution, but I'm open for another one, easier if possible. We can create a reference points when using one of appropriate Selection methods, because their names are known, we can use those for SelectbyID2 method.  Will post the solution once I am done.- Regarding the GetFaces/GetFirstFace/GetNextFace methods, [InsertRefPlane](https://help.solidworks.com/2017/english/api/sldworksapi/solidworks.interop.sldworks%7Esolidworks.interop.sldworks.ifeaturemanager%7Einsertrefplane.html) requires objects to be selected by SelectByID2

I have a spreadsheet that many people need to access (on sharepoint), for a few reasons, we need to do this locally (synced).
however, there are constantly problems and errors arising due to knowledge levels of each user, the spreadsheet needs to have structure and consistency,  so in order to achieve that, i have created a userform with a suite of parameters to help people enter accurate data and avoid errors.
it is a tender register, used to enter client, client contact and tender information, which generates a quote number, folder and file name etc.
prior to OneDrive/Sharepoint path change (previously the file path would be local, now it is a sharepoint URL)
i had a macro that would run when a user clicked a button, that would create an appropriately named folder in the relevant local sharepoint directory, create a standard set of folders within that folder (Client Documents, Contract, Product Files, Drawings etc.) then open a Tender Form and save it in the created folder. the filename (the quote number) was used to lookup a query from the Tender register to return all the client/contact/quote information.
since sharepoint has changed it's path protocol from local to URL, i can't get this to work, resulting in a manual process, therefore, resulting in errors and inconsitencies.
i have searched high and low for ways to create folders and files on sharepoint using VBA, and also for ways to interact with the local path other than disabling ""Use Office applications to sync Office files that I Open"" (this function is required due to file collaboration.)
I had one hope when i found a way to convert a URL to a Local path, however, this isn't the best solution as each user syncs folders at different levels (maybe there is a way someone could help me with determining the path, a macro to search in the OneDrive directory for folder ""2021 Tenders"" and return the path... think this might be slow though)
however, i noticed if i goto File > Info, there is a button for ""Open File Location"" which takes me directly to the local path folder of the file, which tells me this information is somewhere in excel, there must be a way to retrieve it, i haven't seen reference to this in any of my searches, upon pointing it out, does anyone have any ideas on how or if this could work?
i tried to record a macro, but it didn't register it at all.
any help would be appreciated and thank you in advance.

I am attempting to utilize the AWS CLI along with a `for` loop in bash to iteratively purge multiple SQS message queues.  The bash script works almost as intended, the problem I am having is with the return value each time the AWS CLI sends a request.  When the request is successful, it returns an empty value and opens up an interactive pager in the command line.  I then have to manually type `q` to exit the interactive screen and allow the `for` loop to continue to the next iteration.  This becomes very tedious and time consuming when attempting to purge a large number of queues.
Is there a way to configure AWS CLI to disable this interactive pager from popping up for every return value?  Or a way to pipe the return values into a separate file instead of being displayed?
I have played around with configuring different return value types (text, yaml, JSON) but haven't had any luck.  Also the `--no-pagination` parameter doesn't change the behavior.

```

Steps 7 and 15 are supposed to show me the results, but this is just omitted. (I know, its the cached result, but it didn't show up, when  I changed the Dockerfile and rebuild the layer as well).
setting `--progress=plain`  didn't do any good. In fact it just changed the color from purple to white (HideThePainHarold.jpg).
Any help will be greatly appreciated.

OSX Docker Build: How can I see the full build output? (--progress=plain not the solution!)

I just got a MacBook from work and I am using it to build docker images. Usually, the docker build shows the full log (i.e. `ls -la` showing the cwd). Thats at least what I'm used to from my linux machine.
On the macbook however, it only shows a brief overview: (actual console output)

Steps 7 and 15 are supposed to show me the results, but this is just omitted. (I know, its the cached result, but it didn't show up, when  I changed the Dockerfile and rebuild the layer as well).
setting `--progress=plain`  didn't do any good. In fact it just changed the color from purple to white (HideThePainHarold.jpg).
Any help will be greatly appreciated.
