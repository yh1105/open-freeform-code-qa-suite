Angular CLI doesn't provide a specific command to remove a package. However, you can remove a package manually by following these steps:

1. Open your `package.json` file.
2. Find the package you want to remove in the `dependencies` or `devDependencies` section.
3. Delete the line that contains the package.
4. Save the `package.json` file.
5. Run `npm install` in your terminal. This will update your `node_modules` folder and `package-lock.json` file based on the changes you made in the `package.json` file.

Alternatively, you can use npm or yarn to remove the package:

- If you're using npm, run `npm uninstall <package-name>`.
- If you're using yarn, run `yarn remove <package-name>`.

These commands will remove the package from `node_modules`, `package.json`, and `package-lock.json` or `yarn.lock`.
