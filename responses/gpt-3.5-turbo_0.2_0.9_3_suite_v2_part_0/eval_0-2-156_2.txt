To move the Stop button to the top and align it properly with the Begin button, you can add the following CSS code to your `style.css` file:

```css
#GameStopped {
  position: relative;
}

#StopBtn {
  position: absolute;
  top: 0;
  right: 0;
}
```

This will make the `#GameStopped` div position relative, which will allow the `#StopBtn` to be positioned absolutely within it. The `top: 0` and `right: 0` properties will move the button to the top right corner of the `#GameStopped` div. You can adjust the `top` and `right` values to fine-tune the button's position.
