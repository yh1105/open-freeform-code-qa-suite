You can use the Tailwind CSS utility classes to apply border to only the top edge. The class `border-t` applies the border to the top edge and `border-0` removes the border from all edges. 

Here is how you can do it:

```html
<div class="border-0 border-t border-blue-900">foo</div>
```

In this code, `border-0` removes the border from all sides, then `border-t` applies the border to the top edge, and `border-blue-900` sets the color of the border.
