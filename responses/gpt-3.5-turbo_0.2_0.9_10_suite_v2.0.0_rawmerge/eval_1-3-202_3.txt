It seems like there is an issue with removing the 'requests' and 'setuptools' packages from the conda environment. One possible solution is to create a new environment and install the required packages in that environment. You can try the following steps:

1. Create a new environment using the following command:

```bash
conda create --name myenv python=3.6
```

2. Activate the new environment using the following command:

```bash
conda activate myenv
```

3. Install the required packages in the new environment using the following command:

```bash
conda install requests setuptools
```

4. Finally, install the third party library in the new environment using the following command:

```bash
pip install <library-name>
```

Replace `<library-name>` with the name of the third party library you are trying to install.

This should create a new environment with the required packages and allow you to install the third party library without any issues.
