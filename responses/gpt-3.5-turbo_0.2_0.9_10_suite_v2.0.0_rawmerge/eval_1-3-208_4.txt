The issue with your code is that you are checking if the entire input string is in the `correct` string, which is not what you want. Instead, you should check if all characters in the input string are in the `correct` string. Here's the corrected code:

```python
import string

def checkString(text):
    correct = string.ascii_letters + string.digits
    for char in text:
        if char not in correct:
            return False
    return True
```

This function loops through each character in the input string and checks if it is in the `correct` string. If any character is not in the `correct` string, the function returns `False`. If all characters are in the `correct` string, the function returns `True`.

You can call this function with your input string like this:

```python
text = input("Enter: ")
if checkString(text):
    print("Success")
else:
    print("Failure")
``` 

This will print "Success" if the input string contains only "a-z", "A-Z", and "0-9", and "Failure" otherwise.
