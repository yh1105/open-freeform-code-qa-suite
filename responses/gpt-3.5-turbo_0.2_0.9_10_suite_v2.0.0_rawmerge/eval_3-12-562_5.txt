You can use the `add` and `subtract` methods of the `DateTime` class in Dart to add or subtract months or years to a date. 

To add or subtract months, you can use the `add` method with a `Duration` object that represents the number of months. For example, to add 3 months to a `DateTime` object `date`, you can use the following code:

```
DateTime newDate = date.add(Duration(days: 3 * 30));
```

To subtract 2 years from a `DateTime` object `date`, you can use the `subtract` method with a `Duration` object that represents the number of years. For example:

```
DateTime newDate = date.subtract(Duration(days: 2 * 365));
```

Also, you can use the `DateTime` constructor to define the base time and change the day/month/year properties. For example, to create a `DateTime` object that represents 2 years and 3 months from now, you can use the following code:

```
DateTime newDate = DateTime.now().add(Duration(days: 3 * 30, years: 2));
```
