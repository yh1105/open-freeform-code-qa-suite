The error message suggests that you cannot set the body fields of a request with content-type "application/json". This means that you need to encode the body data to JSON before sending it in the request.

To fix the issue, you can encode the body data to JSON using the `jsonEncode` function from the `dart:convert` library. Here's the updated code:

```dart
import 'dart:convert';

Map<String,String> headers = {'Content-Type':'application/json','authorization':'Basic c3R1ZHlkb3RlOnN0dWR5ZG90ZTEyMw=='};

var response = await post(Urls.getToken,
        headers: headers,
        body: jsonEncode({"grant_type":"password","username":"******","password":"*****","scope":"offline_access"}),
      );
```

By using `jsonEncode`, the body data is now encoded to JSON before being sent in the request. This should resolve the error you were seeing.
