To transfer native SOL directly into the event account's vault address in an anchor smart contract instruction, you can use the following code:

```
let ix = anchor_lang::solana_program::system_instruction::transfer(
    from_wallet_address,
    event_account_vault_address,
    amount,
);
anchor_lang::solana_program::program::invoke(
    &ix,
    &[
        from_wallet_address,
        event_account_vault_address,
    ],
);
```

Replace `from_wallet_address` with the wallet address of the user who is depositing SOL into the event account, and replace `event_account_vault_address` with the vault address of the event account. `amount` should be the amount of SOL being transferred.
