To remove a package installed using `ng add`, you can use the following command:

```
ng remove <package-name>
```

For example, if you want to remove the `@angular/material` package, you can run:

```
ng remove @angular/material
```

This command will remove the package and also undo any changes made to your project by the `ng add` command.
