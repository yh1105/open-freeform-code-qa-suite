This error message indicates that the file system is mounted as read-only, which means you cannot create new directories or modify existing ones. 

To resolve this issue, you can try the following steps:

1. Check the file system status by running the following command:

   ```
   mount | grep ' / '
   ```

   This will display the mount options for the root file system. Look for the "read-only" option in the output.

2. Remount the file system as read-write by running the following command:

   ```
   sudo mount -uw /
   ```

   This will remount the root file system as read-write.

3. Create the directory by running the following command:

   ```
   sudo mkdir -p /data/db
   ```

   This will create the directory `/data/db` with the necessary permissions.

After completing these steps, you should be able to create the directory without any issues.
