The error message "Failed to clear cache. Make sure you have the appropriate permissions." indicates that the user running the command does not have the necessary permissions to clear the cache. 

You can try running the command with elevated privileges by using `sudo`:

```
sudo php artisan cache:clear
```

This should allow you to clear the cache successfully. However, it's important to note that using `sudo` can be risky, so make sure you understand the implications before using it.
