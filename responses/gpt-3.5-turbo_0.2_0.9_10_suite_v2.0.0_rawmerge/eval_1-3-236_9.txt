If the `"python.linting.jediEnabled": false` line is greyed out, it means that it is being overridden by another setting. To find out which setting is overriding it, you can try the following steps:

1. Open the Command Palette by pressing `Ctrl+Shift+P` (Windows, Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+P` (macOS).
2. Type "Preferences: Open User Settings" and select it.
3. In the search bar at the top, type "jediEnabled".
4. Look for any settings that have "jediEnabled" set to "true" and try setting them to "false".

If you still can't find the setting that is overriding `"python.linting.jediEnabled": false`, you can try the following steps:

1. Open the Command Palette.
2. Type "Preferences: Open Workspace Settings" and select it.
3. In the search bar at the top, type "jediEnabled".
4. Look for any settings that have "jediEnabled" set to "true" and try setting them to "false".

If you don't have a workspace open, you can try opening a folder in VS Code and then following the above steps. If none of these steps work, you can try disabling the Jedi extension by going to the Extensions view (Ctrl+Shift+X) and searching for "Jedi" and then disabling it.
