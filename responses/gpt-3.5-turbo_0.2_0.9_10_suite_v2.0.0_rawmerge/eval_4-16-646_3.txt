This error occurs because pdftk is a 32-bit application and macOS Catalina only supports 64-bit applications. One solution is to install a 64-bit version of pdftk. Here are the steps to install pdftk using Homebrew:

1. Install Homebrew by running this command in the terminal:
```
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)"
```

2. Install pdftk by running this command in the terminal:
```
brew install pdftk-java
```

3. Once the installation is complete, you can use pdftk by running this command in the terminal:
```
pdftk input.pdf output output.pdf
```

This should solve the "pdftk: Bad CPU type in executable" error on your Mac.
