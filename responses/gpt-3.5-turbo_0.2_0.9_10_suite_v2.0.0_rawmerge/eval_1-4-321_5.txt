You can use the `tstrsplit()` function from the `data.table` package to split the `segment_stemming` column by the comma and then again by the parentheses. Here's the code for the `mySplit()` function:

```r
mySplit <- function(x) {
  x[, lapply(tstrsplit(segment_stemming, ", "), function(y) tstrsplit(gsub("[\\[\\]()']", "", y), ", ")), by = id][, -1]
}
```

Here's how the function works:

1. `tstrsplit(segment_stemming, ", ")` splits the `segment_stemming` column by comma and returns a list of character vectors.
2. `lapply()` applies a function to each element of the list. The function `tstrsplit(gsub("[\\[\\]()']", "", y), ", ")` removes the square brackets, parentheses, and single quotes from each element of the list and then splits it by comma. This returns a list of character vectors.
3. The `by = id` argument groups the resulting table by the `id` column.
4. `[, -1]` removes the first column, which is the `id` column that we grouped by.

Here's how you can use the function:

```r
mySplit(x)
#    id                 V1        V2
# 1:  A ('Brownie', 'Noun') ('From', 'Josa')
# 2:  A       ('Pi', 'Noun')         NA
# 3:  B ('Dung-caroon-gye', 'Noun') ('in', 'Josa')
# 4:  B    ('innovation', 'Noun')         NA
```

Note that the function returns a table with three columns, where the first column is the `id` and the second and third columns are the split values. You can further process the table to get the desired output format.
