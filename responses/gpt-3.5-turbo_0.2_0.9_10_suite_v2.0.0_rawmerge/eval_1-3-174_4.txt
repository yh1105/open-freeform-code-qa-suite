This error can occur when there is a mismatch between the version of psycopg2 and the version of PostgreSQL that you are using. 

You can try the following steps to solve the issue:

1. Check the version of PostgreSQL that you are using and make sure it is compatible with the version of psycopg2 that you have installed. You can check the compatibility matrix on the psycopg2 website.

2. Try uninstalling and reinstalling psycopg2 using pip instead of conda. Open a new terminal and activate the `wr` environment, then run the following command:
   ```
   pip uninstall psycopg2
   pip install psycopg2-binary
   ```

3. If the above steps do not work, you can try installing the PostgreSQL client library separately. Download the appropriate version for your system from the PostgreSQL website and install it. Then, reinstall psycopg2 using pip.

4. If none of the above steps work, you can try using a different version of psycopg2. You can check the available versions on the psycopg2 website and install a different version using pip.
