To write a list of lists into an Excel file, we can use the `openpyxl` library. Here's the implementation of the `writeExcel()` function:

```python
import openpyxl

def writeExcel():
    new_list = [["first", "second"], ["third", "fourth"]]
    wb = openpyxl.Workbook()
    sheet = wb.active
    for row in new_list:
        sheet.append(row)
    wb.save("data.xlsx")
```

In this function, we first create a new workbook using the `openpyxl.Workbook()` method. We then get the active worksheet using the `active` attribute of the workbook. We iterate over the list of lists and append each row to the worksheet using the `append()` method. Finally, we save the workbook to a file named "data.xlsx" using the `save()` method.
