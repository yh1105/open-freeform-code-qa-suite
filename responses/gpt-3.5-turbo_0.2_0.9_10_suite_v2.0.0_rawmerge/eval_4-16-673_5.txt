You can try the following steps to install the latest version of cmake on your Linux environment:

1. Remove the existing cmake version by running the following command:

   ```
   sudo apt-get remove cmake
   ```

2. Add the Kitware APT repository to your system by running the following commands:

   ```
   wget -O - https://apt.kitware.com/keys/kitware-archive-latest.asc 2>/dev/null | sudo apt-key add -
   sudo apt-add-repository 'deb https://apt.kitware.com/ubuntu/ focal main'
   ```

   Note: Replace "focal" with your Ubuntu version name (e.g. bionic, xenial, etc.) if you are not using Ubuntu 20.04 (focal).

3. Update the package list by running the following command:

   ```
   sudo apt-get update
   ```

4. Install the latest version of cmake by running the following command:

   ```
   sudo apt-get install cmake
   ```

   This should install the latest version of cmake available in the Kitware APT repository.

5. Verify the installation by running the following command:

   ```
   cmake --version
   ```

   This should display the version number of the newly installed cmake version.
