Yes, you can use the `Get-WmiObject` cmdlet to retrieve the detailed description of a Windows Service. Here's an example:

```
Get-WmiObject -Class Win32_Service | Select-Object Name, DisplayName, Description | Out-GridView
```

This will display a grid view with the Name, DisplayName, and Description of all Windows Services. You can also filter the results by specifying the name of a specific service, like this:

```
Get-WmiObject -Class Win32_Service -Filter "Name='wuauserv'" | Select-Object Name, DisplayName, Description
```

This will display the Name, DisplayName, and Description of the Windows Update service (`wuauserv`).
