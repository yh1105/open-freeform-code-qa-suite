Sure! Here's the revised route pattern that should fulfill your requirements:

```
/route/:param1/config/:OptionalParam2?/:OptionalParam3?
```

This pattern will match all three of the URLs you provided:

- `/route/aa/config`
- `/route/aa/config/bb`
- `/route/aa/config/bb/cc`

The `:param1` parameter is required, while `:OptionalParam2` and `:OptionalParam3` are both optional. The `?` character at the end of each optional parameter indicates that it may or may not be present in the URL.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
