You can try using the `--no-cache` flag when running the `docker build` command. This will force Docker to rebuild all the layers, including the ones that were previously cached. This should give you the full build output, including the results of the `ls -la` commands in steps 7 and 15.

Alternatively, you can try running the `docker build` command with the `-t` flag and a new tag name. This will create a new image with a different tag, even if the Dockerfile and build context are the same. This should also force Docker to rebuild all the layers and give you the full build output.

Finally, you can try running the `docker build` command with the `--progress=plain` flag and redirecting the output to a file. This will give you a plain text output of the build, which you can then inspect at your leisure. For example:

```
docker build --progress=plain -t myimage . > build.log
```

This will create a new image with the tag `myimage`, using the Dockerfile in the current directory (`.`), and redirect the build output to a file called `build.log`. You can then open this file in a text editor or viewer to inspect the full build output.
