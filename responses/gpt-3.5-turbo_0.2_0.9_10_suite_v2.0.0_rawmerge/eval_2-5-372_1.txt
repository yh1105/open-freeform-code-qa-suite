It seems that there might be a version conflict between the Hibernate Validator version that is included in your Spring Boot parent pom and the one that is resolved by Maven. 

You can try to exclude the Hibernate Validator dependency from your Spring Boot parent pom and add a specific version of Hibernate Validator to your dependencies. 

Here's an example of how to do it:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-validation</artifactId>
    <exclusions>
        <exclusion>
            <groupId>org.hibernate.validator</groupId>
            <artifactId>hibernate-validator</artifactId>
        </exclusion>
    </exclusions>
</dependency>

<dependency>
    <groupId>org.hibernate.validator</groupId>
    <artifactId>hibernate-validator</artifactId>
    <version>6.0.11.Final</version>
</dependency>
```

This will exclude the Hibernate Validator dependency from the Spring Boot starter validation and add a specific version of Hibernate Validator to your dependencies. 

Make sure to update the version number to the latest version available if needed.
