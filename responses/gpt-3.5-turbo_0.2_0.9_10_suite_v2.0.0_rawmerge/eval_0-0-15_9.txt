To mock a class with Jest, you can use the `jest.mock` function and return a constructor function that creates an instance of the class. Here's how you can modify your code to mock the `API` class:

```javascript
import API from 'utils/API';

jest.mock('utils/API', () => {
  return jest.fn().mockImplementation(() => {
    return {
      someMethod: jest.fn()
    };
  });
});

// Now you can create an instance of the mocked API class
const api = new API();
```

In the mock function, we return a Jest mock function that creates an instance of an object with a `someMethod` function. This should eliminate the `TypeError` you were seeing.
