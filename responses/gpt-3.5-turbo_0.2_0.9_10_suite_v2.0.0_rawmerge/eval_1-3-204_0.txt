The issue with your code is that `rename()` method is used to rename the index or column labels of a DataFrame, not the values in a column. To rename a column in a Pandas DataFrame, you can simply assign a new name to the column using the `rename()` method with the `columns` parameter. Here's the corrected code:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

def renameDataFrame(df):
    datain = np.loadtxt(datafile)
    df = pd.DataFrame(data = datain, columns = ["t","p","x","y","z"])
    avg = df.groupby(["t"], sort=False)["p"].mean().rename("mean")
    df = df.rename(columns={"p": "mean"})
    return df
```

In this code, we first group the DataFrame by "t" column and calculate the mean of "p" column. Then, we rename the "p" column to "mean" using the `rename()` method with the `columns` parameter. Finally, we return the modified DataFrame.
