The issue you are facing could be due to the compatibility of the Selenium WebDriver with Excel 2019. Here are a few things you can try to resolve the issue:

1. Make sure that you have the latest version of the Selenium WebDriver installed. You can download the latest version from the official Selenium website.

2. Check if the Selenium WebDriver reference is properly set in your Excel VBA project. To do this, go to the VBA editor and click on Tools > References. Make sure that the Selenium Type Library is checked.

3. Try using a different browser driver. For example, if you were using the Internet Explorer driver, try using the Chrome driver instead. You can download the Chrome driver from the official Selenium website.

4. Try running the code in compatibility mode. To do this, right-click on the Excel shortcut and select Properties. In the Compatibility tab, select the option to run the program in compatibility mode for an earlier version of Windows, such as Windows 7.

5. If none of the above solutions work, try uninstalling and reinstalling Excel 2019 and the Selenium WebDriver. Make sure to restart your computer after uninstalling and before reinstalling.

I hope one of these solutions helps you resolve the issue.
