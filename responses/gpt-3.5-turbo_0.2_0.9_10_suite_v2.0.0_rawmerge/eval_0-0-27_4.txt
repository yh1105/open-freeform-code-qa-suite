It seems like you are trying to fetch data from a GraphQL API endpoint that is not working properly. The `uri` you are using in your `ApolloClient` configuration is not responding with the expected data.

You can try changing the `uri` to a different GraphQL API endpoint that is working properly. For example, you can use the following `uri`:

```
https://graphql-pokemon2.vercel.app/
```

This is a public GraphQL API endpoint that returns data about Pokemon. You can update your `ApolloClient` configuration as follows:

```javascript
const apolloClient = new ApolloClient({
    uri: 'https://graphql-pokemon2.vercel.app/',
    cache: new InMemoryCache(),
});
```

Then, you can update your `EXCHANGE_RATES` query to a query that works with this API endpoint. For example, you can use the following query to get information about a specific Pokemon:

```javascript
const POKEMON_QUERY = gql`
    query GetPokemon($name: String!) {
        pokemon(name: $name) {
            id
            name
            image
            types
        }
    }
`;

const TestScreen = () => {
    const { loading, error, data } = useQuery(POKEMON_QUERY, {
        variables: { name: 'pikachu' },
    });

    console.log(loading, error, data);

    if (loading) return <Text>Loading...</Text>;
    if (error) return <Text>Error :(</Text>;

    const { id, name, image, types } = data.pokemon;

    return (
        <View>
            <Text>{name}</Text>
            <Image source={{ uri: image }} style={{ width: 100, height: 100 }} />
            <Text>Types: {types.join(', ')}</Text>
        </View>
    );
};
```

This query fetches data about a Pokemon with the name "pikachu". You can update the `variables` object to fetch data about a different Pokemon.

I hope this helps!
