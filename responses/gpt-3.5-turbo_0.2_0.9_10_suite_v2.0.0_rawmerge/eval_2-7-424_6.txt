The error message "Failed to clear cache. Make sure you have the appropriate permissions." indicates that the user running the command does not have the necessary permissions to clear the cache. This could be due to a number of reasons, such as file ownership or permissions issues. 

To fix this, you can try running the command with elevated privileges using `sudo`:

```
sudo php artisan cache:clear
```

Alternatively, you can try changing the ownership of the cache directory to the user running the command:

```
sudo chown -R yourusername:yourusername storage/
```

Replace "yourusername" with your actual username. This will change the ownership of the "storage" directory and its contents to your user, allowing you to clear the cache without elevated privileges.
