The error message suggests that you cannot set the body fields of a request with content-type "application/json". This is because the body parameter expects a string, but you are passing a Map object.

To fix this, you need to convert the Map object to a JSON string using the `jsonEncode` function from the `dart:convert` library. Here's how you can modify your code:

```dart
import 'dart:convert';

Map<String,String> headers = {'Content-Type':'application/json','authorization':'Basic c3R1ZHlkb3RlOnN0dWR5ZG90ZTEyMw=='};

var response = await post(Urls.getToken,
        headers: headers,
        body: jsonEncode({"grant_type":"password","username":"******","password":"*****","scope":"offline_access"}),
      );
```

By using `jsonEncode`, the Map object is converted to a JSON string that can be passed as the body parameter.
