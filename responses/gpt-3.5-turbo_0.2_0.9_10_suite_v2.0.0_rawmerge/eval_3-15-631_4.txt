To remove the spaces from the output, you can modify the code by adding an additional step to remove the spaces. Here is the modified code:

```
Sub ReplaceSpecial()
    Dim cel As Range
    Dim strVal As String
    Dim i As Long
    Application.ScreenUpdating = False
    For Each cel In Selection
        strVal = cel.Value
        For i = 1 To Len(strVal)
            Select Case Asc(Mid(strVal, i, 1))
                Case 32, 48 To 57, 65 To 90, 97 To 122
                    ' Leave ordinary characters alone
                Case Else
                    Mid(strVal, i, 1) = " "
            End Select
        Next i
        ' Remove spaces from the string
        strVal = Replace(strVal, " ", "")
        cel.Value = strVal
    Next cel
    Application.ScreenUpdating = True
End Sub
```

In this modified code, after removing the special characters, the `Replace` function is used to remove the spaces from the string. The resulting string is then assigned back to the cell value.
