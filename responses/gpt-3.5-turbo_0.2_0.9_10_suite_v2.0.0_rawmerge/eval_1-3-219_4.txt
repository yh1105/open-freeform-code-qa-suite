Here are a few things you can try to solve this issue:

1. Make sure that the Jupyter package is installed in your virtual environment. You can do this by activating your virtual environment and running the following command:

   ```
   conda install jupyter
   ```

2. Check if the Jupyter kernel is installed in your virtual environment. You can do this by running the following command:

   ```
   jupyter kernelspec list
   ```

   If the kernel is not listed, you can install it by running the following command:

   ```
   python -m ipykernel install --user --name=da38
   ```

3. Check if the Jupyter notebook is running in the background. You can do this by opening the command palette in VS Code (press `Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P` on Mac) and typing "Jupyter: Show Notebook List". If the notebook is not running, you can start it by selecting "Jupyter: Start Notebook Server" from the command palette.

4. Check if the Jupyter notebook is using the correct Python interpreter. You can do this by opening the command palette in VS Code and typing "Python: Select Interpreter". Make sure that the correct interpreter is selected for your virtual environment.

5. If none of the above solutions work, try resetting your VS Code settings to default. You can do this by opening the command palette and typing "Preferences: Open User Settings (JSON)". Then, delete all the contents of the file and save it. Restart VS Code and try again.

Hopefully, one of these solutions will solve your problem.
