To read a CSV file from Google Drive, you need to modify the URL in a specific way. Here's how you can modify the URL to get the CSV file:

1. Replace "file/d/" with "uc?id="
2. Remove everything after the ID of the file (which is a long string of letters and numbers)
3. Add "&export=download" at the end of the URL

Here's the modified URL for your example:

```
https://drive.google.com/uc?id=0B6GhBwm5vaB2ekdlZW5WZnppb28&export=download
```

You can use this modified URL to read the CSV file in pandas:

```python
import pandas as pd

url = 'https://drive.google.com/uc?id=0B6GhBwm5vaB2ekdlZW5WZnppb28&export=download'
df = pd.read_csv(url)
```

And here's the `processURL` function that takes the original Google Drive URL and returns the modified URL:

```python
def processURL(url):
    file_id = url.split('/')[-2]
    modified_url = f"https://drive.google.com/uc?id={file_id}&export=download"
    return modified_url
``` 

You can use this function to get the modified URL for any Google Drive CSV file.
