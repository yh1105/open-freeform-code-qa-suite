The error message you are receiving indicates that the username and password you are using to authenticate with Gmail are not being accepted. Here are a few things you can try to fix this issue:

1. Make sure that you have enabled "Less secure app access" in your Gmail account settings. To do this, go to your Google Account settings, click on "Security" in the left-hand menu, and then scroll down to "Less secure app access". Turn this setting on if it is not already.

2. Double-check that you are using the correct username and password for your Gmail account. Make sure that there are no typos or other errors in your code.

3. If you have two-factor authentication enabled for your Gmail account, you will need to generate an app password to use with nodemailer. To do this, go to your Google Account settings, click on "Security" in the left-hand menu, and then scroll down to "App passwords". Generate a new app password and use this in your nodemailer code instead of your regular Gmail password.

4. If none of the above solutions work, you may need to enable "DisplayUnlockCaptcha" in your Google account settings. This will allow you to log in to your Gmail account from a new device or application. To do this, go to your Google Account settings, click on "Security" in the left-hand menu, and then scroll down to "Less secure app access". Click on "Unlock Captcha" and follow the instructions to enable this feature.

I hope this helps you resolve the issue!
