Yes, in Flutter you can use the `VerticalDivider` widget to draw a vertical line between components. 

Here's an example:

```
Row(
  children: <Widget>[
    Expanded(
      child: Container(
        height: 100,
        color: Colors.blue,
      ),
    ),
    VerticalDivider(
      color: Colors.grey,
      thickness: 1,
    ),
    Expanded(
      child: Container(
        height: 100,
        color: Colors.green,
      ),
    ),
  ],
)
```

This code will create a `Row` with two `Container` widgets separated by a vertical line created by the `VerticalDivider` widget. You can customize the color and thickness of the line by setting the `color` and `thickness` properties of the `VerticalDivider` widget.
