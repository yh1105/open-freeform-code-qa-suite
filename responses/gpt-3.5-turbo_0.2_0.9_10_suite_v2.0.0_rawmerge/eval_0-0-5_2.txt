The error message indicates that Python is not installed on your system or it is not added to the PATH environment variable. 

To fix this issue, you need to install Python and add it to the PATH environment variable. Here are the steps to follow:

1. Download and install Python from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

2. During the installation process, make sure to select the option to add Python to the PATH environment variable.

3. After the installation is complete, open a new command prompt and run the following command to verify that Python is installed and added to the PATH:

   ```
   python --version
   ```

   This should print the version number of Python installed on your system.

4. Finally, try to rebuild the Node.js project again and see if the issue is resolved.

If the issue persists, you may need to update your Node.js and node-gyp versions to the latest ones.
