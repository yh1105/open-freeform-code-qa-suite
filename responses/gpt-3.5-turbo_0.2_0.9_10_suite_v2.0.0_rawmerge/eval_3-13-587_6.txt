This error is caused by a compatibility issue between Jacoco and Kotlin 1.5.10. To fix this issue, you can try upgrading Jacoco to version 0.8.7 or higher. 

Update your `build.gradle` file with the following changes:
```
kotlin_version = "1.5.10"
...
jacoco {
    toolVersion = "0.8.7"
}
...
distributionUrl=https\://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-7.0.2-all.zip
```

Then, run the test coverage report task again. This should resolve the issue.
