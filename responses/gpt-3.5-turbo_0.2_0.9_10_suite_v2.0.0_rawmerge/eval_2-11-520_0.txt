The issue is that you are not correctly overriding the `operator==` method from the base class `IClient`. In your derived class `SeviceClient`, you are only overriding the `operator==` method for `SeviceClient` objects, but not for `IClient` objects.

To fix this, you need to change the signature of the `operator==` method in the base class `IClient` to take a `const` reference to itself, like this:

```c++
virtual bool operator==(const IClient& anotherClient) const = 0;
```

Then, in your derived class `SeviceClient`, you can override this method like this:

```c++
bool operator==(const IClient<int8_t>& anotherClient) const override {
    // Check if the other client is also a SeviceClient
    const SeviceClient* other = dynamic_cast<const SeviceClient*>(&anotherClient);
    if (other == nullptr) {
        return false;
    }

    // Compare the IDs of the two SeviceClients
    return ID == other->ID;
}
```

Note that we use `dynamic_cast` to check if the `anotherClient` object is actually a `SeviceClient` object. If it is not, we return `false`. If it is, we compare the IDs of the two `SeviceClient` objects and return the result.
