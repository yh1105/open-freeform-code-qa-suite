The "CSRF token mismatch" error occurs when the CSRF token generated by the server does not match the one sent by the client. This can happen due to a number of reasons, including session issues.

Since you mentioned that multiple sessions are being generated for one user, it is possible that the session configuration on the host domain is causing the issue. Here are some things you can check:

1. Make sure that the session driver on the host domain is set to the same as the one on your local environment. Laravel supports several session drivers including file, cookie, database, and redis. If the session driver is different, it could be causing the issue.

2. Check the session cookie settings on the host domain. The session cookie should have the same name and path as the one on your local environment. If the cookie settings are different, it could be causing the issue.

3. Check the server time on the host domain. If the server time is not synchronized with the client time, it could cause issues with session expiration and token validation.

4. Check if there are any caching or proxy servers between the client and server. These servers may cache the session data and cause issues with token validation.

5. Check if there are any security plugins or firewalls on the host domain that may be interfering with the session data.

Once you have identified the issue, you can make the necessary changes to the session configuration on the host domain to resolve the "CSRF token mismatch" error.
