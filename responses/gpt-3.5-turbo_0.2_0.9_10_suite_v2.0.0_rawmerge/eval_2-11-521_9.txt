Yes, the above comment is correct. A constructor is a special method in a class that is automatically called when a new object of that class is created. It is not called explicitly like a regular function. When a new object is created, the constructor is invoked automatically to initialize the object's properties and perform any other necessary setup. This is why it is called a constructor, as it constructs or creates the object.
