This warning is related to Elasticsearch's built-in security features not being enabled, which could potentially make your cluster accessible to anyone. To fix this, you need to enable Elasticsearch security features.

Here are the steps to enable Elasticsearch security features:

1. Open the Elasticsearch configuration file `elasticsearch.yml` located in the `config` directory of your Rails app.

2. Add the following lines to the end of the file:
```
xpack.security.enabled: true
xpack.security.transport.ssl.enabled: true
```

3. Save the file and restart Elasticsearch.

After enabling Elasticsearch security features, you may also need to update your Searchkick configuration to include authentication credentials. You can do this by adding the following lines to your `config/initializers/searchkick.rb` file:
```
Searchkick.client_options = {
  user: "your_username",
  password: "your_password"
}
```

Replace `your_username` and `your_password` with your Elasticsearch authentication credentials.

Once you have made these changes, the Elasticsearch warning should disappear.
