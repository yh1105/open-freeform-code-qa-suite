To connect to Heroku Redis using TLS on Node.js with `node_redis` v3, you should use the `REDIS_TLS_URL` environment variable. Here's an example code snippet:

```javascript
const redis = require('redis');
const url = require('url');

const redisUrl = url.parse(process.env.REDIS_TLS_URL);
const client = redis.createClient(redisUrl.port, redisUrl.hostname, {
  tls: {
    rejectUnauthorized: false
  }
});

client.auth(redisUrl.auth.split(":")[1]);
```

Note that we're using `url.parse` to parse the `REDIS_TLS_URL` environment variable, and then passing the resulting `port` and `hostname` to `redis.createClient`. We're also passing a `tls` object with `rejectUnauthorized` set to `false`, which is necessary because Heroku's Redis instances use self-signed certificates.

Finally, we're authenticating the client using the password from the `REDIS_TLS_URL` environment variable.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
