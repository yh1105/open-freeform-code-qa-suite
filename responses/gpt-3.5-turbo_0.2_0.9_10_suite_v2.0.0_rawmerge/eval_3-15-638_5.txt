To use the SelectByID2 method, you need to know the name and type of the object you want to select. One way to obtain this information is to create reference points on the selected face and edge and use them to identify the objects. Another option is to use the GetFaces/GetFirstFace/GetNextFace methods to obtain the face object and its name, and then use that name in the SelectByID2 method.
