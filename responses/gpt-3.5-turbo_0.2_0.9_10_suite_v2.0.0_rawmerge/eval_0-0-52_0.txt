To remove a package installed using `ng add`, you can use the `npm uninstall` command followed by the package name. 

For example, if you installed the `@angular/material` package using `ng add`, you can remove it using the following command:

```
npm uninstall @angular/material
```

After running this command, the package will be removed from your project and its dependencies will be updated accordingly.
