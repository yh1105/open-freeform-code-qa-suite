The error message indicates that Python is not installed on your system or it is not added to the PATH environment variable. 

To fix this issue, you need to install Python and add it to the PATH environment variable. Here are the steps to follow:

1. Download and install Python from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/. Make sure to download the version that matches your operating system.

2. During the installation process, make sure to select the option to add Python to the PATH environment variable.

3. After the installation is complete, open a new command prompt and type `python --version` to verify that Python is installed and added to the PATH environment variable.

4. Try to rebuild the node-sass module by running the following command in the project directory:

```
npm rebuild node-sass
```

This should rebuild the node-sass module with the correct Python version and fix the build error.

If the above steps do not work, you can try specifying the path to the Python executable using the PYTHON environment variable. For example, if Python is installed in `C:\Python27`, you can set the PYTHON environment variable as follows:

```
set PYTHON=C:\Python27\python.exe
```

Then, try to rebuild the node-sass module again using the `npm rebuild node-sass` command.
