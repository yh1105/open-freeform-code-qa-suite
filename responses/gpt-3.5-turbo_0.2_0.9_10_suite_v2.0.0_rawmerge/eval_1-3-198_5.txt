To read a CSV file from Google Drive, you need to modify the URL of the file. Here's how you can do it:

```python
import pandas as pd

def processURL(url):
    file_id = url.split('/')[-2]
    csv_url = f'https://drive.google.com/uc?id={file_id}&export=download'
    return csv_url

url = 'https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B6GhBwm5vaB2ekdlZW5WZnppb28/view?usp=sharing'
csv_url = processURL(url)
df = pd.read_csv(csv_url)
```

In the `processURL` function, we extract the file ID from the URL and use it to construct a new URL that points to the actual CSV file. We add `&export=download` to the end of the URL to force the download of the file. 

Then, we can use the `pd.read_csv` function to read the CSV file from the new URL.
