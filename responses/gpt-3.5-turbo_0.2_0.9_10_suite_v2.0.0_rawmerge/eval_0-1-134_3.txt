It sounds like you might be referring to Emmet, a plugin that allows you to write shorthand code and expand it into HTML/CSS. 

To use Emmet, you can type out a shorthand code and then press the `Tab` key to expand it. For example, typing `.classname` and then pressing `Tab` should expand into `<div class="classname"></div>`. 

If this isn't working for you, make sure that you have Emmet installed and enabled in your code editor. The steps to do this will vary depending on your editor, but a quick Google search should help you find the necessary steps. 

Additionally, make sure that you are typing the shorthand code correctly. Emmet has a specific syntax that you need to follow in order for it to work. For example, to create a div with a class, you need to start with a period (`.`) followed by the class name. 

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
