You can disable the animation in ViewPager2 by using the `setCurrentItem` method with the `false` parameter. This will disable the smooth scrolling animation and directly show the new fragment. Here's an example:

```
viewPager2.setCurrentItem(position, false);
```

Where `position` is the index of the fragment you want to show.
