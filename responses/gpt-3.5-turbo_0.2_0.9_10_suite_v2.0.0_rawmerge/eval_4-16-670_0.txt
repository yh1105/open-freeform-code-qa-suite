Yes, you can convert your OpenSSH private key to an RSA private key using the `ssh-keygen` command in the terminal. Here are the steps:

1. Open the terminal on your Mac.
2. Run the following command to convert your OpenSSH private key to an RSA private key:

   ```
   ssh-keygen -p -m PEM -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa
   ```

   This command will prompt you to enter a passphrase for your private key. If you don't want to use a passphrase, you can just press Enter.
   
3. After you enter the passphrase (or press Enter), the command will convert your private key to RSA format and save it to `~/.ssh/id_rsa` (overwriting the existing file).

4. You can now use the `id_rsa` file to connect to the server.

5. You do not need to transfer the `id_rsa.pub` file, as it is just the public key that corresponds to your private key. The server administrator should already have this file, as you mentioned that you sent it to them.

Note: If you have multiple SSH keys and want to convert a different key, replace `~/.ssh/id_rsa` in the command with the path to your desired key file.
