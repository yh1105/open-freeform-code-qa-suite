This issue is caused by a bug in GitLab CI/CD where nested parameter expansion is not supported. As a workaround, you can use a script block to perform the nested expansion, like this:

```
variables:
  GIT_BRANCH: ""

job1:
  script:
    - >
      if [[ -n "${CI_MERGE_REQUEST_SOURCE_BRANCH_NAME}" ]]; then
        echo "Using merge request source branch"
        export GIT_BRANCH="${CI_MERGE_REQUEST_SOURCE_BRANCH_NAME}"
      elif [[ -n "${CI_COMMIT_BRANCH}" ]]; then
        echo "Using commit branch"
        export GIT_BRANCH="${CI_COMMIT_BRANCH}"
      else
        echo "Using default branch"
        export GIT_BRANCH="${CI_DEFAULT_BRANCH}"
      fi
    - echo $GIT_BRANCH
```

This script block checks if each variable is set, and sets `GIT_BRANCH` accordingly. The `>` character is used to allow for multi-line commands in the script block.
