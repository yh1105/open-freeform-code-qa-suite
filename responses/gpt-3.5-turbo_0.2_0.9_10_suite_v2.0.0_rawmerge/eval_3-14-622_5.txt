To conform to the ShapeStyle protocol in SwiftUI, you need to implement the `func _apply(to shape: inout _ShapeStyle_Self)` method. In your case, you can simply implement this method in your `RedView` struct and return `self`:

```
struct RedView: ShapeStyle {
    func _apply(to shape: inout _ShapeStyle_Self) {
        // do nothing
    }
}
```

This will allow you to use `RedView` as a fill for your `Circle` shape.
