You need to register the ILogger service in your `ServiceCollection`. You can do this by adding the following line to your `ServiceCollection` configuration:
```c#
services.AddLogging();
```
This will register the `ILoggerFactory` and `ILogger<T>` services, which are required for logging. Your updated `ServiceCollection` configuration should look like this:
```c#
var services = new ServiceCollection()
    .AddLogging()
    .BuildServiceProvider();
```
