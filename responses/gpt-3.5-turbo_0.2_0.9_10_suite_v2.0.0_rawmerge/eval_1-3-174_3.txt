The error message suggests that there might be an issue with the installation of psycopg2. One possible solution is to try installing psycopg2-binary instead of psycopg2. 

You can install it using the following command:

```
conda install psycopg2-binary
```

Then, modify your import statement to:

```python
import psycopg2-binary as psycopg2
```

This should resolve the DLL load error.
