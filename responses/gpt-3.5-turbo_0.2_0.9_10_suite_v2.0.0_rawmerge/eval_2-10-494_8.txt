This error message is related to the `console` crate, which is used in your code. The `console` crate uses the `format_args!` macro internally, which is a macro provided by the Rust standard library. 

The error message suggests that rust-analyzer is having trouble resolving the `format_args!` macro. This could be caused by a few different things, but one possibility is that rust-analyzer is not able to find the Rust standard library. 

To fix this, you can try rebuilding your Rust toolchain. You can do this by running the following command:

```
rustup update
```

If that doesn't work, you can try reinstalling the Rust standard library by running:

```
rustup component add rust-src
```

If neither of these solutions work, you can try disabling the `rust-analyzer` extension in your editor and then re-enabling it. This will force the extension to rebuild its internal cache, which may resolve the issue.

If none of these solutions work, you can try reaching out to the rust-analyzer community for further assistance.
