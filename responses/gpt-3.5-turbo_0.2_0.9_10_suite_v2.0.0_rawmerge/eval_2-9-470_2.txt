This error occurs because the libffi6 library is missing on your system. To fix it, you can follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal and run the following command to install the libffi6 library:

```
sudo apt-get install libffi6
```

2. After the installation is complete, run the following command to update the shared library cache:

```
sudo ldconfig
```

3. Finally, try running your rails command again. It should work now.

If the issue persists, you can try reinstalling the ffi gem by running the following command:

```
gem uninstall ffi
gem install ffi
```

This should fix the issue.
