The error message suggests that there is an issue with the encryption of a message in the `ActiveSupport::MessageEncryptor` module. To fix this error, you can try the following steps:

1. Remove the `master.key` and `credentials.yml.enc` files from the `config` directory:
```
rm -rf config/master.key config/credentials.yml.enc
```
2. Create a new `master.key` file:
```
EDITOR="mate --wait" bin/rails credentials:edit
```
This will open up the credentials file in your text editor. Save and close the file to generate a new `master.key` file.

3. Add the new `master.key` file to your repository and deploy to Heroku:
```
git add config/master.key
git commit -m "Add new master.key file"
git push heroku master
```
This should resolve the encryption error and allow you to deploy your app to Heroku successfully.
