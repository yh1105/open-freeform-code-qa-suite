Currently, there is no `ng rm` command available in Angular CLI to remove a package installed using `ng add`. However, you can manually remove the package by following these steps:

1. Remove the package from `package.json` file by running the following command:

   ```
   npm uninstall <package-name>
   ```

2. Remove the package from `angular.json` file by opening the file and removing the configuration related to the package. For example, if you have installed `@angular/material`, you need to remove the following configuration from `angular.json` file:

   ```
   "styles": [
     "node_modules/@angular/material/prebuilt-themes/indigo-pink.css"
   ],
   "scripts": [],
   "assets": [
     {
       "glob": "**/*",
       "input": "node_modules/@angular/material",
       "output": "/assets/"
     }
   ]
   ```

3. Remove the package files from your project by running the following command:

   ```
   rm -rf node_modules/<package-name>
   ```

After completing these steps, the package will be completely removed from your project.
