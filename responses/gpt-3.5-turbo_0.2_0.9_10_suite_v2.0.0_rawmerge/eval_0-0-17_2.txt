Sure! Here is the revised code that listens for the "enter" key and executes `console.log("good")`:

```javascript
mounted() {
  let editor = new Editor({
    extensions: [
      StarterKit.configure({
        onKeyDown({ event }) {
          if (event.key === "Enter") {
            console.log("good");
          }
        }
      })
    ],
    content: this.value
  });
  this.editor = editor;
}
```

This code uses the `configure` method of the `StarterKit` extension to add an event listener for the "keydown" event. The `onKeyDown` function is called whenever a key is pressed in the editor, and it checks if the key pressed was the "Enter" key. If it was, it executes `console.log("good")`.
