The error message indicates that your app is not using AndroidX, which is a major change in the Android ecosystem that happened in 2018. AndroidX replaces the original support library and provides backward compatibility for newer Android features on older versions of Android. 

To fix this issue, you need to migrate your app to AndroidX. Here are the steps to do so:

1. Open your Flutter project in Android Studio.
2. Click on the "Refactor" menu and select "Migrate to AndroidX".
3. A dialog box will appear, asking you to backup your project. Click on "Do Refactor".
4. Wait for the migration process to complete. This may take a few minutes.
5. Once the migration is complete, save your changes and close Android Studio.
6. Open your project in Visual Studio Code and run the command "flutter clean" to remove any previous build artifacts.
7. Run the command "flutter build appbundle" to generate the Android App Bundle.

This should fix the issue and generate the Android App Bundle successfully.
