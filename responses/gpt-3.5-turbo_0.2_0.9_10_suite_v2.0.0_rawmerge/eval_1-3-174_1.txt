The error message suggests that there might be an issue with the installation of psycopg2. One possible solution is to uninstall and reinstall psycopg2 using pip instead of conda. Here are the steps to do that:

1. Activate your conda environment by running `conda activate wr` in the terminal.
2. Uninstall psycopg2 by running `conda uninstall psycopg2`.
3. Install psycopg2 using pip by running `pip install psycopg2-binary`.

After completing these steps, try running your sample app again and see if the error persists.
