The error message is indicating that you are using a non-primitive value as the key for your `v-for` loop. In this case, you are using the entire `comment` object as the key, which is not recommended.

To fix the issue, you should use a unique identifier for each comment as the key. For example, if each comment has a unique `id` property, you can use that as the key:

```html
<div v-for="comment in comments" :key="comment.id">
```

If there is no unique identifier available, you can use the index of the comment in the array as the key:

```html
<div v-for="(comment, index) in comments" :key="index">
```

Using the index as the key is not ideal, as it can cause issues with reactivity if the order of the array changes. However, it is better than using the entire object as the key.
