To make sure the second query runs only after the first one is fulfilled, you can use the `useEffect` hook with `userFulfilled` as a dependency. Here's the updated code for the second query:

```javascript
const [userId, setUserId] = useState(null);

useEffect(() => {
  if (userFulfilled) {
    setUserId(user.id);
  }
}, [userFulfilled, user.id]);

const { data: userBio } = useGetUserBioQuery(userId);
```

In this code, we use the `useState` hook to store the `userId` value that we need for the second query. Then, we use the `useEffect` hook to set the `userId` value only after the `user` object is fulfilled. Finally, we use the `useGetUserBioQuery` hook with the `userId` value to get the `userBio` data.
