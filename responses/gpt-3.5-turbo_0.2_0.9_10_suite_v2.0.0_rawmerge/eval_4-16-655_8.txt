This issue is caused by a bug in GitLab CI/CD. Nested parameter expansion is not currently supported in GitLab CI/CD. As a workaround, you can use a script block to perform the nested expansion. For example:

```
variables:
  GIT_BRANCH: ""

job1:
  script:
    - |
      if [ -n "${CI_MERGE_REQUEST_SOURCE_BRANCH_NAME}" ]; then
        GIT_BRANCH="${CI_MERGE_REQUEST_SOURCE_BRANCH_NAME}"
      elif [ -n "${CI_COMMIT_BRANCH}" ]; then
        GIT_BRANCH="${CI_COMMIT_BRANCH}"
      else
        GIT_BRANCH="${CI_DEFAULT_BRANCH}"
      fi
    - echo $GIT_BRANCH
```

This script block checks each variable in turn and sets `GIT_BRANCH` to the first non-empty value.
