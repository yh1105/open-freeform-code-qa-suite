To add Jetpack Compose to an existing Android Studio project, you need to make sure that your project is using Android Gradle Plugin version 7.0.0 or higher. Then, you can add the following dependencies to your app's build.gradle file:

```
dependencies {
    implementation 'androidx.core:core-ktx:1.6.0'
    implementation 'androidx.appcompat:appcompat:1.3.1'
    implementation 'androidx.activity:activity-compose:1.3.1'
    implementation 'androidx.compose.ui:ui:1.0.1'
    implementation 'androidx.compose.material:material:1.0.1'
    implementation 'androidx.compose.runtime:runtime-livedata:1.0.1'
}
```

After adding the dependencies, you can start using Jetpack Compose in your existing project. You can create Composable functions and use them in your existing activities or fragments. You can also create new activities or fragments that use Jetpack Compose.
