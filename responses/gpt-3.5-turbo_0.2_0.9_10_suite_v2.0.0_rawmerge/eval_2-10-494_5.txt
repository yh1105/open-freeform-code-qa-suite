This error is caused by a bug in rust-analyzer, which is a language server for Rust that provides IDE-like features such as code completion and error highlighting. The error message is indicating that rust-analyzer is having trouble resolving the `format_args` macro, which is used internally by the `pad_str` function.

Fortunately, this error does not indicate a problem with your code, and it should not affect the behavior of your program. You can safely ignore the error for now, or you can try updating rust-analyzer to see if the issue has been fixed in a newer version.

To update rust-analyzer, you can run the following command in your terminal:

```
rustup component add rust-analyzer-preview
```

This will install the latest version of rust-analyzer, which may resolve the issue. If the error persists, you can try disabling rust-analyzer or using a different IDE or text editor.
