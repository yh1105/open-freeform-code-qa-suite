To transfer native SOL directly into the event account's vault address in an anchor smart contract instruction, you can use the following code:

```
let ix = anchor_lang::solana_program::system_instruction::transfer(
    ctx.accounts.from.to_account_info().key,
    ctx.accounts.to.to_account_info().key,
    amount,
);
anchor_lang::solana_program::program::invoke(
    &ix,
    &[
        ctx.accounts.from.to_account_info(),
        ctx.accounts.to.to_account_info(),
    ],
)?;
```

In this code, `ctx.accounts.from` is the account that will be debited, `ctx.accounts.to` is the account that will be credited, and `amount` is the amount of SOL to transfer. 

Note that `ctx.accounts.from` and `ctx.accounts.to` are Anchor account structs that have been generated from the program's IDL. You will need to ensure that these structs have the correct fields and that the `from` account has sufficient SOL balance to complete the transfer.
