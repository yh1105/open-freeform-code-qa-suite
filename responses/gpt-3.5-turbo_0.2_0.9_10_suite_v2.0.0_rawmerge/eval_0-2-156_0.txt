To move the Stop button to the top and align it properly with the Begin button, you can add the following CSS code to your `style.css` file:

```css
#GameStopped {
  position: relative;
}

#StopBtn {
  position: absolute;
  top: 0;
  left: 0;
}
```

This will make the `#GameStopped` div a relative position container and the `#StopBtn` button an absolute position element. Then, you can use the `top` and `left` properties to position the button at the top left corner of the container. You can adjust the `top` and `left` values to fine-tune the position of the button.
