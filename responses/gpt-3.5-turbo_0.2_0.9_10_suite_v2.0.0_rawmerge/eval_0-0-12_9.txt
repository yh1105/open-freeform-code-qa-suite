The error message you are getting suggests that the username and password you are using to authenticate with Gmail's SMTP server are incorrect. Here are a few things you can try to fix the issue:

1. Double-check that you are using the correct username and password. Make sure there are no typos or mistakes in either field.

2. If you have two-factor authentication enabled on your Gmail account, you will need to generate an app password to use instead of your regular password. You can do this by going to your Google Account settings, selecting "Security," and then scrolling down to the "App passwords" section.

3. If you are still having trouble, you may need to enable "less secure apps" on your Gmail account. This is not recommended for security reasons, but it may be necessary in some cases. You can do this by going to your Google Account settings, selecting "Security," and then scrolling down to the "Less secure app access" section.

Once you have tried these steps, try running your code again and see if the issue is resolved.
