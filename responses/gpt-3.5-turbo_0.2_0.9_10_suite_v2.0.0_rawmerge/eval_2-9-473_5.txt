The error message suggests that there is an issue with message encryption. To fix this error, you can try the following steps:

1. Remove the `master.key` file:
```
rm -rf config/master.key
```

2. Create a new `master.key` file:
```
EDITOR="mate --wait" bin/rails credentials:edit
```
This will open the credentials file in your text editor. Save and close the file to generate a new `master.key` file.

3. Add the new `master.key` file to your repository and deploy to Heroku:
```
git add config/master.key
git commit -m "Add new master.key file"
git push heroku master
```

This should fix the message encryption error and allow you to deploy your app to Heroku successfully.
