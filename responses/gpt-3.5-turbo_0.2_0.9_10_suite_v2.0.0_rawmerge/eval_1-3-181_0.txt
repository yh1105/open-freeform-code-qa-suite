You can use the `numpy.max()` function with the `axis` parameter set to 1 and the index of the column you want to get the maximum value from. Here's the code:

```python
import numpy as np

def getMax(matrix):
    return np.max(matrix[:, :, 2], axis=1).reshape(-1, 1)
```

In this code, `matrix[:, :, 2]` selects the third column of each 2D array in the 3D array, and `np.max()` returns the maximum value of each row. The `axis=1` parameter tells `np.max()` to calculate the maximum value along the rows. Finally, `reshape(-1, 1)` reshapes the resulting 1D array into a 2D array with a single column and as many rows as there were in the original 3D array.
