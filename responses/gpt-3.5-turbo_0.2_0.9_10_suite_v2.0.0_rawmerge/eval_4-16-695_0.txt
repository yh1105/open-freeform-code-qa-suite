You can try using the `--no-cache` flag with the `docker build` command. This will force Docker to rebuild all the layers, including the ones that were previously cached. This should give you the full build output, including the results of the `ls -la` commands in steps 7 and 15.

For example, you can run the following command to rebuild your Docker image with the `--no-cache` flag:

```
docker build --no-cache -t my-image .
```

This should give you the full build output, including the results of the `ls -la` commands in steps 7 and 15.
