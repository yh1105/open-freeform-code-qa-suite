The reason it didn't work is that this needs to be done inside a function or a method, not at the top level.

Another solution is to declare your map in Flutter with the keyword "late". Here's an example:

```dart
late Map<String, int> someMap;

void main() {
  someMap = {
    "a": 1,
    "b": 2,
  };

  someMap["c"] = 3;
}
```

Using the "late" keyword allows you to declare a variable without initializing it immediately. You can then initialize it later in your code.
