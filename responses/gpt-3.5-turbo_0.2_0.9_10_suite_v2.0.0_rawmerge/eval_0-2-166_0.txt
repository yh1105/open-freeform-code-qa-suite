TailwindCSS is a utility-first CSS framework, which means it provides pre-defined classes that you can use to style your HTML elements. To select direct children of a div with class "section" using TailwindCSS, you can use the `>` selector in combination with the `class` attribute.

Here's an example:

```html
<div class="section">
  <div class="child">Child 1</div>
  <div class="child">Child 2</div>
</div>
```

To select the direct children of the div with class "section", you can use the following TailwindCSS classes:

```html
<div class="section">
  <div class=">child">Child 1</div>
  <div class=">child">Child 2</div>
</div>
```

Note that the `>` selector is used as part of the class name, and the class name is prefixed with a `>` character. This tells TailwindCSS to apply the styles only to direct children of the div with class "section".
