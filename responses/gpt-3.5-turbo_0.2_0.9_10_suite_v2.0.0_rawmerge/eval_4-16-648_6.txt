This error message indicates that the file system is mounted as read-only, which means that you cannot create new directories or modify existing files. 

To resolve this issue, you can try the following steps:

1. Check the file system status by running the following command:

   ```
   mount | grep ' / '
   ```

   This will show you the status of the root file system. If it is mounted as read-only, you will need to remount it as read-write.

2. Remount the file system as read-write by running the following command:

   ```
   sudo mount -uw /
   ```

   This will remount the root file system as read-write.

3. Try creating the directory again by running the following command:

   ```
   sudo mkdir -p /data/db
   ```

   This should create the directory without any issues.

If you are still unable to create the directory, it is possible that there is an issue with your file system or disk. In this case, you may need to run disk utility to repair any errors or replace the disk if necessary.
