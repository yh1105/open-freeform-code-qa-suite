The "CSRF token mismatch" error occurs when the CSRF token in the request does not match the token stored in the session. This can happen if the session is not being properly maintained or if the token is not being included in the request.

Based on your description, it seems like the issue may be related to the session management on the host domain. Here are a few things you can check:

1. Make sure that the session driver on the host domain is set to the same as the one on your local environment. If you are using the file driver locally, make sure that it is also set to file on the host domain.

2. Check the session configuration on the host domain. Make sure that the session cookie domain and path are set correctly. If they are not set correctly, the session may not be shared across different subdomains or paths.

3. Check if there are any caching mechanisms in place on the host domain that may be interfering with the session management. If there are, make sure that they are configured to properly handle sessions.

4. Check if there are any security measures in place on the host domain that may be blocking or modifying requests. If there are, make sure that they are not interfering with the CSRF token or session management.

5. Check if there are any differences in the PHP configuration between your local environment and the host domain. If there are, make sure that they are not affecting the session management.

I hope this helps you identify and resolve the issue.
