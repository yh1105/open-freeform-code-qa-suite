To make sure the second query runs only after the first one is fulfilled, you can use the `useEffect` hook and add `user.id` as a dependency. Here's the updated code for the second query:

```javascript
const { data: userBio, isFulfilled: userBioFulfilled } = useGetUserBioQuery(user.id);

useEffect(() => {
  if (userFulfilled) {
    // Only run the second query if the first one is fulfilled
    userBioFulfilled || refetch(); // refetch the second query if it hasn't been fulfilled yet
  }
}, [user.id, userFulfilled, userBioFulfilled]);
```

This code uses the `useEffect` hook to run a function after the component has rendered and every time `user.id`, `userFulfilled`, or `userBioFulfilled` changes. The function checks if the first query is fulfilled (`userFulfilled`) and if so, it checks if the second query is also fulfilled (`userBioFulfilled`). If the second query hasn't been fulfilled yet, it calls the `refetch` function to fetch the data again.
