You can modify your code to check if the string contains `_` or not. If it contains `_`, then split the string and return everything after the first `_`. If it doesn't contain `_`, then return the original string.

Here's the modified code:

```python
def splitOne(s):
    if '_' in s:
        return '_'.join(s.split('_')[1:])
    else:
        return s
```

This function first checks if `_` is present in the string `s`. If it is present, then it splits the string using `_` as the separator and returns everything after the first `_`. If `_` is not present in the string, then it simply returns the original string.

Here are some examples of how this function works:

```python
>>> splitOne('testing_abc')
'abc'
>>> splitOne('xyz')
'xyz'
>>> splitOne('testing_abc_bbc')
'abc_bbc'
>>> splitOne('no_underscore')
'no_underscore'
```
