This is a known issue with GitLab CI/CD and nested parameter expansion. As a workaround, you can use a script block to perform the nested expansion, like this:

```
variables:
  GIT_BRANCH: ""

job1:
  script:
    - GIT_BRANCH="${CI_MERGE_REQUEST_SOURCE_BRANCH_NAME:-${CI_COMMIT_BRANCH:-$CI_DEFAULT_BRANCH}}"
    - echo $GIT_BRANCH
``` 

This should output the expected value of `GIT_BRANCH`.
