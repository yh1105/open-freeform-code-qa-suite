It seems that you need to properly identify the object name and type to select it using the SelectByID2 method. One way to do this is to create reference points using appropriate Selection methods, because their names are known, and then use those for SelectByID2 method. You can also try using the GetFaces/GetFirstFace/GetNextFace methods, but keep in mind that InsertRefPlane requires objects to be selected by SelectByID2.
