To read a CSV file from Google Drive, you need to modify the URL to include the file ID and export it as a CSV. Here's how you can modify the URL and read the CSV using pandas:

```python
import pandas as pd

def processURL(url):
    file_id = url.split('/')[-2]
    dwn_url = 'https://drive.google.com/uc?id=' + file_id
    return pd.read_csv(dwn_url)
```

In this function, we first extract the file ID from the URL by splitting the URL and taking the second to last element. Then we construct a new URL by appending the file ID to the base URL `https://drive.google.com/uc?id=`. Finally, we use `pd.read_csv()` to read the CSV from the new URL and return the resulting dataframe.
