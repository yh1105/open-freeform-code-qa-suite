The warning is due to the fact that the value returned by `myMap[1]` is of type `String?` (nullable string) because the `containsKey` method only checks if the key exists in the map, but it does not guarantee that the value associated with the key is not null.

To solve the warning, you can either change the type of the variable `s` to `String?` or use the null-aware operator `?` to check if the value is not null before assigning it to `s`. Here are two possible solutions:

```dart
void foo(Map<int, String> myMap) {
  if (myMap.containsKey(1)) {
    String? s = myMap[1]; // Solution 1: change the type of s to String?
    String s2 = myMap[1]!; // Solution 2: use the null-aware operator !
  }
}
```

In solution 1, the type of `s` is changed to `String?` to match the type of the value returned by `myMap[1]`.

In solution 2, the null-aware operator `!` is used to assert that the value returned by `myMap[1]` is not null. This is safe to do in this case because we have already checked that the key exists in the map using `containsKey`.
