This error can occur if there is a mismatch between the version of psycopg2 you installed and the version of PostgreSQL you are using. 

You can try uninstalling psycopg2 and then installing it again using pip instead of conda. To do this, activate your conda environment and run the following commands in your terminal:

```
conda remove psycopg2
pip install psycopg2-binary
```

The `psycopg2-binary` package includes the necessary binary files, so you don't need to worry about compiling anything. 

If this doesn't work, you can try installing a different version of psycopg2 that matches your PostgreSQL version. You can find a list of available versions on the PyPI page for psycopg2: https://pypi.org/project/psycopg2/#history. 

For example, if you are using PostgreSQL 10, you can try installing psycopg2 version 2.7.7:

```
pip install psycopg2==2.7.7
```

I hope this helps!
