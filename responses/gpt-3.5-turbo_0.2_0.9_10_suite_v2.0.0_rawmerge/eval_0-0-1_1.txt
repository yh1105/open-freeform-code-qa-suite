It's possible that the issue is caused by the dynamic route, but it's hard to say without more information. Here are a few things you can try to troubleshoot the issue:

1. Check the Vercel logs: When you deploy your app to Vercel, it should give you a URL to view the logs. Check the logs to see if there are any errors or warnings that might be causing the issue.

2. Check your `package.json` file: Make sure that the `start` script in your `package.json` file is set to `next start`. This is the command that Vercel will use to start your app.

3. Check your `next.config.js` file: If you have a `next.config.js` file, make sure that it's configured correctly for your app. If you don't have one, you might need to create one to configure your dynamic routes.

4. Check your dynamic route: Make sure that your dynamic route is set up correctly. You might need to use the `getStaticPaths` and `getStaticProps` functions to generate the dynamic pages at build time.

5. Check your file names: Make sure that your file names are correct and match the names of your pages and components. Next.js is case-sensitive, so make sure that your file names match the names in your code.

6. Check your file paths: Make sure that your file paths are correct and match the paths in your code. Next.js uses the file system to determine the routes for your app, so make sure that your file paths match the routes you want to create.

Hopefully one of these steps will help you identify the issue and get your app deployed to Vercel successfully.
