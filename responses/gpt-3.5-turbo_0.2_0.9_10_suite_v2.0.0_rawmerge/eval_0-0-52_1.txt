To remove a package installed using `ng add`, you can use the `npm uninstall` command followed by the package name. For example, if you installed the `@angular/material` package using `ng add`, you can remove it using the following command:

```
npm uninstall @angular/material
```

This will remove the package and any dependencies that were installed with it. Note that this will not remove any code or configuration changes that were made as part of the package installation. You will need to manually remove any code or configuration changes that were made.
