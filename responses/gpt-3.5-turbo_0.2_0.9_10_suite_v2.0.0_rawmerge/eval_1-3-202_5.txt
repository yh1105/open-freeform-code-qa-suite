It seems like there is an issue with removing the `requests` and `setuptools` packages from the conda environment. One possible solution is to create a new environment and install the required packages in that environment. Here are the steps to create a new environment and install the required packages:

1. Open the Anaconda prompt.
2. Create a new environment by running the following command: `conda create --name myenv python=3.6`.
3. Activate the new environment by running the following command: `conda activate myenv`.
4. Install the required packages by running the following command: `conda install --file python3.6-environment-windows.yml`.

This should create a new environment and install the required packages without any issues.
