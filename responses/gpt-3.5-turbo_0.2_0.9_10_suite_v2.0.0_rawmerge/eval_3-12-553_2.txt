The error message indicates that your app is not using AndroidX, which is a major change in the Android ecosystem that happened in 2018. AndroidX replaces the original support library and provides backward compatibility for newer Android features on older versions of Android.

To fix this issue, you need to migrate your app to AndroidX. You can do this by following the steps provided in the error message or by using the Android Studio Refactor tool.

To use the Refactor tool, follow these steps:

1. Open your Flutter project in Android Studio.
2. Click on the "Refactor" menu and select "Migrate to AndroidX".
3. Follow the prompts to complete the migration process.

After migrating to AndroidX, try building the app again using the command "flutter build appbundle". This should generate the Android project study and its APK without any issues.
