You can try running the following command in your terminal:

```
source ~/.bash_profile
```

This will reload your updated `.bash_profile` without closing the terminal window. Alternatively, you can also use the following command:

```
. ~/.bash_profile
```

Both of these commands will reload your `.bash_profile` and apply any changes you made to it.
