This error usually occurs when Xcode is unable to execute a script during the build process. Here are some steps you can try to resolve the issue:

1. Clean the project: Go to Product > Clean Build Folder (hold down the Option key to reveal the menu option).

2. Delete the derived data: Go to Xcode > Preferences > Locations and click on the arrow next to the Derived Data folder. Delete the folder for your project.

3. Check for any missing or incorrect paths: Make sure that all the paths in your project are correct and that any required files or frameworks are included.

4. Check for any missing or incorrect permissions: Make sure that all the necessary permissions are set for your project and that your account has the necessary permissions to access the required files and folders.

5. Update your pods: Try updating your pods to the latest version by running `pod update` in the terminal.

6. Disable bitcode: Go to Build Settings and set "Enable Bitcode" to "No".

7. Check for any conflicting scripts: If you have any custom scripts in your project, make sure they are not conflicting with the build process.

If none of these steps work, you may need to provide more information about the error message or seek further assistance from the Xcode community.
