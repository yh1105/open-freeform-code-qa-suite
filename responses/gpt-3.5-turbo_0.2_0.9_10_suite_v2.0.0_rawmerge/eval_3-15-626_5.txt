You can use the `WorkbookConnection` object in VBA to automate a Power Query. Here's an example code snippet:

```
Sub RefreshPowerQuery()
    Dim conn As WorkbookConnection
    Set conn = ThisWorkbook.Connections("Query - MyQueryName")
    conn.Refresh
End Sub
```

Replace "Query - MyQueryName" with the name of your Power Query connection. You can also use the `WorkbookQuery` object to create a new Power Query and load the results to a worksheet.
