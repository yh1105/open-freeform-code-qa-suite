The error message suggests that there is an issue with the encryption of messages in your Rails app. To fix this, you can try resetting your app's secret key base on Heroku by running the following command:
```
heroku config:set SECRET_KEY_BASE=`rails secret`
```
This will generate a new secret key base and set it as an environment variable on your Heroku app.

As for the error when deploying to Heroku, it seems like there may be an issue with the pre-receive hook on the remote repository. You can try force pushing your changes to Heroku by running the following command:
```
git push heroku master --force
```
This will overwrite the remote repository with your local changes. However, be cautious when using the `--force` flag as it can potentially cause data loss if used incorrectly.

Regarding the [blank]s, you should remove the `master.key` file by running:
```
rm -rf config/master.key
```
And create a new `master.key` file by running:
```
EDITOR="mate --wait" bin/rails credentials:edit
```
This will open the credentials file in your preferred text editor and generate a new `master.key` file if it doesn't exist already.
