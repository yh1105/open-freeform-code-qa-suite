This error message indicates that the Firefox browser binary location is not set or cannot be found. You can try the following solutions:

1. Install Firefox browser on your computer if you haven't already.

2. If you have already installed Firefox, make sure that the browser binary is in the default location. If it's not, you can specify the path to the binary using the `executable_path` argument when creating the `webdriver.Firefox()` instance. For example:

   ```python
   from selenium import webdriver
   browser = webdriver.Firefox(executable_path='/path/to/firefox/binary')
   browser.get('http://www.seleniumhq.org')
   ```

3. If you don't want to specify the path to the binary every time you create a `webdriver.Firefox()` instance, you can add the path to the Firefox binary to your system's PATH environment variable. This will allow Selenium to find the binary automatically. 

   For example, if you're using Windows and Firefox is installed in the default location, you can add `C:\Program Files\Mozilla Firefox\` to the PATH environment variable. If you're using macOS, you can add `/Applications/Firefox.app/Contents/MacOS/` to the PATH environment variable.

   After adding the path to the PATH environment variable, you can create a `webdriver.Firefox()` instance without specifying the `executable_path` argument:

   ```python
   from selenium import webdriver
   browser = webdriver.Firefox()
   browser.get('http://www.seleniumhq.org')
   ```
