Yes, there is a way to detect if the user's system is in Dark Mode on macOS. You can use the `prefers-color-scheme` media query in CSS to detect if the user has enabled Dark Mode.

Here's an example:

```css
@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
  /* Styles for Dark Mode */
}

@media (prefers-color-scheme: light) {
  /* Styles for Light Mode */
}
```

This will apply the styles inside the `@media` block based on the user's system preference. If the user has enabled Dark Mode, the styles inside the `dark` block will be applied. If the user has not enabled Dark Mode, the styles inside the `light` block will be applied.

You can also use JavaScript to detect the user's system preference:

```javascript
if (window.matchMedia && window.matchMedia('(prefers-color-scheme: dark)').matches) {
  // User has enabled Dark Mode
} else {
  // User has not enabled Dark Mode
}
```

This will allow you to change your site's design based on the user's system preference.
