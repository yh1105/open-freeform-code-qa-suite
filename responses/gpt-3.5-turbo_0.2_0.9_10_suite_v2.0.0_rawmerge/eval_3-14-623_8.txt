This error message usually indicates that there is a problem with the Swift code in your project. Here are some steps you can try to resolve the issue:

1. Clean your project: Go to Product > Clean Build Folder in Xcode. This will delete all the intermediate build files and force Xcode to rebuild them.

2. Delete derived data: Go to Xcode Preferences > Locations and click on the arrow next to the Derived Data folder. Delete the contents of this folder.

3. Check for any syntax errors in your Swift code: Look for any red error messages in your code and fix them.

4. Check for any missing or outdated dependencies: Make sure all your dependencies are up-to-date and compatible with Xcode 10. You can try updating your CocoaPods installation by running `sudo gem install cocoapods` in Terminal.

5. Try disabling the Swift compiler optimization: Go to Build Settings > Swift Compiler - Code Generation and set Optimization Level to None.

6. Try disabling the whole module optimization: Go to Build Settings > Swift Compiler - Code Generation and set Whole Module Optimization to No.

7. Try cleaning the project and deleting the derived data again after trying each of the above steps.

If none of these steps work, you may need to dig deeper into the error messages to find the root cause of the problem. You can try looking at the build log in Xcode to see if there are any more specific error messages that can help you diagnose the issue.
