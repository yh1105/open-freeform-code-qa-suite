Yes, you can convert your OpenSSH private key to an RSA private key using the `ssh-keygen` command. Here are the steps:

1. Open Terminal on your Mac.
2. Type the following command to convert the key:

   ```
   ssh-keygen -p -m PEM -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa
   ```

   This command will prompt you to enter a passphrase for the key (if you have one set), and then it will convert the key to the PEM format and save it to `~/.ssh/id_rsa`.

3. To verify that the key has been converted, you can check the header of the key file by typing:

   ```
   head -n 1 ~/.ssh/id_rsa
   ```

   The output should be `-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----`.

4. You do not need to transfer your `id_rsa.pub` file, as it is just the public key that corresponds to your private key. The server administrator only needs your public key to grant you access to the server.
