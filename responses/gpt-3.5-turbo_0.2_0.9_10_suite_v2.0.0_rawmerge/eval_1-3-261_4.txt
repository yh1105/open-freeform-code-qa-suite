The error message `HTTP Error 410: Gone` indicates that the video you are trying to download is no longer available on YouTube. This could be due to various reasons such as the video being removed by the uploader, a copyright claim, or the video being age-restricted.

You can try with a different video URL to see if the issue persists. If the issue persists, you can try using a different library such as `youtube_dl` or `pafy` to download the video. Here's an example using `youtube_dl`:

```python
import youtube_dl

# ask for the link from user
link = input("Enter the link of YouTube video you want to download: ")

# download the video
ydl_opts = {}
with youtube_dl.YoutubeDL(ydl_opts) as ydl:
    ydl.download([link])
    
print("Download completed!!")
```

Make sure to install `youtube_dl` library using `pip install youtube_dl`.
