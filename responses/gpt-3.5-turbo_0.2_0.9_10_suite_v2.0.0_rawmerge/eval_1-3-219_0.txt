Here are a few things you can try to solve the issue:

1. Make sure that you have the latest version of the Python extension installed in VS Code. You can check this by going to the Extensions tab and searching for "Python".

2. Try running Jupyter notebook outside of VS Code to see if it works. Open a command prompt or terminal window and activate your virtual environment by running `conda activate da38`. Then run the command `jupyter notebook` and see if it launches successfully. If it does, then the issue may be with VS Code.

3. Try creating a new virtual environment and installing Jupyter notebook in it. Activate the new environment and install Jupyter notebook by running `conda install jupyter`. Then try launching Jupyter notebook from within VS Code again.

4. Check if there are any firewall or antivirus settings that may be blocking the connection to the IPython kernel. Try temporarily disabling them and see if it makes a difference.

5. If none of the above solutions work, you can try resetting the VS Code settings to their defaults. Go to the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P) and search for "Preferences: Open User Settings". Then click on the "Open Settings (JSON)" button and delete all the contents of the file. Save the file and restart VS Code.
