If the `"python.linting.jediEnabled": false` line is greyed out, it means that it is being overridden by another setting. To find out which setting is overriding it, you can search for `jedi` in your settings.json file and see if there are any other settings related to it.

Alternatively, you can try disabling Jedi directly from the VS Code settings UI. To do this, go to File > Preferences > Settings, search for "python.jediEnabled" and uncheck the box. This should disable Jedi and prevent it from interfering with your Pylint linter.

If neither of these solutions work, you can try reinstalling the Python extension for VS Code or resetting your VS Code settings to their default values.
