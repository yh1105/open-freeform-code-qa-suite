The Rule of 5 is not outdated and is still relevant today. While it is true that implicit constructors and destructors work fine for aggregate data structures, there are cases where user-defined constructors and destructors are necessary.

For example, if a class manages a resource that cannot be handled by a smart pointer, such as a file handle or a network socket, then a user-defined destructor is necessary to properly release that resource. Similarly, if a class has non-copyable or non-movable members, then user-defined copy and move constructors and assignment operators are necessary to properly manage those members.

In addition, there may be cases where a class needs to perform additional actions during construction or destruction that cannot be handled by the default constructors and destructors. For example, a class may need to initialize a member variable to a specific value during construction or perform some cleanup actions during destruction.

While it is true that smart pointers can be used to manage resources, they are not always the best solution. Smart pointers add additional overhead and can be less efficient than managing resources directly. In addition, smart pointers do not solve all of the problems that user-defined constructors and destructors can address.

In summary, while the Rule of 5 may not be necessary for all classes, it is still an important guideline to follow for classes that manage resources or have non-copyable or non-movable members.
