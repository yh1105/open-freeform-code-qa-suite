This error is caused by the `console` crate using the `format_args!` macro, which is a macro that is used to format strings. Rust-analyzer is not able to resolve this macro, which is causing the error.

To fix this error, you can try updating your Rust toolchain to the latest version. If that doesn't work, you can try adding the following to your `Cargo.toml` file:

```toml
[profile.dev.package."console"]
default-features = false
```

This will disable the default features of the `console` crate, which includes the `formatting` feature that is causing the error. By disabling this feature, you should be able to resolve the error.

If neither of these solutions work, you can try disabling the `rust-analyzer` extension in your editor and using the built-in Rust language server instead.
