The error message you are seeing indicates that there is a problem with the line endings in the `npm` executable. This is a common issue when using files created in Windows on a Linux system.

To fix this issue, you can use the `dos2unix` command to convert the line endings of the `npm` executable. Here are the steps:

1. Install `dos2unix` by running the command `sudo apt-get install dos2unix`.
2. Navigate to the directory where the `npm` executable is located by running the command `cd /mnt/c/Program\ Files/nodejs/`.
3. Convert the line endings of the `npm` executable by running the command `sudo dos2unix npm`.
4. Make the `npm` executable executable by running the command `sudo chmod +x npm`.
5. Try running `npm -v` again and it should work.

If you still encounter issues, you can try uninstalling and reinstalling `nodejs` and `npm`.
