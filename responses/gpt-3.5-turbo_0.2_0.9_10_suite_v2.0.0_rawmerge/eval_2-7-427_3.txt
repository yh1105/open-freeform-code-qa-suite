For the first issue, the "CSRF token mismatch" error could be caused by a few things. One possibility is that the server's clock is not synchronized with the client's clock, causing the token to expire before it should. Another possibility is that there is a caching issue on the server that is causing the token to be reused or invalidated prematurely. You could try clearing the cache on the server and see if that resolves the issue. Additionally, you could try increasing the SESSION_LIFETIME to see if that helps.

For the second issue, the error message suggests that the SSL version being used is incorrect. You could try changing the encryption method to 'tls' instead of 'ssl' in your .env file and see if that resolves the issue. Additionally, you could try changing the port to 465 instead of 587, as some SMTP servers use that port for SSL connections. If those solutions don't work, you may need to contact the email provider for further assistance.
