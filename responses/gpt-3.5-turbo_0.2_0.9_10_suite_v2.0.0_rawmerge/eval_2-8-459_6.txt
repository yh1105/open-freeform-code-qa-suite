It seems like the module `github.ibm.com/kms/key-protect-client` is not being downloaded to the module cache on computer B. Here are some steps you can take to debug this issue:

1. Check if the module is present in the module cache on computer B. You can find the module cache location by running the following command:

   ```bash
   go env GOMODCACHE
   ```

   This will print the path to the module cache. Check if the module `github.ibm.com/kms/key-protect-client` is present in this directory.

2. If the module is not present in the module cache, try running the following command to download the module:

   ```bash
   go get github.ibm.com/kms/key-protect-client@v0.1.5
   ```

   This will download the module and its dependencies to the module cache.

3. If the module is present in the module cache, try running the following command to verify the module version:

   ```bash
   go list -m github.ibm.com/kms/key-protect-client
   ```

   This will print the version of the module that is present in the module cache. Make sure that the version matches the version specified in your `go.mod` file.

4. If the module version is correct, try running the following command to verify the module checksum:

   ```bash
   go mod verify
   ```

   This will verify the checksum of all modules in your `go.mod` file. If the checksum of the `github.ibm.com/kms/key-protect-client` module does not match, it means that the module has been modified since it was downloaded to the module cache.

5. If none of the above steps work, try running the following command to clear the module cache and download all modules again:

   ```bash
   go clean -modcache
   go mod download
   ```

   This will clear the module cache and download all modules again. This may take some time, but it should ensure that all modules are downloaded correctly.

I hope this helps you debug the issue. Let me know if you have any further questions!
