Here's a possible implementation of the `func` function in Python:

```python
def func(n, k):
    if n == 1:
        return k
    if n == 2:
        return k * (k - 1) + k
    dp = [0] * (n + 1)
    dp[1] = k
    dp[2] = k * (k - 1) + k
    for i in range(3, n + 1):
        dp[i] = (k - 1) * (dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2])
    return dp[n]
```

The function uses dynamic programming to compute the number of ways to form a string of length `n` using `k` characters such that at most two adjacent characters can be same. The idea is to build the solution for `n` by using the solutions for `n-1` and `n-2`.

The base cases are `n=1` and `n=2`, where the number of ways to form a string is simply `k` and `k*(k-1)+k`, respectively.

For `n>2`, we use a dynamic programming approach where we compute the number of ways to form a string of length `i` using `k` characters such that at most two adjacent characters can be same. We use the recurrence relation:

```
dp[i] = (k-1) * (dp[i-1] + dp[i-2])
```

This is because we can form a string of length `i` by appending a character different from the previous one to a string of length `i-1`, or by appending two characters different from the previous one to a string of length `i-2`. We multiply by `k-1` because we cannot use the same character as the previous one.

Finally, we return `dp[n]`, which is the number of ways to form a string of length `n` using `k` characters such that at most two adjacent characters can be same.
