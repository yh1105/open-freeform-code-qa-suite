To disable the back button in Flutter when you have reached the login page after logging out, you can use the `pushReplacement` method instead of `push` when navigating to the login page. This will replace the current page in the navigation stack with the login page, so when the user presses the back button, they will not be taken back to the previous page. Here's an example:

```
Navigator.pushReplacement(
  context,
  MaterialPageRoute(builder: (context) => LoginPage()),
);
```

Note that this will also prevent the user from using the back button to navigate back to any previous pages in the app, so use it with caution.
