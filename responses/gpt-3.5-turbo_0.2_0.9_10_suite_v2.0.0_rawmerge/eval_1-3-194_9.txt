Sure, here's the code for the `writeToExcel` function:

```python
import openpyxl

def writeToExcel():
    new_list = [["first", "second"], ["third", "fourth"]]
    wb = openpyxl.Workbook()
    sheet = wb.active
    for row in new_list:
        sheet.append(row)
    wb.save("data.xlsx")
```

This function uses the `openpyxl` library to create a new Excel workbook and write the contents of `new_list` to the first sheet of the workbook. The `append` method is used to add each row of the list to the sheet. Finally, the workbook is saved as "data.xlsx".
