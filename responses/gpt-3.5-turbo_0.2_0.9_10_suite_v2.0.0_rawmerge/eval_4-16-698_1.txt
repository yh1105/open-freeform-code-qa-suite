You can use the following command to restart your current terminal session without closing the window on MacOS:

```
source ~/.bash_profile
```

This will reload your updated `.bash_profile` file and apply any changes you made to it. It's equivalent to logging out and logging back in again, but without actually closing the terminal window.
