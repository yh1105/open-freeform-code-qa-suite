The `FormatException: Unexpected character (at character 1)` error occurs when the response from the server is not in a valid JSON format. 

To solve this error, you can try the following steps:

1. Check the response from the server using a tool like Postman or Insomnia to ensure that it is a valid JSON format.

2. Make sure that the response from the server is not empty. If it is empty, you will get a `FormatException` error.

3. Check the encoding of the response. If the encoding is not `utf-8`, you may need to change the encoding in your code.

4. If the response is valid JSON, you can try using the `try-catch` block to catch the `FormatException` error and handle it appropriately. For example, you can display an error message to the user or log the error for debugging purposes.

Here is an example of how to use the `try-catch` block to catch the `FormatException` error:

```dart
try {
  List data = json.decode(response.body);
  // process the data
} catch (e) {
  print('Error decoding JSON: $e');
  // handle the error
}
```
