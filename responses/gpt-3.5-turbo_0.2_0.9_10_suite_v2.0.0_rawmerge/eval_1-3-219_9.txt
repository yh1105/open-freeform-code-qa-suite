Here are some steps you can try to solve the issue:

1. Make sure that the Jupyter package is installed in your virtual environment. You can do this by activating your virtual environment and running the command `conda list` or `pip list` to see if Jupyter is listed.

2. Check if the Jupyter notebook is working outside of VS Code. Open a command prompt or terminal and activate your virtual environment. Then run the command `jupyter notebook` to see if it launches successfully. If it does, then the issue may be with VS Code.

3. Try resetting the Jupyter kernel. In VS Code, go to the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P) and search for "Jupyter: Specify local or remote Jupyter server for connections". Select "Local" and then select "Python 3.8.5 64-bit ('da38':conda)" as the kernel. Then try running the Jupyter notebook again.

4. If none of the above steps work, try uninstalling and reinstalling the Jupyter package in your virtual environment. You can do this by activating your virtual environment and running the command `conda remove jupyter` or `pip uninstall jupyter`, followed by `conda install jupyter` or `pip install jupyter`.

Hopefully, one of these steps will solve your issue and allow you to launch Jupyter notebook in VS Code.
