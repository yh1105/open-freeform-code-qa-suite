The error message indicates that Python is not installed on your system or it is not added to the PATH environment variable. 

To fix this issue, you need to install Python and add it to the PATH environment variable. Here are the steps to follow:

1. Download and install Python from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

2. During the installation process, make sure to select the option to add Python to the PATH environment variable.

3. After the installation is complete, open a new command prompt and run the following command to verify that Python is installed and added to the PATH:

   ```
   python --version
   ```

   This should display the version of Python installed on your system.

4. Try running the build again and see if the issue is resolved.

If you still encounter the same issue, you may need to set the PYTHON environment variable to the path of the Python executable. You can do this by running the following command in the command prompt:

```
set PYTHON=C:\path\to\python.exe
```

Replace `C:\path\to\python.exe` with the actual path to the Python executable on your system. 

After setting the PYTHON environment variable, try running the build again and see if the issue is resolved.
