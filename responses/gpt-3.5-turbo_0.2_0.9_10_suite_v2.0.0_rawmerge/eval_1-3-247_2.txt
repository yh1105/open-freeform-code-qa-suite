The error message is indicating that the `profile` URL pattern is expecting a non-empty string argument, but it is receiving an empty string instead. The issue is most likely in the `index.html` template where you are trying to pass an empty string as the argument for the `profile` URL.

The line that is causing the error is:

```html
<a href="{% url 'profile' post.author.username %}">
```

It is possible that some of the `NewPost` objects in your database do not have an author associated with them, which is causing the `post.author.username` to evaluate to an empty string. To fix this, you can add a check to make sure that the author is not `None` before trying to access the username:

```html
{% if post.author %}
    <a href="{% url 'profile' post.author.username %}">
        @{{post.author.username}}
    </a>
{% endif %}
```

This will only generate the link if the `post` has an associated `author`.
