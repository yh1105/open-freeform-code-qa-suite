The error message suggests that there is an issue with loading the `_psycopg` module, which is a C extension module that is part of the `psycopg2` package. This can happen if the C extension was not compiled correctly or if there is a mismatch between the Python version and the compiled extension.

Here are a few things you can try to resolve the issue:

1. Make sure that you have installed the correct version of `psycopg2` for your Python environment. You can check the Python version by running `python --version` in the command prompt. You can check the version of `psycopg2` by running `conda list psycopg2` in the command prompt.

2. Try uninstalling and reinstalling `psycopg2` using `conda`. You can do this by running `conda remove psycopg2` followed by `conda install psycopg2`.

3. If the above steps do not work, you can try installing `psycopg2-binary` instead of `psycopg2`. This package includes pre-compiled binaries for Windows and does not require a C compiler. You can install it using `conda install psycopg2-binary`.

4. If none of the above steps work, you can try installing a different version of `psycopg2` that is compatible with your Python environment. You can find a list of available versions on the `psycopg2` PyPI page: https://pypi.org/project/psycopg2/#history. You can install a specific version using `conda install psycopg2==<version>`.

I hope this helps!
