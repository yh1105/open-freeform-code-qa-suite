It seems like the issue is with the way you are running the Vite server inside the Docker container. By default, Vite binds to `localhost` which means it can only be accessed from within the container itself. To make it accessible from outside the container, you need to bind it to `0.0.0.0` which will make it accessible from any IP address.

To do this, you can modify the `server` configuration in your `vite.config.ts` file to include the `host` property:

```typescript
export default defineConfig({
    // ...
    server: {
        port: 8080,
        host: '0.0.0.0'
    }
})
```

This will make the Vite server accessible from outside the container.

Additionally, you may need to modify the `docker-compose.yml` file to include the `host` property in the `ports` section:

```yaml
version: '3.7'

services:
  app:
    image: myapp
    build: .
    container_name: myapp
    ports:
      - "0.0.0.0:8080:8080"
```

This will ensure that the container's port is bound to `0.0.0.0` as well.

After making these changes, you should be able to access the Vite server from your host machine using `localhost:8080`.
