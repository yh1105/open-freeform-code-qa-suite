This warning is related to Elasticsearch built-in security features not being enabled, which means that your Elasticsearch cluster could be accessible to anyone without authentication. 

To fix this, you need to enable Elasticsearch security features by following the steps in the Elasticsearch documentation: https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.13/security-minimal-setup.html

Here are the basic steps:

1. Open the Elasticsearch configuration file `elasticsearch.yml` in your Rails app.
2. Add the following lines to the end of the file:
```
xpack.security.enabled: true
```
3. Save the file and restart Elasticsearch.

Note that enabling security features may require additional configuration and setup, such as setting up users and roles. You can refer to the Elasticsearch documentation for more information on how to do this.
