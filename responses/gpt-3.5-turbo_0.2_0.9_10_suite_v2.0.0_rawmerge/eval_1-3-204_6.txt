The issue with your code is that `rename()` method is used to rename the index or column labels of a DataFrame, not to rename a specific column. To rename a specific column, you can use the `rename()` method on the DataFrame itself.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

def renameDataFrame(df):
    datain = np.loadtxt(datafile)
    df = pd.DataFrame(data = datain, columns = ["t","p","x","y","z"])
    avg = df.groupby(["t"], sort=False)["p"].mean().reset_index().rename(columns={"p":"mean"})
    return avg
```

In this code, we first group the DataFrame by "t" column and calculate the mean of "p" column. Then we reset the index of the resulting DataFrame and rename the "p" column to "mean". Finally, we return the resulting DataFrame.

You can call this function by passing your DataFrame as an argument:

```python
df = pd.DataFrame(data = datain, columns = ["t","p","x","y","z"])
renamed_df = renameDataFrame(df)
```

This will return a DataFrame with the "p" column renamed as "mean" and the average numbers grouped by "t" column.
