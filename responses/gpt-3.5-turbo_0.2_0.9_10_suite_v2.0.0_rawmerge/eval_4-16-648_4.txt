This error message indicates that the file system is mounted as read-only, which means that you cannot create new directories or modify existing files. 

To resolve this issue, you can try the following steps:

1. Check the file system's read/write status by running the following command in the terminal:

   ```
   mount | grep ' / '
   ```

   This will display the file system's mount options. If you see "ro" (read-only) in the output, then the file system is mounted as read-only.

2. Remount the file system as read-write by running the following command:

   ```
   sudo mount -uw /
   ```

   This will remount the file system as read-write.

3. Try creating the directory again:

   ```
   sudo mkdir /data/db
   ```

   This should create the directory without any issues.

If the above steps do not work, it's possible that there is an issue with the file system itself. In this case, you may need to run disk utility to repair the file system or reinstall the operating system.
