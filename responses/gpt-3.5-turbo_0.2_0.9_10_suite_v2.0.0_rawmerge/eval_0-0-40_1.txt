The error message you are receiving indicates that there is an issue with the npm executable file. It seems like the file has Windows line endings, which is causing the error when you try to run it in the Ubuntu terminal.

To fix this issue, you can try the following steps:

1. Open the terminal and navigate to the directory where the npm executable file is located. In your case, it is located in `/mnt/c/Program Files/nodejs/`.

```
cd /mnt/c/Program Files/nodejs/
```

2. Convert the file to Unix line endings using the `dos2unix` command.

```
sudo apt-get install dos2unix
sudo dos2unix npm
```

3. Make sure the npm file has executable permissions.

```
sudo chmod +x npm
```

4. Try running the `npm -v` command again.

```
npm -v
```

This should fix the issue and allow you to use npm in your Ubuntu terminal.
