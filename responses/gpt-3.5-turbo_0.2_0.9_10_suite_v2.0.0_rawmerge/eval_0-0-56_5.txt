It looks like the issue might be related to the way you are running the Vite server inside the Docker container. By default, Vite binds to `localhost` which means it will only accept connections from within the container itself. To allow connections from outside the container, you need to bind to `0.0.0.0` instead.

To do this, you can modify your `vite.config.ts` file like this:

```typescript
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import vue from '@vitejs/plugin-vue'

// https://vitejs.dev/config/
export default defineConfig({
    resolve: { alias: { '@': '/src' } },
    plugins: [vue()],
    server: {
        port: 8080,
        host: '0.0.0.0'
    }
})
```

This will tell Vite to bind to all available network interfaces, which should allow connections from outside the Docker container.

Once you've made this change, you can rebuild your Docker image and try running the container again. You should then be able to access the Vite server from your host machine using `localhost:8080`.
