The error message suggests that there is an issue with the message encryption in your Rails application. To fix this, you can try resetting your Rails application secret key base. Here are the steps:

1. Remove the `master.key` file:
```
rm config/master.key
```
2. Create a new `master.key` file:
```
EDITOR="mate --wait" bin/rails credentials:edit
```
This will open up your credentials file in your text editor. Save and close the file to generate a new `master.key` file.

3. Add the new `master.key` file to your git repository and commit the changes:
```
git add config/master.key
git commit -m "Regenerate master key"
```

4. Push the changes to Heroku:
```
git push heroku master
```

This should fix the message encryption issue and allow you to deploy your Rails application to Heroku successfully.
