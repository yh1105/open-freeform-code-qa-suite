The warning is caused by the fact that the `[]` operator on a `Map` returns a nullable value. To solve the warning, you can either change the type of the variable `s` to `String?` or use the null-aware operator `?` to check for nullability and assign the value to `s`. Here's an example of using the null-aware operator:

```dart
void foo(Map<int, String> myMap) {
  if (myMap.containsKey(1)) {
    String? s = myMap[1];
    s ??= ''; // assign an empty string if s is null
  }
}
```

Alternatively, you can change the type of `s` to `String?`:

```dart
void foo(Map<int, String> myMap) {
  if (myMap.containsKey(1)) {
    String? s = myMap[1];
  }
}
```

Note that changing the type to `String?` means that you will need to handle nullability when using `s` later in your code.
