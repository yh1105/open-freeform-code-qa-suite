When you set `"sourceMap": false` in your `tsconfig.json` file, the TypeScript compiler will no longer generate source map files for your TypeScript code. 

Source maps are files that map the compiled JavaScript code back to the original TypeScript code. They are used by the browser's developer tools to allow you to debug your TypeScript code directly in the browser.

If you set `"sourceMap": false`, the browser's developer tools will no longer be able to map the compiled JavaScript code back to the original TypeScript code. This means that you will not be able to debug your TypeScript code directly in the browser.

However, setting `"sourceMap": false` can have some benefits. It can reduce the size of your compiled JavaScript files, as the source map files can be quite large. It can also improve the performance of your application, as the browser does not need to load and parse the source map files.

In summary, setting `"sourceMap": false` can have some benefits, but it will also prevent you from debugging your TypeScript code directly in the browser.
