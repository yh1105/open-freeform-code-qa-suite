Here's the implementation of the `removeFalseSubjects` function in Java:

```java
public static void removeFalseSubjects(List<Subject> subjects) {
    subjects.removeIf(subject -> !subject.isStatus());
}
```

This function uses the `removeIf` method of the `List` interface to remove all elements from the list that do not have a `true` status. The `removeIf` method takes a `Predicate` as an argument, which is a functional interface that takes an object of the list's element type and returns a boolean value. In this case, the lambda expression `subject -> !subject.isStatus()` is used as the predicate, which returns `true` if the subject's status is `false`, and `false` otherwise.
