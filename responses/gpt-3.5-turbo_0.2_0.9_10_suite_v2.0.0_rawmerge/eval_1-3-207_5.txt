Sure, I can help you with that. You can calculate the end time by adding the duration to the starting time and then adjusting the hours and minutes accordingly. Here's the updated code with the calculation for hours:

```python
def computeEndTime(hour, mins, dura):
    mins = (mins + dura) % 60
    hour = (hour + (mins + dura) // 60) % 24
    return "{:02d}:{:02d}".format(hour, mins)
```

In this code, we first calculate the total number of minutes by adding the starting minutes and the duration. We then calculate the number of hours that need to be added to the starting hour by dividing the total minutes by 60 and taking the integer part. We add this to the starting hour and take the result modulo 24 to get the final hour. Finally, we format the result as a string with leading zeros for the hours and minutes.

You can call this function with the starting hour, minutes, and duration as arguments, like this:

```python
print(computeEndTime(12, 17, 59)) # Output: 13:16
```

This will print the end time in the format "xx:xx".
