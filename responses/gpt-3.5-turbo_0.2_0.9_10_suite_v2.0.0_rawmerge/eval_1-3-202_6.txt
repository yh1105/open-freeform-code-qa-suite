It seems like there is an issue with removing the `requests` and `setuptools` packages from the conda environment. One solution to this problem is to create a new conda environment and install the required packages in that environment. You can follow these steps to create a new environment:

1. Open the Anaconda prompt.
2. Type the following command to create a new environment:

   ```
   conda create --name myenv python=3.6
   ```

   Replace `myenv` with the name of your new environment.
3. Activate the new environment by typing:

   ```
   activate myenv
   ```

   Replace `myenv` with the name of your new environment.
4. Install the required packages in the new environment by typing:

   ```
   conda install --file python3.6-environment-windows.yml
   ```

   Replace `python3.6-environment-windows.yml` with the name of the file that contains the list of required packages.
5. Once the installation is complete, you can deactivate the environment by typing:

   ```
   deactivate
   ```

   This will return you to the base environment.

You can now use the new environment to work with the required packages.
