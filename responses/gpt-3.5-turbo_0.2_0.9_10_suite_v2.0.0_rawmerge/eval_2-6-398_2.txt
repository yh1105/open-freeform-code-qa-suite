You need to register the ILogger service in the service collection. You can do this by adding the following line to your service registration code:
```c#
var services = new ServiceCollection()
    .AddLogging(logging => logging.AddConsole())
    .AddTransient<MyClass>() // Add this line
    .BuildServiceProvider();
```
This will register `MyClass` with the service collection and allow the dependency injection system to resolve the `ILogger` dependency when creating an instance of `MyClass`.
