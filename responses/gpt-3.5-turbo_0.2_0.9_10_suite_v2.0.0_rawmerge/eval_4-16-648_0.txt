This error message indicates that the file system is mounted as read-only, which means that you cannot create new directories or modify existing ones. 

To resolve this issue, you can try the following steps:

1. Check the file system status by running the following command:

   ```
   mount | grep ' / '
   ```

   This will display the file system status for the root directory.

2. If the output shows that the file system is mounted as read-only, you can try remounting it as read-write by running the following command:

   ```
   sudo mount -uw /
   ```

   This will remount the file system as read-write.

3. Once the file system is remounted as read-write, you can try creating the directory again using the `sudo mkdir -p /data/db` command.

If the above steps do not work, you may need to check if there are any disk errors or file system corruption issues that need to be fixed.
