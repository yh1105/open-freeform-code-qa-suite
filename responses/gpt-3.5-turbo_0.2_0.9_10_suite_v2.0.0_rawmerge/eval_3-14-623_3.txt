This error message usually indicates that there is a problem with the Swift code in your project or one of the pods you are using. Here are some steps you can take to try to resolve the issue:

1. Clean the build folder: Go to Product > Clean Build Folder (or hold down the Option key while selecting Clean) to delete all the build artifacts and start fresh.

2. Check for any syntax errors: Look for any syntax errors in your Swift code or in the code of the pods you are using. Make sure that all the code is valid Swift syntax.

3. Check for any missing dependencies: Make sure that all the dependencies required by your project and the pods you are using are installed and up-to-date.

4. Check for any conflicting dependencies: Make sure that there are no conflicting dependencies between your project and the pods you are using. You can use the `pod dependency` command to check for any conflicts.

5. Try updating your version of CocoaPods: Sometimes updating to the latest version of CocoaPods can help resolve issues like this. You can update CocoaPods by running `sudo gem install cocoapods` in the Terminal.

6. Try updating your version of Swift: If you are using an older version of Swift, try updating to the latest version to see if that resolves the issue.

If none of these steps work, you may need to dig deeper into the error message to try to identify the root cause of the problem. You can try looking at the build log in Xcode to see if there are any more specific error messages that might give you a clue as to what is going wrong.
