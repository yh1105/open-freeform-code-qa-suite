The "CSRF token mismatch" error occurs when the CSRF token generated by the server does not match the one sent by the client. This could be due to a number of reasons, including:

1. Session configuration: Check if the session configuration on the host domain is the same as the one on your local environment. Ensure that the session driver, lifetime, and other settings are the same.

2. Cache configuration: Check if the cache configuration on the host domain is the same as the one on your local environment. Ensure that the cache driver, lifetime, and other settings are the same.

3. HTTPS: If your application is running on HTTPS, ensure that the SSL certificate is valid and properly configured. This is because the CSRF token is stored in a cookie, and cookies are not secure over HTTP.

4. Reverse proxy: If your application is behind a reverse proxy, ensure that the proxy is properly configured to pass the correct headers to your application.

5. Load balancer: If your application is running on multiple servers behind a load balancer, ensure that the load balancer is properly configured to route requests to the correct server.

6. Server time: Ensure that the server time on the host domain is correct. If the server time is incorrect, it can cause issues with session expiration and CSRF token validation.

7. Firewall: Check if there is a firewall on the host domain that is blocking requests or interfering with the session or cache storage.

In summary, check the session and cache configuration, HTTPS, reverse proxy, load balancer, server time, and firewall settings on the host domain to identify the issue.
