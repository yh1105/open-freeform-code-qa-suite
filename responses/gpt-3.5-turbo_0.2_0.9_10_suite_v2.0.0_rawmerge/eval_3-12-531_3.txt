The warning is due to the fact that the `[]` operator on a `Map` returns a nullable value. In this case, the value type of the `Map` is `String`, but the `[]` operator returns a `String?` which can be null. To solve the warning, you can either change the type of the variable `s` to `String?` or use the null-aware operator `!` to assert that the value is not null. Here's an example of using the null-aware operator:

```dart
void foo(Map<int, String> myMap) {
  if (myMap.containsKey(1)) {
    String s = myMap[1]!;
  }
}
```

By using the `!` operator, we are telling the Dart compiler that we are sure that the value returned by `myMap[1]` is not null.
