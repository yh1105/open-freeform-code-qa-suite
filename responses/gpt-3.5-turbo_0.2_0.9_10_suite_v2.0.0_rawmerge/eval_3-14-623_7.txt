This error can be caused by a variety of issues, but here are a few things you can try:

1. Clean your project: In Xcode, go to Product > Clean. Then try building your project again.

2. Delete derived data: In Xcode, go to Preferences > Locations and click on the arrow next to the Derived Data folder. Delete the contents of this folder and try building your project again.

3. Check for any missing or outdated dependencies: Make sure all of your dependencies are up to date and installed correctly. You can try running `pod install` again to make sure everything is installed correctly.

4. Check for any syntax errors: Make sure there are no syntax errors in your code. Sometimes a syntax error can cause the compiler to fail.

5. Try disabling "Parallelize Build": In Xcode, go to File > Project/Workspace Settings and uncheck "Parallelize Build". Then try building your project again.

Hopefully one of these solutions will help you resolve the issue.
