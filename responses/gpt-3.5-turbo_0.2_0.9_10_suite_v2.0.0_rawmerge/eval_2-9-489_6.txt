This warning is related to Elasticsearch's built-in security features not being enabled. Without authentication, your Elasticsearch cluster could be accessible to anyone. To fix this, you can enable Elasticsearch security by following these steps:

1. Open the Elasticsearch configuration file located at `config/elasticsearch.yml` in your Rails app.

2. Add the following lines to the file:

   ```
   xpack.security.enabled: true
   xpack.security.transport.ssl.enabled: true
   xpack.security.transport.ssl.verification_mode: certificate
   ```

3. Save the file and restart Elasticsearch.

   If you're using Elasticsearch as a service, you can restart it by running the following command in your terminal:

   ```
   brew services restart elasticsearch-full
   ```

   If you're running Elasticsearch manually, you can restart it by running the following command in your terminal:

   ```
   elasticsearch
   ```

After enabling Elasticsearch security, you may need to update your Searchkick configuration to include authentication credentials. You can do this by adding the following lines to your `config/initializers/searchkick.rb` file:

```
Searchkick.client_options = {
  user: "your-username",
  password: "your-password"
}
```

Replace `your-username` and `your-password` with your Elasticsearch authentication credentials.
