The issue with your script is that the variable `$searchT` is inside single quotes in the `grep` command, which means it is not being expanded. To fix this, you can use double quotes instead of single quotes. Here's the updated script:

```
#!/bin/bash
read -p "enter search term here: " searchT

if grep -wi "$searchT" test.txt; then     
    echo "$(grep "$searchT" test.txt | wc -l) number of matches found"
    grep "$searchT" test.txt

else 
    echo "no match found"    
fi

exit 0
```

In this updated script, we removed the `cat` command and used `grep` directly on the file. We also removed the single quotes around `$searchT` and used double quotes instead. Finally, we simplified the `echo` command to count the number of matches and display them in one line.
