Here's the Python code to solve the problem:

```python
def to_camel_case(text):
    if not text:
        return ""
    words = re.split(r'[-_]', text)
    return words[0] + ''.join(word.capitalize() for word in words[1:])
```

This function first checks if the input string is empty and returns an empty string if it is. It then splits the string using the regular expression `r'[-_]'` which matches either a dash or an underscore. The resulting list of words is then joined back together, with the first word left as is and the subsequent words capitalized using the `capitalize()` method. Finally, the joined string is returned.

You will also need to import the `re` module at the top of your code to use regular expressions.
