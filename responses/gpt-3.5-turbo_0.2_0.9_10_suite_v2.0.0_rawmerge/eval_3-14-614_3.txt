There could be a few reasons why the preview canvas is not showing in Xcode 11 beta when using Swift UI. Here are a few things you can try:

1. Make sure you are using Xcode 11 beta or later and have the latest version installed.

2. Check that you are in the canvas mode by clicking on the "Canvas" button in the top-right corner of the Xcode window.

3. Verify that you have imported the SwiftUI framework at the top of your file:

```
swift
import SwiftUI
```

4. Ensure that you have set the preview provider correctly. The code you provided looks correct, but make sure that the `ContentView` struct matches the name of your main view.

5. Try cleaning the build folder by going to "Product" > "Clean Build Folder" in the Xcode menu.

If none of these solutions work, try restarting Xcode or your computer. If the issue persists, you may want to file a bug report with Apple.
