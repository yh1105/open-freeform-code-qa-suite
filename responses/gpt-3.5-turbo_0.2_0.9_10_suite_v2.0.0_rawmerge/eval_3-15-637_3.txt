The error you are experiencing may be due to compatibility issues between the Selenium VBA library and Excel 2019. Here are some steps you can try to resolve the issue:

1. Make sure that the Selenium VBA library is properly installed and referenced in your Excel 2019 workbook. You can check this by going to the VBA editor and selecting Tools > References. Look for the Selenium Type Library and make sure it is checked.

2. Try using a different browser driver. For example, instead of using the Internet Explorer driver, try using the Chrome driver or Firefox driver. You can download these drivers from the Selenium website.

3. Check if there are any updates available for the Selenium VBA library. You can check for updates on the Selenium website or on the GitHub repository.

4. Try running the code on a different machine with Excel 2019 installed. This will help determine if the issue is specific to your machine or if it is a general compatibility issue.

5. If none of the above steps work, you may need to consider using a different automation tool that is compatible with Excel 2019.
