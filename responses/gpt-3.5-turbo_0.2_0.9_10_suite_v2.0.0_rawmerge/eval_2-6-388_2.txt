The `[Keyless]` attribute was introduced in Entity Framework Core 5.0. If you are using an earlier version of Entity Framework Core, you will not have access to this attribute.

To use `[Keyless]`, you need to make sure you have the following:

1. Entity Framework Core 5.0 or later installed in your project.
2. A reference to the `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore` namespace in your code.
3. A reference to the `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Relational` namespace in your code.

If you have all of these and are still not seeing the `[Keyless]` attribute, try updating your Entity Framework Core version to the latest version. You can do this by running the following command in the Package Manager Console:

```
Update-Package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore
```

If you are using .NET Core CLI, you can run the following command:

```
dotnet add package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore
```
