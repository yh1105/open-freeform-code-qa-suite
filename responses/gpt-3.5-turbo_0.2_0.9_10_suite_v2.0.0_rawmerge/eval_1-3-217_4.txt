You can use the PyTorch `torch.cat()` function to concatenate the two tensors along the last dimension. Here's the implementation of the `addTensor()` function:

```python
import torch

def addTensor(inps, d):
    # Reshape d to [64, 161, 1]
    d = d.unsqueeze(-1)
    # Concatenate inps and d along the last dimension
    out = torch.cat((inps, d), dim=-1)
    return out
```

Here, we first use the `unsqueeze()` function to add a new dimension to `d` along the last axis, so that its size becomes [64, 161, 1]. Then, we use the `torch.cat()` function to concatenate `inps` and `d` along the last dimension, resulting in a tensor of size [64, 161, 2].
