This error message indicates that the file system is mounted as read-only, which means that you cannot create new directories or modify existing files. 

To resolve this issue, you can try the following steps:

1. Check the file system status by running the following command:

   ```
   mount | grep ' / '
   ```

   This command will display the file system status for the root directory.

2. If the file system is mounted as read-only, you can remount it as read-write by running the following command:

   ```
   sudo mount -uw /
   ```

   This command will remount the root directory as read-write.

3. Now, you can try creating the directory again by running the following command:

   ```
   sudo mkdir -p /data/db
   ```

   This command should create the directory without any issues.

If the above steps do not work, you may need to check if there are any disk errors or file system corruption issues on your Mac. You can use the Disk Utility app to check and repair any disk errors.
