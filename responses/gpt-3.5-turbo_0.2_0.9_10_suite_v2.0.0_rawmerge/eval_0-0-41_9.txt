Your code looks correct. However, if the user denies permission to access their location, the `getCurrentPosition` method will not execute the success callback function and will instead execute the error callback function. Therefore, you need to add an error callback function to handle this case. Here's the revised code:

```javascript
if (navigator.geolocation) {
    navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(
        position => {
            console.log("Location accessed");
        },
        error => {
            console.log("User not allowed");
        }
    );
} else {
    console.log("Geolocation is not supported by this browser.");
}
```

This code will log "Location accessed" if the user allows access to their location, "User not allowed" if the user denies access to their location, and "Geolocation is not supported by this browser." if the browser does not support geolocation.
