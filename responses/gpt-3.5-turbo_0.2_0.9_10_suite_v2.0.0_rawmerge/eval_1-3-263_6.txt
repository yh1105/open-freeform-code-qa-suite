The `f` in `print(f"...")` stands for f-strings (formatted string literals). It is a feature introduced in Python 3.6 that allows you to embed expressions inside string literals, using curly braces `{}`. 

In the code you provided, the expressions inside the curly braces are `args.input_directory` and `args.output_directory`. These expressions are evaluated at runtime and their values are inserted into the string. 

For example, if `args.input_directory` is `"/path/to/input/directory"` and `args.output_directory` is `"/path/to/output/directory"`, the output of the `print` statements would be:

```
Input directory: /path/to/input/directory
Output directory: /path/to/output/directory
```

Using f-strings is a convenient way to format strings in Python, especially when you need to include variables or expressions in the string.
