Yes, you can convert your OpenSSH private key to an RSA private key using the `ssh-keygen` command. Here are the steps:

1. Open Terminal on your Mac.
2. Type the following command to convert your OpenSSH private key to an RSA private key:

   ```
   ssh-keygen -p -m PEM -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa
   ```

   This command will prompt you to enter a new passphrase for your private key. If you don't want to set a new passphrase, just press Enter.

3. After you enter the new passphrase (or press Enter), the command will convert your OpenSSH private key to an RSA private key and save it to `~/.ssh/id_rsa` (overwriting the existing file).

4. If you want to use the converted key to access a remote server, you will need to copy the new public key (`~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`) to the server's `authorized_keys` file. You can do this using the `ssh-copy-id` command:

   ```
   ssh-copy-id user@server
   ```

   Replace `user` with your username on the remote server, and `server` with the server's hostname or IP address.

   If you don't want to use `ssh-copy-id`, you can manually copy the contents of `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub` to the `authorized_keys` file on the remote server.

Note that converting your private key will not affect your public key (`id_rsa.pub`). You can continue to use the same public key to access remote servers.
