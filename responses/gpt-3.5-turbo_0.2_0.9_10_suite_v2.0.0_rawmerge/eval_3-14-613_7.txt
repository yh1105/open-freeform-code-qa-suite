It seems like the preview code is not associated with any target in the current scheme. Try adding the file containing the preview code to the target in your project. To do this, select the file in the Project navigator, go to the File inspector, and make sure the checkbox next to the target is checked. If the checkbox is disabled, try selecting a different target and then switching back to the original target.
