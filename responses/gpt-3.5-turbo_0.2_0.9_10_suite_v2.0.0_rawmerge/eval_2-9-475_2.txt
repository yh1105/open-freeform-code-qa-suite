You can try installing libffi using Homebrew, which is a package manager for macOS. Here are the steps:

1. Install Homebrew by running the following command in your terminal:

```
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

2. Once Homebrew is installed, run the following command to install libffi:

```
brew install libffi
```

3. After installing libffi, try running `gem install travis` again and it should work.
