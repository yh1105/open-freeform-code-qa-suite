```go
type A struct {
}

type B struct {
}

type AB interface {
    *A | *B
    some() bool
}

func (a *A) some() bool {
    return true
}

func (b *B) some() bool {
    return false
}

func some[T AB](x T) bool {
    return x.some()
}
```

In the `AB` interface, you need to define the `some()` method signature. This is because the `some()` method is not defined in the `A` or `B` structs, but rather in the `AB` interface. Therefore, you need to include it in the interface definition.

Also, note that the `|` operator is used to define a type union constraint, which means that `T` must be either `*A` or `*B`.
