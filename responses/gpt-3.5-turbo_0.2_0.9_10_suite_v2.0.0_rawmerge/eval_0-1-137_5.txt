The issue is that you are missing a comma after the color value for the "primary" key in your `$theme-colors` map. Here's the corrected code:

```scss
@import "../../node_modules/bootstrap/scss/variables";

$theme-colors: (
  "primary": #your-color-here,
);

@import "../../node_modules/bootstrap/scss/bootstrap";
```

Make sure to replace `#your-color-here` with the actual color value you want to use for the primary color.

Also, make sure that you are using a valid CSS color value. If you are using a named color, make sure it is spelled correctly. If you are using a hexadecimal color value, make sure it is in the correct format (e.g. `#ff0000` for red).
