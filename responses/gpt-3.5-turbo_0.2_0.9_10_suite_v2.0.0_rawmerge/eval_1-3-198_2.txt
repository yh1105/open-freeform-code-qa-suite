To read a CSV file from Google Drive, you need to modify the URL of the file. Here's how you can do it:

```python
def processURL(url):
    file_id = url.split('/')[-2]
    csv_url = f'https://drive.google.com/uc?id={file_id}&export=download'
    return csv_url
```

Explanation:

- `url.split('/')[-2]` extracts the file ID from the URL.
- `csv_url = f'https://drive.google.com/uc?id={file_id}&export=download'` creates a new URL with the file ID and the export parameter set to download, which allows you to download the file directly.
- The function returns the new URL.

You can then use this new URL to read the CSV file using pandas:

```python
import pandas as pd

url = 'https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B6GhBwm5vaB2ekdlZW5WZnppb28/view?usp=sharing'
csv_url = processURL(url)
df = pd.read_csv(csv_url)
```
