This error usually occurs when there is an issue with the build settings or when there is a problem with the script that is being executed during the build phase. Here are some steps you can try to resolve this issue:

1. Clean the project: Go to Product > Clean Build Folder and then try to build the project again.

2. Check build settings: Make sure that the build settings are correct. Check if there are any missing or incorrect settings.

3. Check script: Check the script that is being executed during the build phase. Make sure that it is correct and there are no errors.

4. Update pods: Try updating the pods to the latest version. Run `pod update` in the terminal.

5. Remove derived data: Delete the derived data folder and try building the project again.

6. Check for conflicting frameworks: Check if there are any conflicting frameworks that are causing the issue. Try removing them and then build the project again.

7. Check for missing files: Check if there are any missing files in the project. Add them and then try building the project again.

If none of the above steps work, try creating a new project and then adding the required libraries and files to it. This should resolve the issue.
