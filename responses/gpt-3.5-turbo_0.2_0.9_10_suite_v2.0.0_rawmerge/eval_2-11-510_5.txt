The header `<experimental/filesystem>` was introduced in C++17 as an experimental feature, and it was later standardized in C++17 as `<filesystem>`. Therefore, you should include the header `<filesystem>` instead of `<experimental/filesystem>`.

Replace the line `#include <experimental/filesystem>` with `#include <filesystem>` and change the namespace from `std::experimental::filesystem` to `std::filesystem`. 

Here is the updated code:

```c++
#include <filesystem>

int main(int argc, char** argv)
{
    std::string imageDirectory = "./image";;
    std::vector<std::string> imagePath;
    for (const auto& entry: std::filesystem::directory_iterator(imageDirectory))
    {
        imagePath.push_back(entry.path());
        std::cout << entry.path() << std::endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
``` 

Make sure to compile with the flag `-std=c++17` or higher to enable C++17 features.
