The error message is indicating that there is an issue with the argument being passed to the `profile` URL in your `index.html` template. Specifically, it seems that the `post.author.username` value is empty or `None`, which is causing the `NoReverseMatch` error.

To fix this issue, you can add a check to ensure that the `post.author` value is not `None` before trying to access its `username` attribute. You can do this by modifying the relevant line in your `index.html` template as follows:

```html
{% if post.author %}
    <a href="{% url 'profile' post.author.username %}">
        @{{post.author.username}}
    </a>
{% endif %}
```

This will only render the link if the `post.author` value is not `None`, which should prevent the `NoReverseMatch` error from occurring.
