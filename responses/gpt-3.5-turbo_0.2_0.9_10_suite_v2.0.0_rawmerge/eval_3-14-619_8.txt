The issue might be that `ContentView_Previews` is using `@State` instead of `@Binding` for `selected`. Try changing `@State` to `@Binding` in `ContentView_Previews` and pass in a `Bool` value to `selected` when previewing the view. For example:

```
struct ContentView_Previews: PreviewProvider {
    static var previews: some View {
        ContentView(isSelected: .constant(true))
    }
}
```
