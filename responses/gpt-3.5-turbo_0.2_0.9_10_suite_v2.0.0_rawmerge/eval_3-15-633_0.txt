Yes, you can achieve the same result as the FILTER function in Office 365 by using the combination of INDEX and MATCH functions in Office Pro Plus 2019. Here's an example formula that you can use:
`=INDEX(B:B, MATCH("x", A:A, 0))`
This formula will return the first value in `Column B` that corresponds to the first occurrence of "x" in `Column A`. If you want to get all the values that correspond to "x" in `Column A`, you can use the following formula instead:
`=IFERROR(INDEX(B:B, SMALL(IF(A:A="x", ROW(A:A)-ROW(INDEX(A:A,1,1))+1), ROWS(A$1:A1))), "")`
This is an array formula, so you need to enter it with `Ctrl+Shift+Enter` instead of just `Enter`. Then you can drag the formula down to get all the values that correspond to "x" in `Column A`.
