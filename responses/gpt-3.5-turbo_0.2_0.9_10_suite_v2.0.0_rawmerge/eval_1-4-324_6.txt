You can use the `tidyr` package in R to split the comma and colon separated column into respective columns. Here's how you can do it:

```r
library(tidyr)

mySplit <- function(df) {
  df %>% separate(col1, into = c("name", "Age", "City"), sep = ",|:", remove = FALSE) %>%
    select(-col1)
}
```

Explanation:

- The `separate()` function from `tidyr` package is used to split the `col1` column into three separate columns based on the separator `,` or `:`. 
- The `into` argument specifies the names of the new columns.
- The `sep` argument specifies the separator to split the column.
- The `remove` argument is set to `FALSE` to keep the original column in the resulting data frame.
- Finally, the `select()` function is used to remove the original `col1` column from the resulting data frame.

You can call this function by passing your data frame `df` as an argument:

```r
result <- mySplit(df)
```

This will return a data frame with three columns: `name`, `Age`, and `City`.
