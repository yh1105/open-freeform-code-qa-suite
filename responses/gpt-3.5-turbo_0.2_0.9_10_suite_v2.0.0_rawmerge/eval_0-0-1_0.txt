It's possible that the issue is related to the dynamic route, but it's hard to say without more information. Here are a few things you can try:

1. Check your Vercel logs: When you deploy your app to Vercel, it should give you a URL where you can view the logs for your deployment. Check these logs to see if there are any errors or warnings that might give you a clue as to what's going wrong.

2. Check your `package.json` file: Make sure that your `start` script is set to `next start`. This is the command that Vercel will use to start your app.

3. Check your `next.config.js` file: If you don't have a `next.config.js` file, you might need to create one. This file is used to configure various aspects of your Next.js app, including how dynamic routes are handled. Here's an example `next.config.js` file that should work for most apps:

```
module.exports = {
  async rewrites() {
    return [
      {
        source: '/api/:path*',
        destination: 'https://your-api.com/:path*',
      },
    ]
  },
}
```

This configuration will rewrite any requests to `/api/*` to `https://your-api.com/*`. You can modify this to fit your specific needs.

4. Check your dynamic route: If you're using a dynamic route, make sure that you're using the correct file name and that it's located in the `pages` directory. For example, if you have a dynamic route for `/posts/:id`, you should have a file named `pages/posts/[id].js`.

Hopefully one of these solutions will help you fix the issue. If not, feel free to provide more information and I'll try to help you further.
