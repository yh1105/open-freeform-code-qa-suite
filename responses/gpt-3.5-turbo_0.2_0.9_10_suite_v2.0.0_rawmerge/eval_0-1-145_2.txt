The `truncate` class in TailwindCSS only works if the element has a fixed width. You can add the `w-` class to set the width of the element. For example, you can add `w-40` to set the width to 40 pixels:

```html
<div class="ml-1 inline-block">
   <span>Label: </span>
   <span class="font-semibold truncate w-40">
     long texttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttt
   </span>
</div>
```

Alternatively, you can use the `max-w-` class to set the maximum width of the element. For example, you can add `max-w-xs` to set the maximum width to extra small:

```html
<div class="ml-1 inline-block">
   <span>Label: </span>
   <span class="font-semibold truncate max-w-xs">
     long texttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttt
   </span>
</div>
``` 

Choose the appropriate width or maximum width based on your design.
