This error occurs because Bootstrap 4 requires the Popper.js library to work properly. To fix this error, you need to install the Popper.js library using npm. 

You can install Popper.js by running the following command in your terminal:

```
npm install popper.js --save
```

After installing Popper.js, you need to import it in your JavaScript file before importing Bootstrap. You can do this by adding the following line of code:

```javascript
import Popper from 'popper.js';
```

Make sure to import Popper before importing Bootstrap. This should resolve the "Module not found :can't resolve popper.js" error.
