This error occurs when the integrity check of the downloaded package fails. Here are some possible measures to resolve the issue:

1. Clear the npm cache by running `npm cache clean --force` and then try running `npm install` again.

2. Delete the `node_modules` folder and `package-lock.json` file, then run `npm install` again.

3. Upgrade your npm version to the latest version by running `npm install -g npm@latest` and then try running `npm install` again.

4. If you are using a private registry, make sure that the registry is up and running and accessible from your server.

5. If none of the above solutions work, try deleting the `node_modules` folder, `package-lock.json` file, and `npm-shrinkwrap.json` file (if it exists), then run `npm cache clean --force` and `npm install` again.

If the issue persists, you can check the debug log mentioned in the error message for more information on the error.
