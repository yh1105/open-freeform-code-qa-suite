For the first issue, the "CSRF token mismatch" error could be caused by a few things. One possibility is that the server's clock is not synchronized with the client's clock, causing the token to expire before it should. Another possibility is that the session is not being properly maintained between requests, which could be caused by a misconfiguration of the session driver or storage.

For the second issue, the error message suggests that the SSL version being used by the server is not compatible with the version expected by the client. You may need to try a different encryption method, such as TLS, or check with the email provider to ensure that the correct encryption settings are being used. Additionally, make sure that the SMTP port being used is correct and not being blocked by any firewalls or security settings.
