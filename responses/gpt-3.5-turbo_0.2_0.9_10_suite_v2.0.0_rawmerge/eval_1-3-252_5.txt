You can use the `groupby` method to group the DataFrame by column A and then use the `idxmin` method to get the index of the minimum value in column B for each group. Finally, you can use the `loc` method to select the rows with those indices. Here's the code:

```python
def getMin(df):
    idx = df.groupby(['A'])['B'].idxmin()
    result = df.loc[idx]
    return result
```

This function first groups the DataFrame by column A and then applies the `idxmin` method to column B for each group. This returns a Series with the index of the minimum value in column B for each group. Then, the `loc` method is used to select the rows with those indices, which gives the desired result.
