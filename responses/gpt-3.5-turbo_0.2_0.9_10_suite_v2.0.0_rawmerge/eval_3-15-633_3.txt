Yes, you can achieve the same result as the FILTER function in Office 365 by using the combination of INDEX and MATCH functions. Here's an example formula that should work in Office Pro Plus 2019:
`=INDEX(B:B, MATCH("x", A:A, 0))`
This formula will return the value in `Column B` that is on the same row as the first occurrence of "x" in `Column A`. If there are multiple occurrences of "x" in `Column A`, it will return the value on the row of the first occurrence.
