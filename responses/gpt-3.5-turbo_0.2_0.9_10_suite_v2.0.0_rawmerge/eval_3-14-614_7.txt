There are a few things you can try to get the preview canvas to show up in Xcode 11 beta:

1. Make sure you have the latest version of Xcode 11 beta installed.
2. Check that you are running Xcode 11 beta on macOS Catalina beta.
3. Verify that you have selected the canvas mode by clicking the "Resume" button in the top left corner of the Xcode window.
4. Try cleaning the build folder by selecting "Product" from the menu bar, then "Clean Build Folder".
5. If none of the above works, try restarting Xcode or your computer.

If the issue persists, you can also try creating a new project and see if the preview canvas works there.
