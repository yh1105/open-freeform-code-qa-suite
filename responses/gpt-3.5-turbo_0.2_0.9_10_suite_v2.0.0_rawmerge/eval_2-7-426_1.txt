The "CSRF token mismatch" error occurs when the CSRF token generated by the server does not match the one sent by the client. This can happen if the session is not being maintained properly on the server-side.

Since you mentioned that multiple sessions are being generated for one user, it is possible that the session configuration on the host domain is causing the issue. Here are some things you can check:

1. Make sure that the session driver on the host domain is set to the same as the one on your local environment. If you are using the file driver locally, make sure it is also set to file on the host domain.

2. Check if the session cookie domain is set correctly. If it is set to a different domain than the one you are accessing the application from, it can cause issues with session management.

3. Check if the session cookie path is set correctly. If it is set to a different path than the one your application is running on, it can also cause issues with session management.

4. Check if the session encryption key is set correctly on the host domain. If it is different from the one on your local environment, it can cause issues with session decryption.

5. Check if the server clock on the host domain is set correctly. If the clock is off by a significant amount, it can cause issues with session expiration.

6. Check if there are any caching mechanisms in place on the host domain that might be interfering with session management.

Once you have checked these things, try running the application again and see if the issue persists. If it does, you may need to do some further debugging to identify the root cause of the issue.
