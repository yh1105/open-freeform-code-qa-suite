The `FormatException` occurs when the JSON string is not properly formatted. In your case, it seems that the response body is not a valid JSON string. 

To solve this issue, you can print the response body and check if it is a valid JSON string. If it is not, then you need to modify your PHP file to return a valid JSON string.

Here are some steps you can follow to debug and solve the issue:

1. Print the response body:

```dart
print(response.body);
```

2. Check if the response body is a valid JSON string. You can use an online JSON validator like [JSONLint](https://jsonlint.com/) to validate the JSON string.

3. Modify your PHP file to return a valid JSON string. Make sure that the response is in the following format:

```json
{
  "key1": "value1",
  "key2": "value2",
  "key3": "value3"
}
```

4. Once you have a valid JSON string, you can decode it using the `json.decode()` method:

```dart
var data = json.decode(response.body);
```

If you still face issues, please provide more details about the response body and the PHP file.
