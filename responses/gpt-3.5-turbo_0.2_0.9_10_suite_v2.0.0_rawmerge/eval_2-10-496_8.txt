You can use the `sort_by` method from the `Vec` type to sort a vector of structs by multiple fields. Here's an example of how you can sort your `my_vector` by `row` and then by `column`:

```rust
my_vector.sort_by(|a, b| {
    if a.row == b.row {
        a.column.cmp(&b.column)
    } else {
        a.row.cmp(&b.row)
    }
});
```

This code uses a closure to define the sorting criteria. The `sort_by` method will call this closure for each pair of elements in the vector and use the result to determine their order.

The closure first checks if the `row` field of the two elements is equal. If it is, it compares their `column` field using the `cmp` method. If the `row` field is different, it compares their `row` field instead.

After the `sort_by` method is called, `my_vector` will be sorted by `row` and then by `column`.
