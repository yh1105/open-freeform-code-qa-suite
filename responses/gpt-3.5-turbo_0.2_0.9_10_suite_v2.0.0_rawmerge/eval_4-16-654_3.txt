You can add your existing SSH key to Git Bash by following these steps:

1. Open Git Bash and navigate to your home directory by typing `cd ~`.
2. Create a new directory called `.ssh` by typing `mkdir .ssh`.
3. Move your SSH key to the `.ssh` directory by typing `mv /d/keys/id_rsa ~/.ssh/`.
4. Set the correct permissions for the SSH key by typing `chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_rsa`.

Your SSH key should now be added to Git Bash and ready to use.
