Yes, there is a simpler way to remove duplicate elements from an array in Rust. You can use the `dedup` method provided by Rust's standard library. Here's an example:

```rust
#[derive(Debug)]
struct Person {
    name: String,
    age: u32,
}

fn main() {
    let mut arr = [
        Person { name: "aaa".to_string(), age: 10 },
        Person { name: "bbb".to_string(), age: 20 },
        Person { name: "bbb".to_string(), age: 20 },
        Person { name: "ccc".to_string(), age: 30 },
    ];

    arr.sort_by_key(|p| p.name.clone());
    arr.dedup_by_key(|p| p.name.clone());

    dbg!(arr);
}
```

In this example, we first sort the array by the `name` field of the `Person` struct, and then use the `dedup_by_key` method to remove the duplicates. The `dedup_by_key` method removes consecutive elements that have the same key, so it's important to sort the array first.
