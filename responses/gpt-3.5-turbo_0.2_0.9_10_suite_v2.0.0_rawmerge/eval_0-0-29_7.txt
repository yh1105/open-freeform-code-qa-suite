To make sure the second query runs only after the first one is fulfilled, you can use the `useEffect` hook to watch for changes in the `userFulfilled` variable. Here's an example of how you can modify the second query code:

```javascript
const { data: userBio, isFulfilled: userBioFulfilled } = useGetUserBioQuery(user?.id);

useEffect(() => {
  if (userFulfilled) {
    // Only run the second query if the first one is fulfilled and user.id is available
    user?.id && refetch();
  }
}, [userFulfilled, user?.id]);
```

In this code, we're using the `useEffect` hook to watch for changes in the `userFulfilled` and `user?.id` variables. If `userFulfilled` is true and `user?.id` is available, we call the `refetch` function to run the second query with the `user.id` parameter.

Note that we're using optional chaining (`user?.id`) to make sure that the code doesn't break if `user` is not yet available.
