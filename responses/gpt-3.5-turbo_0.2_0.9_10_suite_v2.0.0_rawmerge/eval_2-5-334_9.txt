@Configuration should be used when you want to define beans using Java-based configuration instead of XML-based configuration. It is typically used to define beans that require more complex configuration or when you need to define multiple beans in a single class. @Service, @Controller, and @Component are used to define beans that are annotated with specific stereotypes and are typically used for simpler bean definitions.
