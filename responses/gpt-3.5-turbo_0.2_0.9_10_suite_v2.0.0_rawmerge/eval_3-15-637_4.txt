The error you are encountering might be due to the incompatibility of the Selenium WebDriver with Excel 2019. Here are some suggestions to try and resolve the issue:

1. Make sure that you have the latest version of the Selenium WebDriver installed. You can download it from the official Selenium website.

2. Try using a different browser, such as Firefox or Chrome, to see if the issue persists.

3. Check if the reference to the Selenium WebDriver is correctly set in the VBA editor. To do this, go to Tools > References and make sure that the Selenium Type Library is checked.

4. Try running the code in compatibility mode for Excel 2013. To do this, right-click on the Excel icon and select Properties > Compatibility. Check the box for "Run this program in compatibility mode for" and select Excel 2013 from the drop-down menu.

5. If none of the above solutions work, you can try using a different automation tool, such as AutoIt or WinAutomation, to automate your tasks. These tools are compatible with Excel 2019 and can be used to automate web browsers as well.
