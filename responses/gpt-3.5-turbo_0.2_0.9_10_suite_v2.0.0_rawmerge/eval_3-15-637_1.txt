The error you are encountering may be due to a compatibility issue between the Selenium VBA library and Excel 2019. Here are a few things you can try to resolve the issue:

1. Make sure that you have the latest version of the Selenium VBA library installed. You can download it from the official Selenium website.

2. Check that the reference to the Selenium library is correctly set in the VBA editor. To do this, go to Tools > References and make sure that the checkbox next to "Selenium Type Library" is checked.

3. Try running the code in a different browser, such as Chrome or Firefox, to see if the issue is specific to Internet Explorer.

4. If none of the above solutions work, you may need to downgrade to an earlier version of Excel that is compatible with the Selenium VBA library.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
