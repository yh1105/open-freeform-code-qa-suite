In Rust, the caret operator (`^`) is not used for exponentiation. Instead, you can use the `pow` method from the `num` crate. Here's an example:

```rust
use num::pow;

fn main() {
    let base = 2;
    let exponent = 3;
    let result = pow(base, exponent);
    println!("{} raised to the power of {} is {}", base, exponent, result);
}
```

This will output:

```
2 raised to the power of 3 is 8
```

Alternatively, you can use the `powi` method from the standard library's `std::ops::Pow` trait. Here's an example:

```rust
fn main() {
    let base = 2;
    let exponent = 3;
    let result = base.pow(exponent);
    println!("{} raised to the power of {} is {}", base, exponent, result);
}
```

This will output the same result as the previous example.
