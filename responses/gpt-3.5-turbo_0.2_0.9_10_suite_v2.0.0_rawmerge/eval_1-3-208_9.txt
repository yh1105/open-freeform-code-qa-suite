The issue with your code is that you are checking if the entire input string is in the `correct` string, which is not what you want. Instead, you should check if all characters in the input string are in the `correct` string. Here's the corrected code:

```python
import string

def checkString(text):
    correct = string.ascii_letters + string.digits
    return all(char in correct for char in text)

text = input("Enter: ")
if checkString(text):
    print("Success")
else:
    print("Failure")
```

In this code, the `checkString` function takes a string `text` as input and returns `True` if all characters in the string are either letters or digits, and `False` otherwise. The `all` function is used to check if the condition holds for all characters in the string.

You can call this function with any string to check if it satisfies the requirement.
