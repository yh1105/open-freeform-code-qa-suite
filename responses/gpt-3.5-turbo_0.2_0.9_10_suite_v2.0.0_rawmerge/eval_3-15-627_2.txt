You can create a calendar input in VBA Excel without using any external ocx files by creating a userform with a calendar control. You can add a calendar control to the userform by selecting "Microsoft Date and Time Picker Control" from the "Additional Controls" option in the "Developer" tab. Then, you can add code to display the userform and retrieve the selected date from the calendar control.
