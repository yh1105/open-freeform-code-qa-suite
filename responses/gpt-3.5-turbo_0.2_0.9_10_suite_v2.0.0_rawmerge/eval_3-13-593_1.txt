To add Jetpack Compose to an existing Android Studio project, you need to make sure that your project is using Android Gradle plugin version 7.0.0 or higher. Then, you can add the following dependencies to your app-level build.gradle file:

```
dependencies {
    implementation 'androidx.compose.ui:ui:1.0.0'
    implementation 'androidx.compose.material:material:1.0.0'
    implementation 'androidx.compose.ui:ui-tooling:1.0.0'
}
```

After adding these dependencies, you can start using Jetpack Compose in your project. Keep in mind that you may need to update your code to use Compose instead of traditional Android views.
