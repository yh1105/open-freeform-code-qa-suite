You can calculate the end time by first adding the duration to the starting time in minutes, and then converting the total minutes back to hours and minutes.

Here's the updated code with the missing calculation:

```python
def computeEndTime(hour, mins, dura):
    total_mins = hour * 60 + mins + dura
    end_hour = total_mins // 60
    end_mins = total_mins % 60
    return f"{end_hour:02d}:{end_mins:02d}"

# Example usage
print(computeEndTime(12, 17, 59)) # Output: 13:16
```

In the `computeEndTime` function, we first calculate the total number of minutes by adding the starting time in minutes (`hour * 60 + mins`) to the duration (`dura`). 

Then, we calculate the end hour by dividing the total minutes by 60 (`total_mins // 60`), and the end minutes by taking the remainder of the total minutes divided by 60 (`total_mins % 60`).

Finally, we format the end time as a string with the desired format using f-strings. The `:02d` format specifier ensures that the hour and minute values are zero-padded to two digits.
