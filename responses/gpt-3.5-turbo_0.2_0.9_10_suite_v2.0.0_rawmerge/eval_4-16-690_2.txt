Starting from macOS Catalina 10.15, the default shell has been changed from Bash to Zsh. Therefore, the `~/.bash_profile` file will not be sourced by default.

To set environment variables in Zsh, you need to add them to the `~/.zshrc` file instead. So, you can add the following line to `~/.zshrc`:

```
export JBOSS_HOME=/Users/{USERNAME}/Desktop/jboss7
```

Then, save the file and run the following command to apply the changes:

```
source ~/.zshrc
```

Now, you should be able to access the `JBOSS_HOME` environment variable in your terminal.
