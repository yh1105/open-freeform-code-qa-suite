In Rust, the caret operator (`^`) is not used for exponentiation. Instead, you can use the `pow` method that is available on the `num::Integer` trait. Here's an example:

```rust
use num::Integer;

fn main() {
    let base = 2;
    let exponent = 3;
    let result = base.pow(exponent);
    println!("{} raised to the power of {} is {}", base, exponent, result);
}
```

This will output:

```
2 raised to the power of 3 is 8
```

Note that the `pow` method returns a `BigInt` type, which can represent arbitrarily large integers. If you want to convert the result to a primitive integer type, you can use the `to_*` methods that are available on the `num::traits::ToPrimitive` trait. For example, to convert the result to a `u64`, you can do:

```rust
use num::Integer;
use num::traits::ToPrimitive;

fn main() {
    let base = 2;
    let exponent = 63;
    let result = base.pow(exponent);
    let result_u64 = result.to_u64().unwrap();
    println!("{} raised to the power of {} is {}", base, exponent, result_u64);
}
```

This will output:

```
2 raised to the power of 63 is 9223372036854775808
```
