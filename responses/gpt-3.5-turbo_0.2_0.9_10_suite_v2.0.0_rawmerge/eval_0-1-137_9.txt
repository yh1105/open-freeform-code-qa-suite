The issue with your code is that you are missing the `#` symbol before the color value in your `$theme-colors` map. The `to-rgb` function in Bootstrap's `_functions.scss` file expects a color value in the format of `#RRGGBB` or `#RGB`, but your map is missing the `#` symbol.

To fix this issue, you need to add the `#` symbol before each color value in your `$theme-colors` map. Here's the revised code:

```scss
@import "../../node_modules/bootstrap/scss/variables";

$theme-colors: (
  "primary": #0d6efd,
);

@import "../../node_modules/bootstrap/scss/bootstrap";
```

With this code, you should be able to compile your SCSS file without any errors.
