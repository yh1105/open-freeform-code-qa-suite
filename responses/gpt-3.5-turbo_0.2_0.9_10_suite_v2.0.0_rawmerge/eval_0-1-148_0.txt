Yes, Tailwind CSS has first and last pseudo-class variants that can be used to target the first and last elements of a list. Here's how you can modify your code to add a border-bottom to all the `li` elements except the last one:

```html
<ul>
  <li
    v-for="(item, index) in items"
    :key="`item-${index}`"
    class="border-solid border-b border-black {{ index === items.length - 1 ? '' : 'pb-4' }}"
  >
    Item
  </li>
</ul>
```

In the above code, we have added a conditional class `pb-4` to all the `li` elements except the last one. `pb-4` adds a padding-bottom of 1rem to the element, which will create a space between the border-bottom of the current `li` element and the top of the next `li` element. 

The conditional class is added using the ternary operator, which checks if the current element is the last element in the `items` array. If it is the last element, an empty string is added as the class, which means no padding will be added. If it is not the last element, `pb-4` is added as the class, which will add the required padding.
