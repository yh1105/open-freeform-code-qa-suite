Sure, I can help you with that. Here's a function that should do what you're looking for:

```python
import openpyxl

def filterExcelRows(filePath, matchedString):
    wb = openpyxl.load_workbook(filePath)
    sheet = wb['Sheet1']
    rows = []
    for row in sheet.iter_rows():
        for cell in row:
            if cell.value == matchedString:
                rows.append(row)
                break
    return rows
```

This function loads the Excel file specified by `filePath`, and then iterates over all the cells in the sheet named `Sheet1`. If a cell contains the string specified by `matchedString`, the entire row is added to the `rows` list. Finally, the function returns the `rows` list.

You can then call this function like this:

```python
rows = filterExcelRows('example.xlsx', 'ABC')
```

This will return a list of rows that contain the string 'ABC'. You can then access the contents of each cell in each row using the `value` attribute of each cell. For example, to get the value of the first cell in the first row, you would use `rows[0][0].value`.
