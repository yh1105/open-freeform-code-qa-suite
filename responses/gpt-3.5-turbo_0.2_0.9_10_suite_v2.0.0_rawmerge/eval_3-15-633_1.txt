You can achieve the same result as the FILTER function in Office 365 by using the combination of INDEX and MATCH functions. Here's an example formula that should work in Office Pro Plus 2019:

`=INDEX(B:B, MATCH("x", A:A, 0))`

This formula will return the value in `Column B` that corresponds to the first occurrence of "x" in `Column A`. If you want to return all the values in `Column B` that match "x" in `Column A`, you can use the following formula:

`=IFERROR(INDEX(B:B, SMALL(IF(A:A="x", ROW(A:A)-ROW(INDEX(A:A,1,1))+1), ROWS(A$1:A1))), "")`

This is an array formula, so you need to enter it with `Ctrl+Shift+Enter`. This formula will return all the values in `Column B` that match "x" in `Column A`, separated by a comma. If there are no matches, it will return an empty string.
