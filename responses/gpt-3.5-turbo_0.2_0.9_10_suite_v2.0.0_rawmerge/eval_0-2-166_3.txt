TailwindCSS is a utility-first CSS framework and does not provide a way to select direct children of an element. However, you can achieve this by using the `@layer` directive to define your own custom CSS rules.

Here's an example of how you can define a custom rule to select direct children of an element with class `section`:

```css
@layer components {
  .section > * {
    /* Your styles here */
  }
}
```

This will select all direct children of an element with class `section` and apply the styles you define within the curly braces. You can then use this class in your HTML like this:

```html
<div class="section">
  <div>Direct child 1</div>
  <div>Direct child 2</div>
</div>
```

Note that this approach requires you to define your own custom CSS rules, which may not be as flexible as using standard CSS selectors.
