You can use the `conda list --show-channel-urls` command to display the size of each package in your conda environment. 

Here's how to do it:

1. Open the Anaconda Prompt or your terminal.
2. Type `conda list --show-channel-urls` and press Enter.
3. Wait for the list of packages to be displayed.
4. Look for the `size` column in the output. This column shows the size of each package in bytes.

You can sort the packages by size by adding the `--reverse-sort` option to the command. This will display the largest packages at the top of the list.

For example, the command `conda list --show-channel-urls --reverse-sort` will display the packages sorted by size, with the largest packages at the top of the list.
