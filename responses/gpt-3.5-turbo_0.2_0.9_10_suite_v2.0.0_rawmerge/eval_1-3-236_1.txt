If the `"python.linting.jediEnabled": false` line is greyed out in your settings.json file, it means that it is being overridden by another setting. 

To fix this issue, you can try the following steps:

1. Open your VS Code settings by pressing `Ctrl + ,` or by going to `File > Preferences > Settings`.
2. Search for "python.linting.enabled" and make sure it is set to `true`.
3. Search for "python.languageServer" and make sure it is set to `"Pylance"`.
4. Search for "python.analysis.disabled" and make sure it is set to `["unresolved-import"]`.
5. Search for "python.linting.jediEnabled" and make sure it is set to `false`.
6. Save your settings and restart VS Code.

If the issue persists, you can try disabling the Jedi extension by going to the Extensions panel, searching for "Jedi" and clicking on the "Disable" button.
