It sounds like you might be missing some configuration in your Next.js app that is causing the 404 error when deployed to Vercel. Here are some steps you can take to troubleshoot the issue:

1. Check your Vercel deployment logs: When you deploy your app to Vercel, it will generate logs that can help you identify the source of the issue. You can access these logs by going to your Vercel dashboard and clicking on the deployment that failed. Look for any error messages or warnings that might indicate what went wrong.

2. Check your `package.json` file: Make sure that your `package.json` file has the correct scripts for building and running your app. Specifically, make sure that you have a `build` script that runs the `next build` command and a `start` script that runs the `next start` command.

3. Check your `next.config.js` file: If you have any custom configuration for your Next.js app, make sure that it is included in a `next.config.js` file in the root of your project. This file should export an object with any custom configuration options you need.

4. Check your dynamic routes: If you have any dynamic routes in your app, make sure that they are defined correctly. Dynamic routes in Next.js are defined using square brackets, like `[id].js`. Make sure that your dynamic routes are defined correctly and that they are being handled correctly in your code.

5. Check your API routes: If you have any API routes in your app, make sure that they are defined correctly and that they are being handled correctly in your code. API routes in Next.js are defined in a `pages/api` directory and should export a function that handles the API request.

If none of these steps help you identify the issue, you might want to consider creating a Next.js config file and configuring your app for deployment to Vercel. This will give you more control over your app's configuration and can help you identify and fix any issues that might be causing the 404 error.
