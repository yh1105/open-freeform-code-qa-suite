The error message indicates that ESLint is unable to find the `tsconfig.json` file. This is because the `tsconfig.json` file is located in the root directory of your project, and the `.eslintrc.js` file is located in the `src` directory.

To fix this issue, you need to update the `parserOptions.project` property in the `.eslintrc.js` file to point to the correct location of the `tsconfig.json` file. You can do this by updating the `parserOptions` property as follows:

```javascript
parserOptions: {
  project: "../tsconfig.json",
  sourceType: "module",
},
```

This assumes that the `tsconfig.json` file is located in the parent directory of the `src` directory. If it is located elsewhere, you will need to update the path accordingly.

Once you have made this change, save the `.eslintrc.js` file and restart VSCode. The error message should disappear, and the red squiggly lines should go away.
