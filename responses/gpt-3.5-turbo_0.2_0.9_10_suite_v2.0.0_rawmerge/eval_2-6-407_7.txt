The error message suggests that the response from the server is not in the expected JSON format. It looks like the response starts with a '<' character, which indicates that it might be an HTML error page instead of a JSON response.

To troubleshoot this issue, you can try the following steps:

1. Check the network tab in your browser's developer tools to see the response from the server. Make sure it is a valid JSON response and not an HTML error page.

2. Check the URL in the `Http.GetJsonAsync` method to make sure it is correct and matches the route in your API controller.

3. Try using a tool like Postman to send a GET request to the API endpoint and see if it returns a valid JSON response.

4. If the response is not a valid JSON, check the server-side code to make sure it is returning the correct data in the correct format.

5. If you are still unable to resolve the issue, try simplifying your code and removing any unnecessary complexity to isolate the problem.

Here's an example of how you can rewrite the code to handle the response as a string instead of JSON:

```c#
var response = await Http.GetAsync("/api/Employee/Index");
if (response.IsSuccessStatusCode)
{
    var content = await response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();
    // Parse the content as JSON or handle it as a string
}
else
{
    // Handle the error
}
```

This code sends a GET request to the API endpoint and reads the response as a string. You can then parse the string as JSON or handle it as a string depending on your requirements.
