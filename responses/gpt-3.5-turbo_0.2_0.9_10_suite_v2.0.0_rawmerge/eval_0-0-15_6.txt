To mock a class with Jest, you need to return a constructor function that creates an instance of the class. Here's the revised code that should eliminate the error:

```javascript
import API from 'utils/API';

jest.mock('utils/API', () => {
  return jest.fn().mockImplementation(() => {
    return {
      someMethod: jest.fn()
    };
  });
});

const api = new API();
```

In this code, we're returning a Jest mock function that returns an object with a `someMethod` function. The `jest.fn()` creates a mock function that we can use to verify that `someMethod` is called correctly. The `mockImplementation` method sets up the mock function to return the object with `someMethod`. Finally, we're creating a new instance of the mocked `API` class with `const api = new API();`.
