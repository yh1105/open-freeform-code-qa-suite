When you run the container with `docker run IMAGE_NAME`, it does not execute the `.bashrc` file because it is not an interactive shell. To source the `.bashrc` file, you can modify your `launch.sh` script to source it before running the `node` command. You can add the following line to your `launch.sh` script:

```
source /root/.bashrc
```

This will source the `.bashrc` file and make the `node` command available.
