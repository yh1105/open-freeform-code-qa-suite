In Safari, when an image is in a nested flexbox element with a width set and height: auto it may not work as expected. One solution is to add `align-items: flex-start;` to the parent flex container. This will align the items to the start of the cross axis, which will allow the image to maintain its aspect ratio and not be stretched.

```css
.container {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  align-items: flex-start; /* add this */
}

.container section:first-child {
  display: flex;
  margin-bottom: 25px;
}

.container img {
  width: 125px;
  height: auto;
}
```

```html
<div class="container">
  <section>
    <img src="https://via.placeholder.com/250">
  </section>
  <section>
    <img src="https://via.placeholder.com/150">
  </section>
</div>
```
