When you run the container with `docker run IMAGE_NAME`, the `.bashrc` file is not sourced because the default shell used by Docker is `/bin/sh`, not `/bin/bash`. To source `.bashrc`, you can modify your `launch.sh` script to source it explicitly before running your commands:

```
#!/bin/bash

source /root/.bashrc
cd /workspace/demo
npm install
node index.js
``` 

This will ensure that the `nvm` script is loaded and available for use in your container.
