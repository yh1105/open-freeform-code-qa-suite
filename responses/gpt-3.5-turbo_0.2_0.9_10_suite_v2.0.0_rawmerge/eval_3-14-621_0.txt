The error occurs because you are trying to access the `@State` variable outside of the `body` of the `View`. In SwiftUI, the `@State` variables can only be accessed and modified within the `body` of the `View`.

To initialize the `@State` variable with a value from outside the `body`, you can use a `@Binding` variable instead. Here's an updated version of your code that uses a `@Binding` variable:

```
struct StateFromOutside: View {
    let list = [
        "a": "Letter A",
        "b": "Letter B",
        // ...
    ]
    @Binding var fullText: String

    init(letter: String, fullText: Binding<String>) {
        self._fullText = fullText
        self.fullText = list[letter]!
    }

    var body: some View {
        TextField("", text: $fullText)
    }
}
```

You can then use this `View` like this:

```
struct ContentView: View {
    @State var text = ""

    var body: some View {
        StateFromOutside(letter: "a", fullText: $text)
    }
}
```

This will initialize the `text` variable with the value of `"Letter A"` from the `list` dictionary.
