With Font Awesome 5, the syntax for using icons in CSS has changed. You need to use the `font-family` property with the value `"Font Awesome 5 Free"` or `"Font Awesome 5 Pro"` instead of `"FontAwesome"`. Also, the content value should be the Unicode value of the icon instead of the icon class name.

Here's the updated code:

```css
#mainNav .navbar-collapse .navbar-sidenav .nav-link-collapse:after {
  float: right;
  content: "\f107";
  font-family: "Font Awesome 5 Free";
}
```

Note that you need to make sure that the Font Awesome 5 font files are properly included in your project and that the font-family value matches the font files you are using.
