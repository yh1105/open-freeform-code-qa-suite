The error message you are getting indicates that there is a problem with the npm executable. It seems like the file has Windows line endings, which is causing the issue.

To fix this, you can try the following steps:

1. Open the file `/mnt/c/Program Files/nodejs/npm` in a text editor that supports Unix-style line endings (such as Notepad++ or Visual Studio Code).

2. In the text editor, go to the "Edit" menu and select "EOL Conversion" (or a similar option).

3. Choose "Unix (LF)" as the line ending format.

4. Save the file and exit the text editor.

5. Try running the `npm -v` command again.

If the above steps do not work, you can try reinstalling npm using the following command:

```
sudo apt-get install -y npm
```

This should install the latest version of npm and set it up correctly.
