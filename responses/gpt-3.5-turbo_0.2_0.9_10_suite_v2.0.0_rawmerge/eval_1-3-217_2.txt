You can use the PyTorch `torch.cat()` function to concatenate the two tensors along the last dimension. Here's the implementation of the `addTensor()` function:

```python
import torch

def addTensor(inps, d):
    # Reshape d to match the shape of inps
    d = d.unsqueeze(-1)
    # Concatenate inps and d along the last dimension
    out = torch.cat([inps, d], dim=-1)
    return out
```

Here, we first unsqueeze the `d` tensor along the last dimension to match the shape of `inps`. Then, we use the `torch.cat()` function to concatenate the two tensors along the last dimension, which results in a new tensor with a shape of [64, 161, 2].
