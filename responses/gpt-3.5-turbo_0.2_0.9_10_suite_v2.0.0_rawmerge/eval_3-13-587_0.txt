This issue is caused by the incompatibility between Jacoco 0.8.6 and Kotlin 1.5.10. To fix this issue, you can try upgrading Jacoco to version 0.8.7 or higher. 

To upgrade Jacoco, change the `toolVersion` in your `build.gradle` file to:
```
jacoco {
    toolVersion = "0.8.7"
}
```

If upgrading Jacoco doesn't work, you can try downgrading Kotlin to version 1.5.0 or lower. 

To downgrade Kotlin, change the `kotlin_version` in your `build.gradle` file to:
```
kotlin_version = "1.5.0"
```

After making these changes, run the test coverage report task again and it should work without any issues.
