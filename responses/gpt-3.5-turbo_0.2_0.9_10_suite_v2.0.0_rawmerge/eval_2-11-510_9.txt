The `<experimental/filesystem>` header was introduced in C++17 as an experimental feature. In C++17, the `<experimental/filesystem>` header was part of the experimental namespace, but in C++20, it was moved to the std namespace.

To fix the error, you need to add the following line at the beginning of your code to indicate that you are using the std namespace:

```c++
using namespace std;
```

Alternatively, you can use the std::experimental::filesystem namespace instead of std::filesystem:

```c++
#include <experimental/filesystem>

int main(int argc, char** argv)
{
    std::string imageDirectory = "./image";;
    std::vector<std::string> imagePath;
    for (const auto& entry: std::experimental::filesystem::directory_iterator(imageDirectory))
    {
        imagePath.push_back(entry.path());
        std::cout << entry.path() << std::endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
```

Note that you need to link the filesystem library when compiling your code. In GCC, you can do this by adding the `-lstdc++fs` flag to your compile command:

```bash
g++ main.cpp -lstdc++fs -o main
```
