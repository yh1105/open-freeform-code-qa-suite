The error message indicates that Python is not installed on your machine or it is not in the PATH environment variable. 

To fix this issue, you need to install Python and add it to the PATH environment variable. Here are the steps to follow:

1. Download and install Python from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

2. During the installation process, make sure to check the option "Add Python to PATH".

3. After the installation is complete, open a new command prompt and type `python --version` to verify that Python is installed and in the PATH.

4. If you still get an error, you may need to add the Python installation directory to the PATH environment variable manually. To do this, follow these steps:

   a. Open the Control Panel and go to System and Security > System > Advanced system settings.

   b. Click on the "Environment Variables" button.

   c. Under "System Variables", scroll down and find the "Path" variable. Click on "Edit".

   d. Click on "New" and add the path to the Python installation directory (e.g. C:\Python27).

   e. Click "OK" to close all windows.

5. Try running the build again and it should work now.
