You can use the `WorkbookConnection` object in VBA to automate Power Query. Here's an example code that loads data from a query to a worksheet:

```
Sub LoadDataFromQuery()
    Dim conn As WorkbookConnection
    Dim cmd As CommandText
    Dim rng As Range
    
    ' Get the connection for the query
    Set conn = ThisWorkbook.Connections("Query - Sales Data")
    
    ' Get the command text for the query
    Set cmd = conn.OLEDBConnection.CommandText
    
    ' Get the range where the data should be loaded
    Set rng = ThisWorkbook.Worksheets("Sheet2").Range("A1")
    
    ' Load the data from the query to the range
    cmd.Refresh BackgroundQuery:=False
    cmd.ResultRange.Copy rng
End Sub
```

Replace "Query - Sales Data" with the name of your query connection, and "Sheet2" with the name of the worksheet where you want to load the data.
