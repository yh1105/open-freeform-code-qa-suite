This error usually occurs when there is a problem with the Swift compiler. Here are some steps you can try to resolve the issue:

1. Clean the project: Go to Product > Clean in Xcode or use the shortcut Command + Shift + K. Then try building the project again.

2. Clean the build folder: Go to Product > Clean Build Folder or hold down the Option key while selecting Product > Clean. Then try building the project again.

3. Delete derived data: Go to Xcode Preferences > Locations and click on the arrow next to the Derived Data folder. Then delete the folder for your project. This will force Xcode to rebuild the project from scratch.

4. Check for any syntax errors in your code: Sometimes, syntax errors can cause the Swift compiler to fail. Check your code for any errors and fix them.

5. Check for any outdated pods: Make sure all the pods in your project are up to date. You can do this by running `pod outdated` in the terminal and updating any outdated pods.

6. Try updating Swift: If none of the above steps work, try updating Swift to the latest version. You can do this by going to Xcode Preferences > Components and clicking on the Install button next to the Swift version you want to install.

Hopefully, one of these steps will resolve the issue for you.
