The issue is that you are trying to access the `@State` variable outside of the `body` property of the `View`. Instead of initializing the `fullText` variable in the `init()` method, you can use a computed property to achieve the same result. Here's an updated version of your code:

```
struct StateFromOutside: View {
    let list = [
        "a": "Letter A",
        "b": "Letter B",
        // ...
    ]
    let letter: String
    @State private var fullText: String = ""

    private var initialText: String {
        list[letter] ?? ""
    }

    init(letter: String) {
        self.letter = letter
    }

    var body: some View {
        TextField("Enter text", text: $fullText)
            .onAppear {
                self.fullText = self.initialText
            }
    }
}
```

In this version, we've added a computed property called `initialText` that returns the value from the dictionary based on the `letter` parameter. We've also added an `onAppear` modifier to the `TextField` that sets the value of `fullText` to `initialText` when the view appears. This ensures that the `@State` variable is only accessed within the `body` property of the `View`.
