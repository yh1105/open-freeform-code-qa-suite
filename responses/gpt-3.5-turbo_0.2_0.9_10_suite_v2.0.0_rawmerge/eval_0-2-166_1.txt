TailwindCSS is a utility-first CSS framework that provides pre-defined classes for common CSS properties. It does not provide a way to select direct children of an element using a class selector.

However, you can achieve this by using a combination of classes. You can add a custom class to the parent div with class "section" and use the child combinator selector `>` in your CSS to select the direct children of that div.

For example, you can add a class "my-section" to the div with class "section" like this:

```html
<div class="section my-section">
  <div>Direct child 1</div>
  <div>Direct child 2</div>
</div>
```

And then use the following CSS to select the direct children of the div with class "my-section":

```css
.my-section > div {
  /* Your styles here */
}
```

This will select all direct children of the div with class "my-section" and apply the styles you define.
