If the `"python.linting.jediEnabled": false` line is greyed out, it means that it is being overridden by another setting. 

To find out which setting is overriding it, you can try the following steps:

1. Open the Command Palette by pressing `Ctrl+Shift+P` (Windows, Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+P` (macOS).
2. Type "Preferences: Open User Settings" and select it.
3. In the search bar, type "jediEnabled" to filter the settings.
4. Look for any settings that have "jediEnabled" set to `true`. These settings may be overriding your `"python.linting.jediEnabled": false` setting.
5. If you find any conflicting settings, either remove them or set them to `false`.

If you still can't get rid of the Jedi error messages, you can try disabling the Jedi language server by adding the following line to your settings.json file:

```
"python.jediEnabled": false
```

This should completely disable Jedi and prevent it from interfering with your linter.
