The error message is indicating that the `profile` URL pattern is not able to match the argument passed to it. Looking at your code, the issue is with the `author` field in the `NewPost` model. You have set `null=True` which means that the `author` field can be null. However, in your `index` view, you are not checking if the `author` field is null before passing it to the `profile` URL. 

To fix this, you can add a check in your `index` view to only display posts where the `author` field is not null. Here's an updated version of your `index` view:

```python
def index(request):
    if request.method == "POST":
        form = NewPostForm(request.POST)
        if form.is_valid():
            title = form.cleaned_data['title']
            description = form.cleaned_data['description']
            author = request.user

            post = NewPost(title=title, description=description, author=author)
            post.save()
            return HttpResponseRedirect(reverse("index"))
        else:
            return render(request, "network/index.html", {
                "form": form
            })

    # Only display posts where the author field is not null
    posts = NewPost.objects.exclude(author=None)

    return render(request, "network/index.html", {
        "form": NewPostForm(),
        "posts": posts
    })
```

This should fix the error you are seeing.
