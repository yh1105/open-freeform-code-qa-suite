To make sure the second query runs only after the first one is fulfilled, you can use the `useEffect` hook to watch for changes in the `userFulfilled` variable. Here's an example of how you can modify the second query code:

```javascript
const { data: userBio, isFulfilled: userBioFulfilled } = useGetUserBioQuery(user?.id);

useEffect(() => {
  if (userFulfilled) {
    // Only run the second query if the first one is fulfilled and user.id is available
    userBioFulfilled || refetch(); // refetch() is a function provided by useGetUserBioQuery
  }
}, [userFulfilled, user?.id, userBioFulfilled, refetch]);
```

This code uses the `useEffect` hook to watch for changes in `userFulfilled`, `user?.id` (the optional chaining operator is used to avoid errors if `user` is undefined), `userBioFulfilled`, and `refetch` (a function provided by `useGetUserBioQuery` to refetch the query). If `userFulfilled` is true, it checks if `userBioFulfilled` is also true (meaning the second query has already been fulfilled), and if not, it calls `refetch()` to run the second query.
