The `ext-zip` package is not a regular package that can be installed via Composer. It is actually a PHP extension that needs to be installed on your system.

To install the `ext-zip` extension, you need to follow these steps:

1. Check if the extension is already installed by running the following command in your terminal:

   ```
   php -m | grep zip
   ```

   If the extension is already installed, you should see `zip` in the output.

2. If the extension is not installed, you need to install it. The method for doing this depends on your operating system.

   For example, on Ubuntu, you can install the extension by running the following command:

   ```
   sudo apt-get install php-zip
   ```

   On macOS, you can install the extension using Homebrew:

   ```
   brew install php@7.4-zip
   ```

   Note that the package name may be different depending on your PHP version.

3. Once the extension is installed, restart your web server and try running the `composer require ext-zip` command again. It should now work without any issues.
