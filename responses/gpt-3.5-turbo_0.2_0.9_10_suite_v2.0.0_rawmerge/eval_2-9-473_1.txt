The error message suggests that there is an issue with the encryption of messages in your Rails application. To fix this, you can try resetting your Rails application's secret key base. Here are the steps:

1. Remove the `master.key` and `credentials.yml.enc` files:
```
rm config/master.key config/credentials.yml.enc
```
2. Create a new `master.key` file:
```
EDITOR="mate --wait" bin/rails credentials:edit
```
This will open up a text editor where you can add your new credentials. Save and close the editor to generate a new `master.key` file.
3. Re-encrypt your credentials:
```
bin/rails credentials:edit
```
This will open up the text editor again. Save and close the editor to re-encrypt your credentials with the new `master.key` file.
4. Commit the changes and push to Heroku:
```
git add config/master.key config/credentials.yml.enc
git commit -m "Reset secret key base"
git push heroku master
```
This should fix the encryption issue and allow you to deploy your Rails application to Heroku.
