Using `@Autowired` on the constructor is a recommended practice in Spring. It makes the code more readable and easier to understand the dependencies of a class. It also ensures that the required dependencies are available at the time of object creation. Additionally, it helps in writing unit tests as it makes it easier to mock dependencies. However, if you prefer to use constructor injection without `@Autowired`, it is also a valid approach.
