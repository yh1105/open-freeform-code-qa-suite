The issue you are facing might be due to the compatibility of the Selenium WebDriver with Excel 2019. Here are a few things you can try:

1. Make sure that you have the latest version of Selenium WebDriver installed. You can download it from the official Selenium website.

2. Check if the reference to the Selenium Type Library is properly set. To do this, go to the VBA editor, click on Tools > References, and make sure that the reference to the Selenium Type Library is checked.

3. Try using a different browser driver. For example, instead of using the Internet Explorer driver, try using the Chrome driver or the Firefox driver.

4. Try running the code in compatibility mode. To do this, go to the Excel 2019 shortcut, right-click on it, and select Properties. In the Properties window, go to the Compatibility tab and check the box that says "Run this program in compatibility mode for" and select Excel 2013 from the dropdown list.

5. If none of the above solutions work, try uninstalling and reinstalling Excel 2019 and the Selenium WebDriver.

I hope one of these solutions works for you. Let me know if you have any further questions or concerns.
