In Rust, a `Box` cannot be null. Instead, it can be empty, which means it doesn't point to any value. You can check if a `Box` is empty by using the `is_none` method. Here's an example:

```rust
struct Node {
    value: i32,
    next: Option<Box<Node>>,
}

struct Stack {
    top: Option<Box<Node>>,
}

fn main() {
    let mut stack = Stack { top: None };
    if stack.top.is_none() {
        println!("Stack is empty");
    }
}
```

In this example, the `next` field in the `Node` struct is changed to an `Option<Box<Node>>`. This allows the field to be empty. The `top` field in the `Stack` struct is also changed to an `Option<Box<Node>>`. In the `main` function, we check if `stack.top` is empty using the `is_none` method.
