This error occurs because the libffi6 library is missing on your system. You can fix this issue by installing the libffi6 library using the following command:

```
sudo apt-get install libffi6
```

After installing the library, try running the rails command again. If the issue persists, you may need to reinstall the ffi gem by running the following command:

```
gem uninstall ffi
gem install ffi
```

This should resolve the issue and allow you to use the rails command again.
