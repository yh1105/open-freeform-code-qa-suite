This error message indicates that the file system is mounted as read-only, which means that you cannot create new directories or modify existing ones. 

To resolve this issue, you can try the following steps:

1. Check the file system permissions: Run the command `mount` to see if the file system is mounted as read-only. If it is, you can try remounting it as read-write using the command `sudo mount -uw /`.

2. Check the disk for errors: Run the command `diskutil verifyVolume /` to check the disk for errors. If errors are found, you can try repairing them using the command `diskutil repairVolume /`.

3. Check the disk space: Make sure that you have enough disk space to create the new directory. You can check the available disk space using the command `df -h`.

4. Check for any other issues: If none of the above steps work, you can try restarting your computer or checking for any other issues that may be causing the problem.

Once you have resolved the issue, you should be able to create the new directory using the `sudo mkdir /data/db` command.
