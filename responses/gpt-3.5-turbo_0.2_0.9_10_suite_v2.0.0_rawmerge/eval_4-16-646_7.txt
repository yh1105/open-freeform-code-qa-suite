This error occurs because pdftk is a 32-bit application and Catalina only supports 64-bit applications. One solution is to use an alternative tool such as PDFsam or QPDF. However, if you still want to use pdftk, you can try the following steps:

1. Install Homebrew if you haven't already. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:

```
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)"
```

2. Install pdftk using Homebrew by running the following command:

```
brew install https://raw.githubusercontent.com/turforlag/homebrew-cervezas/master/pdftk.rb
```

3. If you still get the same error, try running pdftk using Rosetta. To do this, right-click on the pdftk application in Finder and select "Get Info". Check the box next to "Open using Rosetta" and then try running pdftk again.

Hopefully, one of these solutions will work for you.
