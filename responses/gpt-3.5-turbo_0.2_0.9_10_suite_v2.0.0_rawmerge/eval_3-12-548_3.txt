To disable the back button in Flutter when the user has reached the login page after logging out, you can use the `WillPopScope` widget. Wrap your login page with `WillPopScope` and set the `onWillPop` property to return a `Future.value(false)` to prevent the user from going back. Here's an example:

```
WillPopScope(
  onWillPop: () => Future.value(false),
  child: LoginPage(),
)
```

This will disable the back button on Android and prevent the user from swiping back on iOS. It's important to note that this approach should only be used on the login page after the user has logged out. In all other cases, the back button should be enabled to provide a good user experience.

Use `WillPopScope` instead of `Navigator.pop(context)` or `Navigator.of(context).pop()`.
