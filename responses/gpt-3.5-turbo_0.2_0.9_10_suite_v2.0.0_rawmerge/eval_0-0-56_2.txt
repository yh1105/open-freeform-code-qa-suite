It seems that the issue is with the way you are running the Vite server inside the Docker container. By default, Vite binds to `localhost` which means it can only be accessed from within the container itself. To make it accessible from outside the container, you need to bind it to `0.0.0.0` which will allow it to listen to all network interfaces.

To do this, you can modify your `vite.config.ts` file as follows:

```typescript
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import vue from '@vitejs/plugin-vue'

// https://vitejs.dev/config/
export default defineConfig({
    resolve: { alias: { '@': '/src' } },
    plugins: [vue()],
    server: {
        port: 8080,
        host: '0.0.0.0' // add this line
    }
})
```

This will make the Vite server accessible from outside the container. You can then run the container with the following command:

```bash
docker-compose run --publish 8080:8080 --rm app npm run vite
```

This should allow you to access the Vite server from your host machine using `localhost:8080`.
