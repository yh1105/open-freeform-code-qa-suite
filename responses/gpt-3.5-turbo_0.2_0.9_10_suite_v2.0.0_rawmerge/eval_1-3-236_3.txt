If the `"python.linting.jediEnabled": false` line is greyed out, it means that it is being overridden by another setting. To find out which setting is overriding it, you can follow these steps:

1. Open the Command Palette by pressing `Ctrl+Shift+P` (Windows, Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+P` (macOS).
2. Type "Preferences: Open User Settings" and select it.
3. In the search bar at the top, type "jediEnabled".
4. Look for any settings that have "jediEnabled" set to true. These settings could be in the "User" or "Workspace" sections.
5. Change the value of any settings that have "jediEnabled" set to true to false.

Once you have made these changes, save the settings file and restart Visual Studio Code. This should disable Jedi and prevent it from interfering with Pylint.
