The `<experimental/filesystem>` header was introduced in C++17 as an experimental feature. In C++17, the `std::experimental::filesystem` namespace was used to access the filesystem library. However, in C++17, the `<filesystem>` header was added to the standard library, and the `std::filesystem` namespace was introduced to replace the `std::experimental::filesystem` namespace.

To fix the error, you need to replace `std::experimental::filesystem` with `std::filesystem` in your code. Here's the updated code:

```c++
#include <filesystem>

int main(int argc, char** argv)
{
    std::string imageDirectory = "./image";;
    std::vector<std::string> imagePath;
    for (const auto& entry: std::filesystem::directory_iterator(imageDirectory))
    {
        imagePath.push_back(entry.path());
        std::cout << entry.path() << std::endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
```

Make sure that you are using a C++17 compliant compiler that supports the `<filesystem>` header.
