You can use the `sort_by` method on the `Vec` to sort by multiple fields. Here's an example of how you can sort `my_vector` by `row` and then by `column`:

```rust
my_vector.sort_by(|a, b| {
    if a.row == b.row {
        a.column.cmp(&b.column)
    } else {
        a.row.cmp(&b.row)
    }
});
```

This closure passed to `sort_by` compares two elements of the `Vec` at a time. It first compares the `row` fields of the two elements. If they are equal, it compares the `column` fields. The `cmp` method is used to compare the fields, which returns an `Ordering` value that tells `sort_by` how to order the elements.

After the `sort_by` method is called, `my_vector` will be sorted by `row` and then by `column`.
