It seems like IntelliJ IDEA is still using the old version of Java (1.8) to compile your code. You need to configure IntelliJ IDEA to use the new JDK 11.

Here are the steps to configure IntelliJ IDEA to use JDK 11:

1. Go to `File > Project Structure > SDKs`.
2. Click the `+` button to add a new SDK.
3. Select `JDK`.
4. Navigate to the directory where you installed JDK 11 (`C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-11.0.1`).
5. Click `OK` to add the new SDK.
6. Go to `File > Project Structure > Project`.
7. Under `Project SDK`, select the newly added JDK 11.
8. Click `OK` to save the changes.

After these steps, IntelliJ IDEA should be using JDK 11 to compile your code.
