This error message usually indicates that there is a problem with the Swift code in your project. Here are some steps you can take to try and resolve the issue:

1. Clean your project: Go to Product > Clean Build Folder in Xcode. This will delete all the intermediate build files and force Xcode to rebuild everything from scratch.

2. Update your pods: Make sure you have the latest version of all your pods installed. You can do this by running `pod update` in your project directory.

3. Check for syntax errors: Look for any syntax errors in your Swift code. Xcode should highlight any errors in red. Fix any errors you find and try building again.

4. Check for missing dependencies: Make sure all the dependencies your project relies on are installed and up-to-date. You can check this by running `pod install` in your project directory.

5. Check for conflicting dependencies: Sometimes, different pods may have conflicting dependencies. You can try removing some of the pods and see if that resolves the issue.

6. Check your build settings: Make sure your build settings are correct. Go to Project > Build Settings in Xcode and check that all the settings are correct for your project.

If none of these steps work, you may need to seek further assistance or contact the developers of the pods you are using for support.
