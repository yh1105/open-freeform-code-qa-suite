The error message is indicating that ESLint is unable to find the `tsconfig.json` file. This is because the `tsconfig.json` file is located in the `src` folder, which is included in the `include` array in the `tsconfig.json` file. However, the `.eslintrc.js` file is located in the root directory of the project, so it cannot find the `tsconfig.json` file.

To fix this issue, you need to update the `parserOptions` object in the `.eslintrc.js` file to include the path to the `tsconfig.json` file relative to the location of the `.eslintrc.js` file. In your case, you can update the `parserOptions` object as follows:

```javascript
parserOptions: {
  project: "./src/tsconfig.json",
  sourceType: "module",
},
```

This assumes that the `tsconfig.json` file is located in the `src` folder and that the `.eslintrc.js` file is located in the root directory of the project.

After making this change, you should restart VSCode to ensure that the changes are applied. The error message should disappear, and you should no longer see the red line in your `.ts` files.
