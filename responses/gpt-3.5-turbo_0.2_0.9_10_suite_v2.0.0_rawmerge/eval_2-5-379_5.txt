In Java 8, you can use the `getClass()` method to get the class of an object. Here's an example:

```java
Object obj = "Hello";
Class<?> clazz = obj.getClass();
System.out.println(clazz.getName()); // prints "java.lang.String"
```

This will give you the class of the object, which you can then compare to other classes using the `equals()` method. For example:

```java
Object obj = "Hello";
if (obj.getClass().equals(String.class)) {
    System.out.println("obj is a String");
}
```

Note that this approach works for both primitive types and objects. For example:

```java
int i = 42;
if (i.getClass().equals(Integer.class)) {
    System.out.println("i is an Integer");
}
```

However, this approach is not as concise as the `typeof` operator in JavaScript.
