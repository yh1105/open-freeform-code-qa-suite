The `truncate` class in TailwindCSS only works if the element has a fixed width or a max-width set. You can add the `max-w-xs` class to the `span` element to limit its width and make the `truncate` class work as expected.

Here's the updated code:

```html
<div class="ml-1 inline-block">
   <span>Label: </span>
   <span class="font-semibold truncate max-w-xs">
     long texttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttt
   </span>
</div>
```

This will limit the width of the `span` element to `xs` breakpoint (320px by default) and add ellipsis to the text if it overflows. You can adjust the `max-w-xs` class to fit your design needs.
