Your `sed` command is not correctly removing the `?` and everything after it. Try using the `tr` command instead to remove everything after the `?`:

```
find . -type f -name '*\?*' -exec sh -c 'mv "$1" "${1%\?*}"' _ {} \;
```

This should remove the `?` and everything after it from all filenames that match the pattern `*\?*`.
