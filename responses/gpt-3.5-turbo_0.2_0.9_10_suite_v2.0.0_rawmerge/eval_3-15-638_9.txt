It seems that you need to properly identify the object name and type to select it with the SelectByID2 method. One solution could be to create reference points on the selected face and edge to identify them. Another option could be to use one of the appropriate Selection methods to create reference points, since their names are known, and then use those for the SelectByID2 method. You mentioned that you will post the solution once you are done, so I suggest trying these approaches and seeing which one works best for you.
