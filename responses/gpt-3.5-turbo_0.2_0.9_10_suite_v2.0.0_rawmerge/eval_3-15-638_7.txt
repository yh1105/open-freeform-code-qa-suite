It seems that you need to properly identify the object name and type to select it using the SelectByID2 method. One way to do this is to create reference points using appropriate selection methods, as their names are known and can be used for SelectByID2. Another option is to use the GetFaces/GetFirstFace/GetNextFace methods to obtain the face object and then select it using SelectByID2.
