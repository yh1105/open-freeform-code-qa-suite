This error occurs because the latest version of Devise (4.8.0) is not compatible with Rails 4.2. To fix this error, you can either upgrade your Rails version to 5 or higher or downgrade your Devise version to a version that is compatible with Rails 4.2.

To downgrade your Devise version, you can specify the version number in your Gemfile and run `bundle install`. For example, to use Devise version 4.7.3, add the following line to your Gemfile:

```
gem 'devise', '4.7.3'
```

Then run `bundle install` to install the specified version of Devise.

Alternatively, you can upgrade your Rails version to 5 or higher, which will be compatible with the latest version of Devise. To upgrade your Rails version, you can follow the instructions in the Rails upgrade guide: https://guides.rubyonrails.org/upgrading_ruby_on_rails.html
