You can disable the automatic ordering of includes in clang-format by adding the following line to your `.clang-format` file:

```
SortIncludes: false
```

This will disable the sorting of includes, and they will be left in the order that they appear in your source code.

If you don't have a `.clang-format` file in your project, you can create one in the root directory of your project and add the above line to it.

Note that disabling the sorting of includes may cause some warnings or errors to appear when building your project, especially if you are using third-party libraries that require a specific include order. In this case, it's recommended to follow the recommended include order to avoid any issues.
