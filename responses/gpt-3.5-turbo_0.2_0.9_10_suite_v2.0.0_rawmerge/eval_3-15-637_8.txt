The error message "Automation Error" usually indicates a problem with the installation or registration of a DLL file. In this case, it could be related to the Selenium WebDriver DLL file not being registered properly on the new machine.

Here are some steps you can try to resolve the issue:

1. Make sure that the Selenium WebDriver add-in is installed and enabled in Excel 2019. You can check this by going to File > Options > Add-ins and looking for the Selenium add-in in the list.

2. Check that the correct version of the Selenium WebDriver DLL file is registered on the new machine. You can do this by opening a command prompt and running the following command:

   ```
   regsvr32 path\to\Selenium.WebDriver.dll
   ```

   Replace "path\to" with the actual path to the DLL file on your machine. If the registration is successful, you should see a message saying "DllRegisterServer in path\to\Selenium.WebDriver.dll succeeded."

3. Try running the code with a different browser driver, such as Chrome or Firefox, to see if the issue is specific to Internet Explorer.

4. If none of the above steps work, try uninstalling and reinstalling the Selenium WebDriver add-in and the browser drivers.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
