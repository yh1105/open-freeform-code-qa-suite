The error message you are receiving suggests that there is an issue with the `concat()` function in Pandas. This is likely due to a version incompatibility between Pandas and pandas-profiling.

To solve this issue, you can try downgrading your Pandas version to a compatible version. You can do this by running the following command in your Anaconda prompt:

```
conda install pandas=0.25.3
```

This will install Pandas version 0.25.3, which is known to be compatible with pandas-profiling.

Once you have downgraded your Pandas version, try running your code again:

```python
import pandas_profiling
from pandas_profiling import ProfileReport

profile = ProfileReport(data)
```

This should now work without any errors.

Alternatively, you can try updating pandas-profiling to the latest version, which should also be compatible with the latest version of Pandas. You can do this by running the following command in your Anaconda prompt:

```
pip install pandas-profiling --upgrade
```

Once you have updated pandas-profiling, try running your code again:

```python
import pandas_profiling
from pandas_profiling import ProfileReport

profile = ProfileReport(data)
```

This should now work without any errors.
