The error message suggests that you cannot set the body fields of a request with content-type "application/json". This means that you need to convert the body data to JSON format before sending it in the request.

To fix this, you can convert the body data to JSON using the `jsonEncode` method from the `dart:convert` library. Here's an updated version of your code:

```dart
import 'dart:convert';

Map<String,String> headers = {'Content-Type':'application/json','authorization':'Basic c3R1ZHlkb3RlOnN0dWR5ZG90ZTEyMw=='};

var response = await post(Urls.getToken,
        headers: headers,
        body: jsonEncode({"grant_type":"password","username":"******","password":"*****","scope":"offline_access"}),
      );
```

This should fix the error and allow you to receive data from the server.
