This error occurs because pdftk is a 32-bit application and Catalina only supports 64-bit applications. Here are some possible solutions:

1. Use an alternative tool: Since pdftk is no longer supported on Catalina, you can use an alternative tool such as PDFsam or QPDF.

2. Use a virtual machine: You can install a virtual machine on your Mac and run an older version of MacOS that supports 32-bit applications. This will allow you to use pdftk without any issues.

3. Use Homebrew: You can install pdftk using Homebrew, which is a package manager for MacOS. Open Terminal and run the following commands:

```
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)"
brew install pdftk-java
```

This will install pdftk-java, which is a Java-based version of pdftk that works on Catalina.

4. Use Docker: You can use Docker to run pdftk in a container. This will allow you to use pdftk without any issues on Catalina. Here is an example command to run pdftk in a Docker container:

```
docker run -v /path/to/pdf/files:/pdf pdftk pdftk /pdf/input.pdf output /pdf/output.pdf
```

Replace `/path/to/pdf/files` with the path to your PDF files. This will mount the directory as a volume inside the container and allow pdftk to access the files.
