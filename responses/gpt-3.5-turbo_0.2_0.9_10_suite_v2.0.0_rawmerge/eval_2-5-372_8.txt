It seems that there is a conflict between the version of Hibernate Validator that is included in your project and the one that is provided by JBoss. 

You can try to exclude the JBoss provided version of Hibernate Validator by adding the following exclusion to your pom.xml:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-validation</artifactId>
    <exclusions>
        <exclusion>
            <groupId>org.hibernate.validator</groupId>
            <artifactId>hibernate-validator</artifactId>
        </exclusion>
    </exclusions>
</dependency>
```

Then, you can add the desired version of Hibernate Validator as a direct dependency:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.hibernate.validator</groupId>
    <artifactId>hibernate-validator</artifactId>
    <version>6.0.11.Final</version>
</dependency>
```

This should resolve the conflict and allow you to use the @NotEmpty and @NotBlank annotations as expected.
