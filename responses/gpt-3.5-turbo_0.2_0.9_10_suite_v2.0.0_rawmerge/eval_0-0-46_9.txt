The error message indicates that ESLint is unable to read the `tsconfig.json` file. This is because the `tsconfig.json` file is not in the root directory of the project. 

To fix this issue, you need to update the `parserOptions.project` property in the `.eslintrc.js` file to point to the correct location of the `tsconfig.json` file. 

Assuming that the `tsconfig.json` file is located in the `functions` directory, you can update the `parserOptions.project` property as follows:

```javascript
parserOptions: {
  project: "./functions/tsconfig.json",
  sourceType: "module",
},
```

This should resolve the error and allow ESLint to read the `tsconfig.json` file.
