You can enable Dev Tools in IntelliJ 2021.2 by adding the following dependency to your Maven pom.xml file:

```
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-devtools</artifactId>
    <optional>true</optional>
</dependency>
```

Then, you can configure IntelliJ to automatically reload changes by going to "Settings" > "Build, Execution, Deployment" > "Compiler" and checking the "Build project automatically" option.

Finally, you can run your application in IntelliJ using the "Run" button or by pressing Shift+F10. Any changes you make to your code will be automatically reloaded by Dev Tools without having to restart the Tomcat server.
