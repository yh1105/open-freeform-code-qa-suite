The warning is caused by the fact that the `[]` operator of a `Map` returns a nullable value, meaning it can be either a non-null value of the specified type or `null`. In this case, the type of `myMap[1]` is `String?`, which cannot be directly assigned to a non-nullable `String` variable.

To solve the warning, you can either change the type of the variable `s` to `String?`, or use the null-aware operator `?.` to check if the value is not null before assigning it to `s`. Here are two possible solutions:

Solution 1: Change the type of `s` to `String?`
```dart
void foo(Map<int, String> myMap) {
  if (myMap.containsKey(1)) {
    String? s = myMap[1];
  }
}
```

Solution 2: Use the null-aware operator `?.`
```dart
void foo(Map<int, String> myMap) {
  if (myMap.containsKey(1)) {
    String? s = myMap[1];
    s?.toLowerCase(); // Example of using the null-aware operator
  }
}
```

Note that using the null-aware operator `?.` can be useful when you want to perform an operation on the value only if it is not null.
