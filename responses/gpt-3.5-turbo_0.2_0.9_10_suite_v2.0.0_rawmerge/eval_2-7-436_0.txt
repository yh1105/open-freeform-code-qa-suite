The error message suggests that your current PHP version, PHP extensions, and Composer version are not compatible with Laravel 9. 

Laravel 9 requires PHP 8.0 or higher, and some PHP extensions such as OpenSSL, PDO, Mbstring, Tokenizer, and XML. 

To fix the issue, you can try the following steps:

1. Check your current PHP version by running `php -v` in your terminal. If your PHP version is lower than 8.0, you need to upgrade your PHP version.

2. Check if the required PHP extensions are installed by running `php -m` in your terminal. If any of the required extensions are missing, you need to install them.

3. Check your Composer version by running `composer -V` in your terminal. If your Composer version is lower than 2.1, you need to upgrade your Composer version.

After completing the above steps, try running the `composer create-project laravel/laravel blog "9.*"` command again. It should work without any issues.
