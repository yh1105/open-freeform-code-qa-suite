Yes, you can use the `group-hover` variant in Tailwind CSS to achieve this effect. Here's an example code snippet:

```html
<a href="#" class="group text-sky-600 relative inline-block">
  Link
  <span class="absolute bottom-0 left-0 w-full h-0.5 bg-sky-600 transition-all group-hover:h-full"></span>
</a>
```

In this code, we are using the `group` class to group the link and the span element together. We also added the `relative` class to the link element to make the span element position itself relative to the link element.

The span element is positioned absolutely at the bottom left corner of the link element. We set its initial height to 0.5rem and its background color to `bg-sky-600`.

To create the animation effect, we use the `transition-all` class to specify that all CSS properties should be transitioned. We also use the `group-hover` variant to specify that the span element should have a height of `h-full` (i.e., the full height of the link element) when the link element is hovered over.

This should create the desired animation effect when the link element is hovered over.
