The error message `404 Not Found: aws-sdk-js@latest` suggests that the package `aws-sdk-js` could not be found in the npm registry. This could be due to a temporary issue with the registry or a problem with your internet connection.

You can try the following steps to resolve the issue:

1. Check your internet connection and try again.
2. Clear the npm cache by running `npm cache clean --force` and then try again.
3. Use a different npm registry by running `npm config set registry https://registry.npmjs.org/` and then try again.
4. Try installing a different package to see if the issue is specific to `aws-sdk-js`.

If none of these steps work, you can try again later or contact the npm support team for further assistance.
