Yes, there is a better way to do this. You can use the `?` operator to simplify the code and make it more readable. Here's how you can refactor the code:

```rust
if let Some(i) = func1() {
    if let Some(j) = func2(i)? {
        if let Some(k) = func3(j)? {
            let result = func4(k)?;
            // Do something with result
        } else {
            println!("func 3 returned None");
        }
    } else {
        println!("func 2 returned None");
    }
} else {
    println!("func 1 returned None");
}
```

This code uses the `?` operator to propagate errors up the call stack. If any of the functions `func1`, `func2`, `func3`, or `func4` return `None`, the code will jump to the appropriate error handling block. This makes the code much more readable and easier to follow.
