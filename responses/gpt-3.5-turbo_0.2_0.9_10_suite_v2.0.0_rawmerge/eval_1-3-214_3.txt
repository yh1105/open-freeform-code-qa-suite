The error message you are getting suggests that the `join_axes` parameter is not supported in the version of Pandas you are using. This parameter was deprecated in Pandas 0.25 and removed in Pandas 1.0.

To solve this problem, you can try upgrading the `pandas-profiling` package to the latest version, which should be compatible with the latest version of Pandas. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal or Anaconda prompt:

```
conda install -c conda-forge pandas-profiling
```

Alternatively, you can try downgrading your Pandas version to a version that is compatible with the `join_axes` parameter. You can do this by running the following command:

```
conda install pandas=0.24
```

Once you have resolved the compatibility issue, you can try running the `ProfileReport` function again. Here's an example of how you can use it:

```python
import pandas as pd
import pandas_profiling

# Load data into a Pandas DataFrame
data = pd.read_csv('data.csv')

# Generate a profile report
profile = pandas_profiling.ProfileReport(data)

# Save the report to an HTML file
profile.to_file('report.html')
```

This should generate a profile report for your data and save it to an HTML file named `report.html`.
