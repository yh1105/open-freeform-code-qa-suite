This error message indicates that the file system is mounted as read-only, which means that you cannot create new directories or modify existing files. 

To fix this issue, you can try the following steps:

1. Check the file system's status by running the following command:

   ```
   mount | grep ' / '
   ```

   This command will display the status of the root file system. If it is mounted as read-only, you will need to remount it as read-write.

2. Remount the file system as read-write by running the following command:

   ```
   sudo mount -uw /
   ```

   This command will remount the root file system as read-write.

3. Create the directory by running the following command:

   ```
   sudo mkdir -p /data/db
   ```

   This command will create the directory `/data/db` with the necessary permissions.

After following these steps, you should be able to create the directory without any issues.
