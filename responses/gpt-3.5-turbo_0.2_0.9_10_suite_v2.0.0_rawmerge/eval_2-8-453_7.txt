The err113 error from golangci-lint is suggesting that you should not define dynamic errors using `errors.New()` and instead use wrapped static errors. 

To fix this, you can create a static error variable and use it instead of defining a new error each time. Here's an example:

```
var (
    errRepo = errors.New("repo gave err")
    errOops = errors.New("oops")
)

// ...

repoMock.EXPECT().Save(gomock.Eq(&foooBarBar)).Return(nil, errRepo)
repoMock.EXPECT().FindAll().Return(nil, errOops)
```

By defining the errors as variables, you can reuse them throughout your code and avoid creating new errors each time. This makes your code more efficient and easier to maintain.
