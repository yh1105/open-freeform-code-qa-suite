This error message suggests that the preview target is not included in the current scheme. You can try the following steps to fix this issue:

1. Open the project settings by clicking on the project in the project navigator and selecting "Edit Scheme".
2. Select the "Test" action on the left-hand side.
3. Make sure that the preview target is selected in the "Test" action.
4. If the preview target is not listed, click the "+" button and add it to the list.
5. Save the changes and try running the preview again.

If this doesn't work, you can also try cleaning the build folder by selecting "Product" from the menu bar, holding down the Option key, and selecting "Clean Build Folder".
