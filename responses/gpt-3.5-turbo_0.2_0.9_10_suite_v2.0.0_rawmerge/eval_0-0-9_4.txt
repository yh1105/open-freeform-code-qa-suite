Sure! The error message "Error: req#logout requires a callback function" means that the `req.logout()` function requires a callback function as an argument. You can add an empty callback function to resolve the issue. Here's the revised code:

```javascript
app.get("/logout", (req, res) => {
    req.logout();
    res.redirect("/");
}, function(err) {
    console.log(err);
});
```

This should resolve the error message you were seeing.
