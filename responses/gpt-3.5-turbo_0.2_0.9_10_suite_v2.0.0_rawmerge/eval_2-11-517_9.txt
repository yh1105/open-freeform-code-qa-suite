In C++, you can use the `std::string` class and the `+` operator to concatenate strings and variables. Here's an example:

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

int main() {
    int myVariable = 42;
    std::string myString = "My variable has value " + std::to_string(myVariable);
    std::cout << myString << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

This will output:

```
My variable has value 42
```

Note that you need to convert the integer variable to a string using `std::to_string()` before concatenating it with the string.
