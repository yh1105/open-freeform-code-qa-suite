It seems like you are having trouble using the SelectByID2 method in SolidWorks API to select objects for creating a reference plane. One approach you can take is to create reference points on the selected face and edge to identify the face somehow. Another option is to identify an object name and type to solve the problem. You can create reference points when using one of the appropriate Selection methods, because their names are known, and use those for SelectByID2 method. Once you have selected the objects, you can use the InsertRefPlane method to create the reference plane.
