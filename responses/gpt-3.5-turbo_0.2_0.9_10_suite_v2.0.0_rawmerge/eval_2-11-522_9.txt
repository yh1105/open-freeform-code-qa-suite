No. 

C++ does not provide a standard way to query the properties of threads or enforce on which cores they will run. The behavior of threads is dependent on the underlying operating system and hardware, and C++ only provides a high-level interface for creating and managing threads. 

However, some operating systems and hardware architectures may provide specific APIs or tools for managing thread affinity and performance, which can be used in conjunction with C++ code.
