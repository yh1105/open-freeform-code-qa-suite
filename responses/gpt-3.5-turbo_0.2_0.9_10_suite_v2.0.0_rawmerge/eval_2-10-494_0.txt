This error message is caused by a bug in rust-analyzer, which is a language server for Rust that provides IDE-like features such as code completion and error highlighting. The error message is indicating that rust-analyzer is having trouble resolving the `format_args` macro, which is used internally by the `pad_str` function.

This error message is a false positive and can be safely ignored. There is no issue with your code, and it will still compile and run correctly. You can continue to use rust-analyzer for its other features, such as code completion and error highlighting, but you may want to keep an eye out for updates that fix this bug.

If you want to suppress the error message in your editor, you can try disabling the rust-analyzer extension or adding a comment to your code to ignore the error, like this:

```rust
#[allow(unused_macros)]
use console::{Alignment, pad_str};
``` 

This will tell the Rust compiler to ignore the error, but it will not affect the behavior of your code.
