Your code looks correct. However, if the user denies the location permission, the code inside the `getCurrentPosition` callback function will not execute. To handle this case, you can add a second parameter to the `getCurrentPosition` method, which is a function that will be called if the user denies the location permission. Here's the revised code:

```javascript
if (navigator.geolocation) {
    navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(
        position => {
            console.log("Location accessed");
        },
        error => {
            console.log("User not allowed");
        }
    );
} else {
    console.log("Geolocation is not supported by this browser.");
}
```

With this code, if the user denies the location permission, the `console.log("User not allowed")` message will be printed.
