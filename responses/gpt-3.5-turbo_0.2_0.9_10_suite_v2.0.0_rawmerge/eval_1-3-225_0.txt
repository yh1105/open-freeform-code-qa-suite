Here's the revised code for the `pig_latin` function:

```python
def pig_latin(text):
  words = text.split()
  pig_latin_words = []
  for word in words:
    endString = str(word[1:]).lower()
    startString = str(word[0]).lower()
    pig_latin_words.append(endString + startString + 'ay')
  return ' '.join(pig_latin_words)
```

The main changes are:

- Instead of initializing `say` to an empty string, we initialize an empty list `pig_latin_words` to store the pig Latin words.
- We iterate through each word in `words` and perform the necessary transformations to create the pig Latin version of the word.
- We append the pig Latin version of the word to `pig_latin_words`.
- Finally, we join all the words in `pig_latin_words` with a space and return the resulting string.

With these changes, the function should correctly convert the input text to pig Latin.
