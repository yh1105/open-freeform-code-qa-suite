It looks like the issue is with the response from the server. The error message suggests that the response is not in a valid JSON format. 

One thing you can try is to remove the `[Route("api/Employee/Index")]` attribute from the `Index` method in your `EmployeeController`. This attribute is redundant since you already have the `[Route("[controller]")]` attribute on the controller itself. 

Your updated `EmployeeController` should look like this:

```c#
[ApiController]
[Route("[controller]")]
public class EmployeeController : ControllerBase
{
    EmployeeRepository objemployee = new EmployeeRepository();
    
    [HttpGet]
    public IEnumerable<Employee> Get()
    {
        return objemployee.GetAllEmployees();
    }
}
```

Then, in your Blazor component, you can update the `Http.GetJsonAsync` call to use the relative URL of the API endpoint:

```c#
empList = await Http.GetJsonAsync<Employee[]>("/Employee");
```

This should fix the issue and allow you to retrieve the list of employees from the server.
