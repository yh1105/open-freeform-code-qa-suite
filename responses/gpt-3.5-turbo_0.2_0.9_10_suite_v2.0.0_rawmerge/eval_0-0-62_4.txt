The error message is indicating that you are using a non-primitive value as a key in your `v-for` loop. In your code, you are using `:key="comment"`, which means that Vue is trying to use the entire `comment` object as the key for each item in the loop. 

To fix this, you should use a unique identifier for each item as the key. In your case, the `comment.id` property would be a good choice. You can update your code like this:

```html
<template>
    <div class="container">
        <h2>{{ story.title }}</h2>
        <p>Score: {{ story.score }}</p>
        <p>{{ story.url }}</p>
        <div v-for="comment in comments" :key="comment.id">
          <div class="comment-wrap">
                <div class="comment-block">
                    <p class="comment-text">{{ comment.text }}</p>
                    <div class="bottom-comment">
                        <div class="comment-author">{{ comment.by }}</div>
                        <div class="comment-date">{{ comment.time }}</div>
                    </div>
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>
</template>
```

By using `comment.id` as the key, Vue will be able to track each item in the loop more efficiently and avoid the warning message.
