You can achieve this by iterating over the first `n` elements of `b` (where `n` is the length of `rest`) and replacing them with the corresponding elements from `rest`. Then, you can iterate over `last` and replace any element that matches an element in `b` with the corresponding element from `rest`.

Here's the implementation of the `ReplaceElementsByIndex` function:

```python
def ReplaceElementsByIndex(rest, b, last):
    # Replace the first n elements of b with the elements from rest
    n = len(rest)
    for i in range(n):
        b[i] = rest[i]
    
    # Replace the elements in last according to the matches with b
    for i in range(len(last)):
        if last[i] in b:
            index = b.index(last[i])
            last[i] = rest[index]
    
    return last
```

You can call this function with your example lists like this:

```python
rest = [5, 7, 11, 4]
b = [21, 22, 33, 31, 23, 15, 19, 13, 6]
last = [33, 19, 40, 21, 31, 22, 6, 15, 13, 23]

result = ReplaceElementsByIndex(rest, b, last)
print(result)  # Output: [11, 19, 40, 5, 4, 7, 6, 15, 13, 23]
```
