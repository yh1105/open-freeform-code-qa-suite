The issue might be related to the compatibility of the Selenium WebDriver with the version of Internet Explorer installed on your machine. 

Excel 2019 comes with Internet Explorer 11, which might not be fully compatible with the Selenium WebDriver. You can try the following steps to fix the issue:

1. Make sure that you have the latest version of the Selenium WebDriver installed. You can download it from the official Selenium website.

2. Try using a different browser such as Chrome or Firefox to see if the issue persists.

3. If you still want to use Internet Explorer, try downgrading to an earlier version of Internet Explorer (e.g. version 9 or 10) and see if the issue is resolved.

4. If none of the above steps work, you can try using a different version of Excel (e.g. Excel 2016) to see if the issue is specific to Excel 2019.

I hope this helps!
