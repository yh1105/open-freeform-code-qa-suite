The error message "fork/exec /var/task/main: no such file or directory" indicates that the Lambda function is unable to find the executable file "main" in the expected location "/var/task/". This is likely because the executable file was not properly packaged in the ZIP file that was uploaded to AWS Lambda.

To properly package the executable file, you should follow these steps:

1. Build the executable file for Linux platform by running the following command in the terminal:

   ```
   GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go build main.go
   ```

   This will create a binary file named "main" that is compatible with the Linux operating system.

2. Create a ZIP file that includes the "main" binary file by running the following command in the terminal:

   ```
   zip main.zip main
   ```

   This will create a ZIP file named "main.zip" that includes the "main" binary file.

3. Upload the "main.zip" file to AWS Lambda and set the handler to "main".

After following these steps, your Lambda function should be able to find and execute the "main" binary file without any issues.
