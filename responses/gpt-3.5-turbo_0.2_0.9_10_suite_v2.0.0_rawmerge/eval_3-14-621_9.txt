You cannot access `@State` variables outside of the `body` property of a `View`. One solution is to use a `@Binding` variable instead, which can be initialized in the `init()` method of a `Struct`. Here's an example of how you can modify your code to use a `@Binding` variable:

```
struct StateFromOutside: View {
    let list = [
        "a": "Letter A",
        "b": "Letter B",
        // ...
    ]
    @Binding var fullText: String

    init(letter: String) {
        self._fullText = Binding<String>(
            get: { self.list[letter]! },
            set: { self.fullText = $0 }
        )
    }

    var body: some View {
        TextField("", text: $fullText)
    }
}
```

In this example, we use a computed property to initialize the `@Binding` variable in the `init()` method. The `get` closure returns the value from the dictionary based on the `letter` parameter, and the `set` closure updates the `fullText` variable with the new value. Finally, we use the `$fullText` syntax to bind the `TextField` to the `fullText` variable.
