It seems like the Dockerfile is unable to find the `app` module. You can try updating the `COPY` command in the Dockerfile to include the parent directory of the `app` module. 

Here's an updated Dockerfile:

```Dockerfile
FROM python:3.8
WORKDIR /app

COPY requirements.txt /
RUN pip install --requirement /requirements.txt

COPY . /app

EXPOSE 8000
CMD ["uvicorn", "app.main:app", "--host=0.0.0.0" , "--reload" , "--port", "8000"]
```

In this updated Dockerfile, the `COPY` command copies the entire project directory (including the `app` module) to the `/app` directory in the Docker container. 

After updating the Dockerfile, you can rebuild the Docker image and start the container using the following commands:

```bash
docker-compose build
docker-compose up -d
``` 

This should resolve the `ModuleNotFoundError` issue.
