The warning is caused by the fact that the value of the key `1` in the `myMap` map is nullable (`String?`), but the variable `s` is non-nullable (`String`). To solve the warning, you can either change the type of the variable `s` to nullable (`String?`) or use the null-aware operator (`?`) to access the value of the key `1`. Here are two possible solutions:

Solution 1: Change the type of the variable `s` to nullable (`String?`):
```dart
void foo(Map<int, String> myMap) {
  if (myMap.containsKey(1)) {
    String? s = myMap[1];
  }
}
```

Solution 2: Use the null-aware operator (`?`) to access the value of the key `1`:
```dart
void foo(Map<int, String> myMap) {
  String s = myMap[1]?;
  if (s != null) {
    // Do something with s
  }
}
```
In this solution, the null-aware operator (`?`) returns `null` if the value of the key `1` is `null`, and returns the value of the key `1` as a non-nullable `String` otherwise. The `if` statement checks if `s` is not `null` before doing something with it.
