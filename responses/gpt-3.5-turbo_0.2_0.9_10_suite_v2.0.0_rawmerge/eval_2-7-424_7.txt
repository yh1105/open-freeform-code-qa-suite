The error message "Failed to clear cache. Make sure you have the appropriate permissions." indicates that the user running the command does not have the necessary permissions to clear the cache. This could be due to file ownership or file permissions issues. 

You can try running the command with elevated privileges using `sudo` or check the file permissions of the cache directory and ensure that the user running the command has write access to it.
