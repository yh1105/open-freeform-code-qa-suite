It's possible that the issue is related to the dynamic route, but it's hard to say without more information. Here are a few things you can try:

1. Check your Vercel logs: When you deploy your app to Vercel, it should give you a URL where you can view the logs for your deployment. Check these logs to see if there are any errors or warnings that might help you diagnose the issue.

2. Check your `package.json` file: Make sure that your `start` script is set to `next start`. This is the command that Vercel will use to start your app.

3. Check your `next.config.js` file: If you don't have a `next.config.js` file, you can create one in the root of your project. Make sure that you have the following code in it:

```
module.exports = {
  target: 'serverless'
}
```

This tells Next.js to build your app for a serverless environment, which is what Vercel uses.

4. Check your dynamic route: If you have a dynamic route in your app, make sure that it's set up correctly. For example, if you have a file called `pages/posts/[id].js`, make sure that you're using `getStaticPaths` and `getStaticProps` to generate the pages at build time.

5. Check your `yarn.lock` file: Make sure that your `yarn.lock` file is up to date and that you're not using any outdated dependencies.

Hopefully one of these solutions will help you fix the issue. If not, feel free to provide more information about your app and the error message you're seeing, and I can try to help you further.
