You can use a list comprehension to iterate over each tensor in the list and get its size using the `.size()` method of PyTorch tensors. Here's the implementation of the `getSize` function:

```python
import torch

def getSize(t):
    return [tensor.size() for tensor in t]
```

You can call this function with your list of PyTorch tensors as an argument and it will return a list of sizes of each tensor in the input list.
