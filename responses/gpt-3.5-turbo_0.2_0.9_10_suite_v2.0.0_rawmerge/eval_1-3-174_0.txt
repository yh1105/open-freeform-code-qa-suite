This error can occur when there is a mismatch between the Python version and the psycopg2 package version. 

You can try uninstalling and reinstalling psycopg2 using pip instead of conda. First, activate your conda environment by running `conda activate wr` in the terminal. Then, run `pip uninstall psycopg2` to uninstall the package. Finally, run `pip install psycopg2-binary` to install the binary version of psycopg2. 

If this doesn't work, you can also try installing the psycopg2 package from the Unofficial Windows Binaries for Python Extension Packages website: https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#psycopg. Download the appropriate .whl file for your Python version and platform, and then install it using pip: `pip install path/to/psycopg2-<version>-cp<python_version>-cp<python_version>-<platform>.whl`.

After installing psycopg2, try running your sample app again and see if the error persists.
