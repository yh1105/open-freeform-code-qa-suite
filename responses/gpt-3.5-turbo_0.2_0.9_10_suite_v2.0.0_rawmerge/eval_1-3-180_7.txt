To filter the data based on a specific value of a column and group it by that column, you can use the following code:

```python
pass_tests = data_useless[data_useless['TEST_STATUS'] == 'PASS TEST'].groupby('TEST_STATUS')
```

This will create a new DataFrame called `pass_tests` that contains only the rows where the `TEST_STATUS` column is equal to `'PASS TEST'`, and then group the data by the `TEST_STATUS` column.

You can then perform operations on this new DataFrame, such as counting the number of rows in each group:

```python
pass_tests.count()
```

Or getting the mean value of a specific column:

```python
pass_tests['TEST_DATE'].mean()
```

Note that you can also chain these operations together:

```python
data_useless[data_useless['TEST_STATUS'] == 'PASS TEST'].groupby('TEST_STATUS').count()
```

This will give you the same result as the first example, but in a single line of code.
