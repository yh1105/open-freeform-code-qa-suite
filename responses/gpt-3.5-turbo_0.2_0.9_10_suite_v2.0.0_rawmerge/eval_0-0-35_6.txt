To connect to Heroku Redis using TLS on Node, you should use the `REDIS_TLS_URL` environment variable instead of `REDIS_URL`. Here's an example code snippet using `node_redis` v3:

```javascript
const redis = require('redis');
const url = require('url');

const redisUrl = url.parse(process.env.REDIS_TLS_URL);
const client = redis.createClient(redisUrl.port, redisUrl.hostname, {
  tls: {
    rejectUnauthorized: false
  }
});

client.auth(redisUrl.auth.split(":")[1]);
client.on('connect', () => {
  console.log('Connected to Redis');
});

client.on('error', (err) => {
  console.error('Error connecting to Redis:', err);
});
```

Note that the `rejectUnauthorized` option is set to `false` in the `tls` object. This is because Heroku Redis uses a self-signed certificate, so the certificate cannot be verified by a trusted certificate authority. Setting `rejectUnauthorized` to `false` disables certificate verification and allows the connection to be established. However, this is not recommended for production environments, as it can leave your application vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks. In production, you should use a trusted certificate authority or a custom certificate.
