You can add your existing SSH key to Git Bash by following these steps:

1. Open Git Bash and navigate to your home directory by typing `cd ~`.
2. Create a new directory called `.ssh` by typing `mkdir .ssh`.
3. Move your SSH key to the `.ssh` directory by typing `mv D:/keys/id_rsa ~/.ssh/`.
4. Set the permissions for the SSH key by typing `chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_rsa`.
5. Add the SSH key to the SSH agent by typing `ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa`.

After completing these steps, your SSH key should be added to Git Bash and you should be able to clone repositories from remote.
