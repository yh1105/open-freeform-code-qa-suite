The error is caused by using a non-primitive value as the key in the `v-for` loop. In your case, the `comment` object is being used as the key, which is not recommended. Instead, you should use a unique identifier for each comment as the key. 

For example, if each comment has a unique `id` property, you can use that as the key:

```html
<div v-for="comment in comments" :key="comment.id">
```

This will ensure that each comment is uniquely identified and prevent the warning message from appearing.
