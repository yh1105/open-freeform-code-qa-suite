It seems like the module `github.ibm.com/kms/key-protect-client` is not being downloaded to the module cache on computer B. Here are some steps you can take to debug this issue:

1. Check if the module is present in the module cache on computer B. You can do this by running the following command:

   ```bash
   go list -m github.ibm.com/kms/key-protect-client@v0.1.5
   ```

   If the module is present in the cache, you should see output similar to the following:

   ```
   github.ibm.com/kms/key-protect-client v0.1.5
   ```

   If the module is not present in the cache, you will see an error message.

2. Check if the module is accessible from computer B. You can do this by running the following command:

   ```bash
   go list -m -versions github.ibm.com/kms/key-protect-client
   ```

   This command will list all available versions of the module. If the module is not accessible, you will see an error message.

3. Check if the module is using the correct version. You can do this by checking the `go.mod` file in your project directory. Make sure that the version of the module specified in the `go.mod` file matches the version you are trying to use.

4. Check if there are any network issues on computer B that might be preventing the module from being downloaded. You can try running the following command to see if there are any issues:

   ```bash
   ping github.ibm.com
   ```

   If there are network issues, you will see an error message.

Hopefully, one of these steps will help you identify the issue and resolve it.
