The error message indicates that you cannot set the body fields of a request with content-type "application/json". Therefore, you need to convert the body data to a JSON string before sending it. You can use the `jsonEncode` method from the `dart:convert` library to convert the body data to a JSON string. Here's how you can modify your code to fix the issue:

```dart
import 'dart:convert';

Map<String,String> headers = {'Content-Type':'application/json','authorization':'Basic c3R1ZHlkb3RlOnN0dWR5ZG90ZTEyMw=='};

var response = await post(Urls.getToken,
        headers: headers,
        body: jsonEncode({"grant_type":"password","username":"******","password":"*****","scope":"offline_access"}),
      );
```

By using `jsonEncode`, the body data is converted to a JSON string, which can be sent as the request body.
