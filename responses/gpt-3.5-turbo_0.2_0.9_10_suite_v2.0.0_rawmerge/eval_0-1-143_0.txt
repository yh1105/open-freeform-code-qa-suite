You can modify the `browser.css` file in Firefox to reduce the spacing between menu items. Here's how:

1. Open Firefox and type `about:config` in the address bar.
2. Search for `toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets` and set it to `true`.
3. Open your Firefox profile folder. You can find the location of your profile folder by typing `about:support` in the address bar and looking for "Profile Folder" under "Application Basics".
4. In your profile folder, create a new folder called `chrome` if it doesn't already exist.
5. Inside the `chrome` folder, create a new file called `userChrome.css`.
6. Open `userChrome.css` in a text editor and add the following code:

```
/* Reduce spacing between menu items */
#PanelUI-menu .panel-subview-body > :not(:first-child) {
  margin-block-start: 0 !important;
}
```

7. Save the file and restart Firefox.

This code targets the menu items in the Firefox menu (also known as the "hamburger menu") and reduces the top margin of all items except the first one, effectively reducing the spacing between them. You can adjust the `margin-block-start` value to your liking.
