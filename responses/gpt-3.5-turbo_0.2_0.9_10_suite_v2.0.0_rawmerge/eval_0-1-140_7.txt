With Font Awesome 5, the syntax for using icons has changed. You need to use the `font-family` property with the value `"Font Awesome 5 Free"` or `"Font Awesome 5 Pro"` depending on the version you are using. Also, the icon codes have changed from the `"\fXXX"` format to the `"fa-XXX"` format. Here's the updated code:

```css
#mainNav .navbar-collapse .navbar-sidenav .nav-link-collapse:after {
  float: right;
  content: "\f107";
  font-family: "Font Awesome 5 Free";
}
```

In the above code, `"\f107"` is the icon code for the angle-down icon in Font Awesome 5 Free. You can replace it with the code for the icon you want to use.
