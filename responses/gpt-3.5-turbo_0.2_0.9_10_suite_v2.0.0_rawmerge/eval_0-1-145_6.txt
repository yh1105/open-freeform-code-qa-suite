In TailwindCSS, the `truncate` class only works if the parent element has a fixed width. You can add the `w-XX` class to the parent element to give it a fixed width. For example:

```html
<div class="ml-1 inline-block w-64">
   <span>Label: </span>
   <span class="font-semibold truncate">
     long texttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttt
   </span>
</div>
```

In this example, the parent element has a width of `64` which means that the text will be truncated if it overflows beyond that width. You can adjust the width to fit your needs.
