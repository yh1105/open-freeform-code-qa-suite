This warning is related to Elasticsearch's built-in security features not being enabled. Without authentication, your Elasticsearch cluster could be accessible to anyone. 

To fix this, you need to enable Elasticsearch security features. Here are the steps:

1. Open your Elasticsearch configuration file. You can find it in your Rails app's `config` directory. The file is named `elasticsearch.yml`.

2. Add the following lines to the end of the file:

   ```
   xpack.security.enabled: true
   xpack.security.transport.ssl.enabled: true
   xpack.security.transport.ssl.verification_mode: certificate
   ```

3. Save the file and restart Elasticsearch.

   If you're using Elasticsearch with Searchkick, you can restart Elasticsearch by running the following command in your terminal:

   ```
   bin/elasticsearch
   ```

   If you're using Elasticsearch with a different tool, consult the documentation for that tool to learn how to restart Elasticsearch.

After restarting Elasticsearch, the warning should disappear.
