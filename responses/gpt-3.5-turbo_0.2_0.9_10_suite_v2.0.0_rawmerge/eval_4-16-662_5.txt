You can use the `jq` command-line tool to minify JSON in a shell script. `jq` is a lightweight and flexible command-line JSON processor that can be used to manipulate and transform JSON data.

To minify JSON using `jq`, you can use the following command:

```
jq -c . input.json
```

This command reads the JSON data from the `input.json` file and outputs the minified JSON to the console.

If you want to pass the minified JSON to another command, you can use command substitution to capture the output of the `jq` command and pass it as an argument to the next command. For example, to pass the minified JSON to `httpie`, you can use the following command:

```
http POST http://example.com/api/data "$(jq -c . input.json)"
```

This command sends a POST request to `http://example.com/api/data` with the minified JSON data from `input.json` as the request body.
