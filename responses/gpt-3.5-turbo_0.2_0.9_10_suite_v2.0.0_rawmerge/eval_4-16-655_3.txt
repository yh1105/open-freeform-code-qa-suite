This issue is caused by the way GitLab CI/CD handles variable expansion. GitLab CI/CD uses its own custom shell, which does not support nested parameter expansion. As a workaround, you can use a script block to perform the nested parameter expansion using a shell that supports it, such as `bash`. Here's an example:

```
variables:
  GIT_BRANCH: ""

job1:
  script:
    - GIT_BRANCH="${CI_MERGE_REQUEST_SOURCE_BRANCH_NAME:-${CI_COMMIT_BRANCH:-$CI_DEFAULT_BRANCH}}"
    - echo $GIT_BRANCH
```
