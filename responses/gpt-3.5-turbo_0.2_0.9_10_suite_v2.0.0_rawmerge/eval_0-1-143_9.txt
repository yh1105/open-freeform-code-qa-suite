You can modify the `browser.css` file in Firefox to adjust the spacing between menu items. Here are the steps to do it:

1. Open Firefox and type `about:config` in the address bar.
2. Search for `toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets` and set it to `true`.
3. Open your Firefox profile folder. You can find the location of your profile folder by typing `about:support` in the address bar and looking for the "Profile Folder" entry.
4. In your profile folder, create a new folder called `chrome` if it doesn't already exist.
5. Inside the `chrome` folder, create a new file called `userChrome.css`.
6. Open the `userChrome.css` file in a text editor.
7. Add the following code to the file:

```
/* Reduce spacing between menu items */
menupopup > menuitem {
  padding-top: 4px !important;
  padding-bottom: 4px !important;
}
```

8. Save the file and restart Firefox.

This code reduces the top and bottom padding of menu items to 4 pixels. You can adjust the value to your liking. If you want to target a specific menu, you can use its ID in the CSS selector. For example, to target the bookmarks menu, you can use `#BMB_bookmarksPopup > menuitem`.
