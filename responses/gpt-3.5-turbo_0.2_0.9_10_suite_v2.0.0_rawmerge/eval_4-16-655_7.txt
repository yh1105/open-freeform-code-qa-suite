This issue is caused by the way GitLab CI/CD processes variable expansion. In GitLab CI/CD, variables are expanded in two stages: first, the variables are expanded in the YAML file, and then they are expanded again in the runner environment. This means that nested variable expansion may not work as expected.

To work around this issue, you can use a shell command to perform the nested expansion. For example, you can use the following script in your job:

```
job1:
  script:
    - GIT_BRANCH="${CI_MERGE_REQUEST_SOURCE_BRANCH_NAME:-${CI_COMMIT_BRANCH:-$CI_DEFAULT_BRANCH}}"
    - echo $(eval echo $GIT_BRANCH)
```

This script sets the `GIT_BRANCH` variable using nested expansion, and then uses the `eval` command to perform the nested expansion in the runner environment. The `echo` command then outputs the expanded value of `GIT_BRANCH`.
