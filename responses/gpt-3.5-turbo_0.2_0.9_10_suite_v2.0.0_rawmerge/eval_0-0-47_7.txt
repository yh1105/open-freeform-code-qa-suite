To define an array of objects with a specific structure, you can use an interface. Here's an example:

```typescript
interface Product {
  name: string;
  price: number;
  description: string;
}

const bagTotal = (products: Product[]) => {
  // function does stuff
}
```

This defines an interface called `Product` with three properties: `name`, `price`, and `description`. Then, the `bagTotal` function takes an array of objects that conform to the `Product` interface.
