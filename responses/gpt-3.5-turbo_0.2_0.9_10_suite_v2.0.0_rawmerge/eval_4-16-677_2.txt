The issue with your script is that the variable `$searchT` is enclosed in single quotes within the `if` statement. Single quotes prevent variable expansion, so the value of `$searchT` is not being passed to the `grep` command. To fix this, you can use double quotes instead of single quotes to enclose the `grep` command within the `if` statement. Here's the corrected script:

```
#!/bin/bash
read -p "enter search term here: " searchT

if [[ $(cat test.txt | grep -wi "$searchT") ]]; then     
    echo "$(cat test.txt | grep "$searchT" | wc -l) number of matches found"
    echo $(cat test.txt | grep "$searchT")

else 
    echo "no match found"    
fi

exit 0
```

In this updated script, the `grep` command within the `if` statement is enclosed in double quotes, which allows the value of `$searchT` to be passed to the command. Additionally, I've added a pipe to the `wc -l` command to count the number of matches found by `grep`.
