Yes, you can detect if the user's system is in Dark Mode by checking the value of the `prefers-color-scheme` media query. This media query returns `dark` if the user's system is in Dark Mode, and `light` otherwise.

Here's an example of how to use it in CSS:

```css
@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
  /* Styles for Dark Mode */
}

@media (prefers-color-scheme: light) {
  /* Styles for Light Mode */
}
```

You can also use JavaScript to detect the value of the `prefers-color-scheme` media query and apply different styles based on the result. Here's an example:

```javascript
if (window.matchMedia && window.matchMedia('(prefers-color-scheme: dark)').matches) {
  // Dark Mode
} else {
  // Light Mode
}
```

Note that not all browsers support the `prefers-color-scheme` media query yet, so you may need to provide fallback styles for older browsers.
