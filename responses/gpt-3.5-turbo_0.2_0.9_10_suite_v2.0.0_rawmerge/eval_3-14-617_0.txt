This error usually occurs when there is an issue with the build settings or the project configuration. Here are some steps you can try to resolve the issue:

1. Clean the project: Go to Product > Clean Build Folder. This will delete all the build artifacts and force Xcode to rebuild the project from scratch.

2. Check the build settings: Make sure that the build settings are correct for your project. Go to Project > Build Settings and check if there are any errors or warnings. Fix any issues that you find.

3. Check the script: The error message indicates that there is an issue with the script that is being executed. Check the script and make sure that it is correct. You can find the script in the Build Phases section of your project.

4. Update the pods: Try updating the pods to the latest version. Run `pod update` in the terminal to update all the pods in your project.

5. Reinstall the pods: If updating the pods doesn't work, try reinstalling them. Run `pod deintegrate` to remove all the pods from your project and then run `pod install` to reinstall them.

6. Check for any missing frameworks: Make sure that all the required frameworks are added to your project. Go to Project > General > Linked Frameworks and Libraries and check if all the required frameworks are added. If any framework is missing, add it to the project.

7. Check for any missing files: Make sure that all the required files are added to your project. Go to Project > Build Phases > Copy Bundle Resources and check if all the required files are added. If any file is missing, add it to the project.

If none of the above steps work, try creating a new project and adding the required libraries and files to it. This should resolve the issue.
