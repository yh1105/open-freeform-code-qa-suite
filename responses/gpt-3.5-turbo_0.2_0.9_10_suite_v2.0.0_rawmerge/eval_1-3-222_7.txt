Here's the Python function `func` that computes the number of ways to form a string of length `n` using `k` characters such that at most two adjacent characters can be same:

```python
def func(n, k):
    if n == 1:
        return k
    if n == 2:
        return k * (k - 1) + k
    dp = [0] * (n + 1)
    dp[1] = k
    dp[2] = k * (k - 1) + k
    for i in range(3, n + 1):
        dp[i] = (k - 1) * (dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2])
    return dp[n]
```

The function uses dynamic programming to compute the number of ways to form a string of length `n` using `k` characters such that at most two adjacent characters can be same. The base cases are `n=1` and `n=2`, which are computed directly. For `n>2`, the function uses a dynamic programming approach to compute the number of valid strings of length `i` using the number of valid strings of length `i-1` and `i-2`. The final result is stored in `dp[n]`.
