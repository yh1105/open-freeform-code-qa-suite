To read a CSV file from Google Drive, you need to modify the URL of the file. Here's how you can do it:

```python
import pandas as pd

def processURL(url):
    file_id = url.split('/')[-2]
    dwn_url = 'https://drive.google.com/uc?id=' + file_id
    return pd.read_csv(dwn_url)
```

In this function, we first extract the file ID from the URL by splitting the URL and taking the second last element. Then we construct a new URL by appending the file ID to `'https://drive.google.com/uc?id='`. Finally, we use `pd.read_csv()` to read the CSV file from the new URL.

You can call this function with your original URL as follows:

```python
url = 'https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B6GhBwm5vaB2ekdlZW5WZnppb28/view?usp=sharing'
df = processURL(url)
```

This should give you a pandas DataFrame containing the data from the CSV file.
