It seems like there is an issue with removing the `requests` and `setuptools` packages from the conda environment. One possible solution is to create a new environment and install the required packages in that environment. Here are the steps to create a new environment and install the required packages:

1. Open the Anaconda Prompt.
2. Create a new environment using the following command:

   ```bash
   conda create --name myenv python=3.6
   ```

   Replace `myenv` with the name you want to give to your new environment.

3. Activate the new environment using the following command:

   ```bash
   conda activate myenv
   ```

   Replace `myenv` with the name of your new environment.

4. Install the required packages using the following command:

   ```bash
   conda install --file python3.6-environment-windows.yml
   ```

   Replace `python3.6-environment-windows.yml` with the name of the file that contains the list of required packages.

5. Once the installation is complete, you can deactivate the environment using the following command:

   ```bash
   conda deactivate
   ```

   This will return you to the base environment.

6. You can now activate your new environment using the following command:

   ```bash
   conda activate myenv
   ```

   Replace `myenv` with the name of your new environment.

7. You should now be able to use the third party library in your new environment.
