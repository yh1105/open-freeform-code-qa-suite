This error message indicates that the integrity check of the downloaded package has failed. Here are some possible measures to resolve the issue:

1. Clear the npm cache by running `npm cache clean --force` and try running `npm install` again.

2. Delete the `node_modules` folder and `package-lock.json` file, then run `npm install` again.

3. Upgrade npm to the latest version by running `npm install -g npm@latest` and try running `npm install` again.

4. If you are using a private registry, try adding the `--no-shrinkwrap` flag to the `npm install` command.

5. If none of the above solutions work, try deleting the `node_modules` folder, `package-lock.json` file, and `npm-shrinkwrap.json` file (if it exists), then run `npm install` again.

6. If you are still experiencing issues, try running `npm config set registry http://registry.npmjs.org/` to switch to the default registry and try running `npm install` again.
