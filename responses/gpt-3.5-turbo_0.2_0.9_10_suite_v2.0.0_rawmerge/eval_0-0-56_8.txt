It seems that the issue is related to the way you are running the Vite server inside the Docker container. By default, Vite binds to `localhost`, which means that it only accepts connections from the same machine. However, when you try to access it from outside the container (e.g., from your host machine), you are trying to connect to the container's IP address, not to `localhost`.

To fix this issue, you need to tell Vite to bind to `0.0.0.0`, which means that it will accept connections from any IP address. You can do this by adding the `host` option to your Vite configuration:

```typescript
export default defineConfig({
    // ...
    server: {
        port: 8080,
        host: '0.0.0.0'
    }
})
```

With this configuration, Vite should be able to accept connections from outside the container. You can then run the container with the following command:

```bash
docker-compose run --publish 8080:8080 --rm app npm run vite
```

This should expose the Vite server on port 8080, and you should be able to access it from your host machine using `localhost:8080`.
