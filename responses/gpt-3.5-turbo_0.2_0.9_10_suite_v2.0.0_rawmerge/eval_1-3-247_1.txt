The error message is indicating that the `profile` URL pattern is expecting a non-empty string argument, but it is receiving an empty string. This is likely because the `author` field of the `NewPost` model is set to `null=True`, which means that some posts may not have an associated author.

To fix this error, you can modify the `profile` URL pattern to make the `<str:name>` parameter optional by adding a `?` after the parameter name:

```python
path("profile/<str:name>/", views.profile, name="profile")
```

should be changed to:

```python
path("profile/<str:name>/?", views.profile, name="profile")
```

This will allow the `name` parameter to be optional, so that posts without an associated author can still be displayed without causing a `NoReverseMatch` error.
