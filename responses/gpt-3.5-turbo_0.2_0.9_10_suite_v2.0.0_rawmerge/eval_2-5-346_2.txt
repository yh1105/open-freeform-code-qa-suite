It seems like the Gradle build is not picking up the Java version you have set in your project settings. You can try adding the following lines to your `build.gradle` file to explicitly set the Java version for the Gradle build:

```
tasks.withType(JavaCompile) {
    options.compilerArgs << '-Xlint:preview'
    options.release = 17
}
```

This will set the Java version to 17 for the Gradle build. If this doesn't work, you can also try adding the following line to your `gradle.properties` file:

```
org.gradle.java.home=/path/to/your/jdk
```

Replace `/path/to/your/jdk` with the path to your Java 17 installation. This will tell Gradle to use the specified JDK for the build.

After making these changes, try running your app again and see if the error is resolved.
