You can modify the `browser.css` file in Firefox to adjust the spacing between menu items. Here's how:

1. Open Firefox and type `about:config` in the address bar.
2. Search for `toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets` and set it to `true`.
3. Open your Firefox profile folder. You can find the location by typing `about:support` in the address bar and looking for "Profile Folder" in the "Application Basics" section.
4. Create a new folder called `chrome` if it doesn't already exist.
5. Inside the `chrome` folder, create a new file called `userChrome.css`.
6. Open the `userChrome.css` file in a text editor.
7. Add the following code to the file:

```
/* Reduce spacing between menu items */
#PanelUI-menu .panel-subview-body {
  padding-block: 4px !important;
}
```

8. Save the file and restart Firefox.

This code reduces the padding between menu items in the Firefox menu. You can adjust the `4px` value to your liking. If you want to adjust the spacing between other UI elements, you can inspect them using Firefox's built-in developer tools and modify the CSS accordingly.
