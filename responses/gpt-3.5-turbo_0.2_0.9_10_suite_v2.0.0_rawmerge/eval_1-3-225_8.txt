Here's the revised code for the `pig_latin` function:

```python
def pig_latin(text):
  words = text.split()
  pig_latin_words = []
  for word in words:
    endString = str(word[1:]).lower()
    startString = str(word[0]).lower()
    pig_latin_word = endString + startString + 'ay'
    pig_latin_words.append(pig_latin_word)
  return ' '.join(pig_latin_words)
```

The problem with the original code is that the `return` statement is inside the `for` loop, so the function returns the first word after the first iteration. Also, the logic for creating the pig Latin word is incorrect. The revised code splits the text into words, creates an empty list to store the pig Latin words, iterates through each word, creates the pig Latin word by moving the first character to the end and appending "ay", and appends the pig Latin word to the list. Finally, the function returns the list of pig Latin words joined by spaces.
