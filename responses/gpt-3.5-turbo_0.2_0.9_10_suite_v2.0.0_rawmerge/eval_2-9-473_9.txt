The error message suggests that there is an issue with the message encryption in ActiveSupport. To fix this, you can try removing the encrypted credentials file and creating a new one. Here are the steps:

1. Remove the encrypted credentials file:
```
rm -rf config/credentials.yml.enc
```
2. Create a new encrypted credentials file:
```
EDITOR="mate --wait" bin/rails credentials:edit
```
This will open the credentials file in your text editor. Add your credentials and save the file. This will create a new encrypted credentials file.

After this, commit the changes and push to Heroku. This should fix the issue with the message encryption and allow you to deploy your app successfully.
