To select the second column by name, you can use the `[[` operator with quotes around the column name. In this case, since both columns have the same name, you can use backticks to specify the column name as `a.1`. Here's the code to select the second column by name and assign it to a variable named `second_col`:

```r
second_col <- d3[["a.1"]]
``` 

Alternatively, you can use the `$` operator with backticks to select the second column by name:

```r
second_col <- d3$`a.1`
``` 

Both of these methods will select the second column with the name `a` from the `d3` data frame and assign it to the variable `second_col`.
