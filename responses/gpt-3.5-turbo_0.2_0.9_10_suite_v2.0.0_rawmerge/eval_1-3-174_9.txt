This error occurs when the psycopg2 module is not able to load the required DLL files. One possible solution is to install the psycopg2-binary package instead of the psycopg2 package. 

You can install it using the following command:
```
conda install psycopg2-binary
```

Then, replace `import psycopg2` with `import psycopg2-binary` in your code and try running it again. This should resolve the issue.
