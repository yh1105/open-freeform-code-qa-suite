You can use the `JsonResult` class to return JSON with a specific HTTP status code in your .NET Core Web API controller. Here's an example:

```c#
public IActionResult IsAuthenticated()
{
    return new JsonResult("123")
    {
        StatusCode = 200
    };
}
```

In this example, we're returning a `JsonResult` object with the value "123" and a status code of 200. You can replace 200 with any other valid HTTP status code.

Note that we're using `IActionResult` instead of `ActionResult` as the return type. This allows us to return different types of results, not just `ActionResult`.
