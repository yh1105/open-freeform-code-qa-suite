You can use the `str.replace()` method of pandas to remove the special characters from the end of each row in the "LGA" column. Here's the function `remove()` that does this:

```python
def remove(df):
    df["LGA"] = df["LGA"].str.replace(r"\s*\([^()]*\)$", "")
    return df
```

This function uses a regular expression to match the special characters at the end of each row in the "LGA" column. The regular expression `\s*\([^()]*\)$` matches:

- `\s*`: zero or more whitespace characters
- `\(`: a left parenthesis
- `[^()]*`: zero or more characters that are not left or right parentheses
- `\)` a right parenthesis
- `$`: the end of the string

The `str.replace()` method replaces each match with an empty string, effectively removing the special characters.

You can call this function with your DataFrame `df` as follows:

```python
df = remove(df)
```

This will modify the "LGA" column in `df` to remove the special characters from the end of each row.
