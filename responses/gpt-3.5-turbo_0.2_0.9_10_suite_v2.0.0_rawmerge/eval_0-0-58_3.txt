The `ERR! code EINTEGRITY` error message indicates that the integrity check of the downloaded package failed. This error can occur due to various reasons, such as network issues, corrupted cache, or a mismatch between the expected and actual checksums.

Here are some possible measures to resolve the issue:

1. Clear the npm cache by running `npm cache clean --force` and then try running `npm install` again.

2. Upgrade npm to the latest version by running `npm install -g npm@latest` and then try running `npm install` again.

3. Disable strict SSL by running `npm config set strict-ssl false` and then try running `npm install` again.

4. Delete the `node_modules` folder and `package-lock.json` file, then run `npm install` again.

5. If you are using a private registry, try adding the `--no-shrinkwrap` flag to the `npm install` command.

6. If none of the above solutions work, try deleting the `~/.npm` folder and then run `npm install` again.
