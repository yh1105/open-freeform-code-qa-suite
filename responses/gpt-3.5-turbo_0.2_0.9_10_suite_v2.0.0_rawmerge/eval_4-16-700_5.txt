You can use awk to achieve this task more efficiently. Here's an example command:

```
awk -F= '/name/{name=$2} /value/{if(name){print name "=" $2; name=""}}' input.txt > output.txt
```

This command sets the field separator to "=" and then checks if the current line starts with "name". If it does, it saves the name value. If the current line starts with "value", it checks if there is a saved name value and if so, it prints the name and value separated by "=" to the output file. This should be much faster than your current solution.
