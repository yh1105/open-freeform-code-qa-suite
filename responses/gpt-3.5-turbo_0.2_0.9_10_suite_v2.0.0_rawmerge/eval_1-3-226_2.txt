You can modify your code to check if the string contains `_` or not. If it contains `_`, then split the string and return the second element onwards. If it doesn't contain `_`, then return the original string.

Here's the modified code:

```python
def splitOne(s):
    if '_' in s:
        return '_'.join(s.split('_')[1:])
    else:
        return s
```

This function first checks if `_` is present in the string `s` using the `in` operator. If it is present, then it splits the string using `_` as the delimiter and returns everything from the second element onwards using slicing. If `_` is not present, then it simply returns the original string.

You can test this function with the following inputs:

```python
print(splitOne('testing_abc')) # Output: 'abc'
print(splitOne('xyz')) # Output: 'xyz'
print(splitOne('testing_abc_bbc')) # Output: 'abc_bbc'
```
