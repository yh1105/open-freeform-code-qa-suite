The error message indicates that the table "Keys" does not exist in the database. This could be caused by a migration issue during the upgrade process.

To solve this problem, you can try the following steps:

1. Open the Package Manager Console in Visual Studio.
2. Run the command `Update-Database` to apply any pending migrations.
3. If the migration fails, try running the command `Add-Migration <migration_name>` to create a new migration that adds the missing table to the database.
4. Run the command `Update-Database` again to apply the new migration.

If the above steps do not solve the problem, you can try deleting the database and creating a new one using the following steps:

1. Stop the application.
2. Delete the database file (usually located in the `App_Data` folder).
3. Open the Package Manager Console in Visual Studio.
4. Run the command `Add-Migration InitialCreate` to create a new migration that creates the database schema.
5. Run the command `Update-Database` to apply the migration and create the new database.
6. Restart the application.

Note that deleting the database will result in the loss of any data stored in the database. Therefore, it is recommended to backup the database before deleting it.
