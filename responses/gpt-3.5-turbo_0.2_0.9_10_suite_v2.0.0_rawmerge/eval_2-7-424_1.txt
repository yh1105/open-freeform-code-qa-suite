The error message "Failed to clear cache. Make sure you have the appropriate permissions." indicates that the user running the command does not have sufficient permissions to clear the cache. 

You can try running the command with elevated privileges by using `sudo` before the command, like this:

```
sudo php artisan cache:clear
```

This should give you the necessary permissions to clear the cache.
