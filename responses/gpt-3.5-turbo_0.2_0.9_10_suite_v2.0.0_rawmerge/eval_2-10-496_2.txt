You can use the `sort_by` method of the `Vec` to sort by multiple fields. Here's an example of how to sort `my_vector` by `row` and then by `column`:

```rust
my_vector.sort_by(|a, b| a.row.cmp(&b.row).then_with(|| a.column.cmp(&b.column)));
```

This will sort the vector by `row` first, and then by `column` if the `row` values are equal. The `then_with` method is used to specify a secondary comparison if the first comparison returns `Ordering::Equal`.

If you want to sort by more than two fields, you can chain additional `then_with` calls:

```rust
my_vector.sort_by(|a, b| a.field1.cmp(&b.field1)
    .then_with(|| a.field2.cmp(&b.field2))
    .then_with(|| a.field3.cmp(&b.field3))
    // add more fields as needed
);
```

This will sort by `field1` first, then by `field2` if `field1` values are equal, and then by `field3` if both `field1` and `field2` values are equal, and so on.
