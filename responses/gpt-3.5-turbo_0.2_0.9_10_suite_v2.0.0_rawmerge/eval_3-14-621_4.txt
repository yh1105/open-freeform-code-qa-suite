The issue is that you are trying to access the `@State` variable outside of the `body` property of the `View`. Instead, you can use a computed property to initialize the `@State` variable based on the `letter` parameter. Here's an updated version of your code:

```
struct StateFromOutside: View {
    let list = [
        "a": "Letter A",
        "b": "Letter B",
        // ...
    ]
    let letter: String
    @State var fullText: String

    init(letter: String) {
        self.letter = letter
        self._fullText = State(initialValue: list[letter]!)
    }

    var body: some View {
        TextField($fullText)
    }
}
```

In this version, we use a computed property to initialize the `@State` variable based on the `letter` parameter. We also use the `_fullText` property wrapper to access the underlying `State` variable.
