The error message is telling you that you should use a string or a number as the key in your `v-for` loop instead of using the entire `comment` object. 

To fix the error, you can change the `:key` binding to use a unique identifier from the `comment` object, such as its `id` or `index`. For example:

```html
<div v-for="(comment, index) in comments" :key="index">
```

Or if your `comment` object has a unique `id` property:

```html
<div v-for="comment in comments" :key="comment.id">
```

Using a unique identifier as the key ensures that Vue can efficiently update the DOM when the list of comments changes.
