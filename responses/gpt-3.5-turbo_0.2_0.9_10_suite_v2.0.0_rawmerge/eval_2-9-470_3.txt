This error occurs because the libffi.so.6 library is missing on your system. To fix it, you can follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal and run the following command to install the libffi6 library:

   ```
   sudo apt-get install libffi6
   ```

2. If the above command doesn't work, you can try installing the libffi-dev package instead:

   ```
   sudo apt-get install libffi-dev
   ```

3. After installing the library, you need to rebuild the ffi gem by running the following command:

   ```
   gem pristine ffi
   ```

   This command will rebuild the ffi gem and link it to the newly installed libffi library.

4. Finally, try running your rails command again and it should work without any errors.

I hope this helps!
