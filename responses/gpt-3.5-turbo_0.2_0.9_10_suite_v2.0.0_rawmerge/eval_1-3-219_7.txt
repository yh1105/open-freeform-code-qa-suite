Here are a few things you can try to solve the issue:

1. Make sure that you have installed the latest version of the Python extension for VS Code. You can check for updates by going to the Extensions view (Ctrl+Shift+X) and searching for "Python".

2. Check if the Jupyter Notebook is working outside of VS Code. Open the Anaconda Prompt and type `jupyter notebook`. If it opens successfully, then the issue might be with VS Code.

3. Try changing the Python interpreter in VS Code. Go to the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P) and type "Python: Select Interpreter". Select a different interpreter and try running Jupyter Notebook again.

4. Try creating a new virtual environment and installing Jupyter Notebook in it. Open the Anaconda Prompt and type `conda create --name myenv jupyter`. Activate the new environment by typing `conda activate myenv`. Then, open VS Code and select the new environment as the Python interpreter.

5. If none of the above solutions work, try uninstalling and reinstalling both VS Code and Anaconda. Make sure to delete any leftover files and folders before reinstalling.

Hopefully, one of these solutions will solve your problem.
