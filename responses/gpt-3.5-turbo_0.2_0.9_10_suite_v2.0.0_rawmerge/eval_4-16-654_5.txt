You can add your existing SSH key to Git Bash by following these steps:

1. Open Git Bash and navigate to your home directory by typing `cd ~` in the terminal.
2. Create a new directory called `.ssh` by typing `mkdir .ssh`.
3. Move your SSH key file to the `.ssh` directory by typing `mv /d/keys/id_rsa ~/.ssh/`.
4. Change the permissions of the SSH key file by typing `chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_rsa`.
5. Add the SSH key to the ssh-agent by typing `ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa`.

After completing these steps, you should be able to use your SSH key to clone repositories from remote.
