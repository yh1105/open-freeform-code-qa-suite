You can use the `str.replace()` method of pandas to remove the special characters from the end of each row. Here's the `remove()` function that you can use:

```python
def remove(df):
    df['LGA'] = df['LGA'].str.replace(r'\(.*\)', '').str.strip()
    return df
```

This function first uses the `str.replace()` method to remove all the characters inside the parentheses using a regular expression `r'\(.*\)'`. Then it uses the `str.strip()` method to remove any leading or trailing whitespaces.

You can call this function by passing your pandas DataFrame `df` as an argument:

```python
new_df = remove(df)
print(new_df)
```

This will print the modified DataFrame with the special characters removed from the end of each row.
