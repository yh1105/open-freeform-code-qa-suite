Yes, Flutter provides a widget called `VerticalDivider` that can be used to draw vertical lines between components. 

Here's an example of how to use it:

```
Row(
  children: <Widget>[
    Expanded(
      child: Container(
        height: 100,
        color: Colors.blue,
      ),
    ),
    VerticalDivider(
      color: Colors.grey,
      thickness: 1,
    ),
    Expanded(
      child: Container(
        height: 100,
        color: Colors.green,
      ),
    ),
  ],
)
```

In this example, a `Row` widget is used to display two `Container` widgets with a vertical divider between them. The `VerticalDivider` widget is added between the two `Container` widgets and its `color` and `thickness` properties are set to customize its appearance.
