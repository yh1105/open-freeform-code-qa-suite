This error message indicates that the Firefox browser binary is not found in the default location. You can solve this issue by providing the path to the Firefox binary explicitly.

You can do this by adding the following line of code before creating the `webdriver` object:

```python
from selenium.webdriver.firefox.options import Options
firefox_options = Options()
firefox_options.binary_location = '/path/to/firefox/binary'
browser = webdriver.Firefox(firefox_options=firefox_options)
```

Replace `/path/to/firefox/binary` with the actual path to the Firefox binary on your system.
