The `ERR! code EINTEGRITY` error occurs when the integrity check of the downloaded package fails. This error can be resolved by trying the following measures:

1. Clearing the npm cache: Run `npm cache clean --force` to clear the npm cache and then try running `npm install` again.

2. Updating npm: Run `npm install -g npm@latest` to update npm to the latest version and then try running `npm install` again.

3. Disabling package-lock.json: If you are using npm version 5 or above, try disabling the package-lock.json file by running `npm install --no-package-lock` and then try running `npm install` again.

4. Removing the package-lock.json file: If disabling the package-lock.json file does not work, try removing the file by running `rm package-lock.json` and then try running `npm install` again.

5. Checking network connectivity: Check if there is any issue with your network connectivity that is causing the integrity check to fail. Try running `npm install` on a different network or check if there are any network issues on your current network.

6. Reinstalling Node.js: If none of the above measures work, try reinstalling Node.js and then try running `npm install` again.
