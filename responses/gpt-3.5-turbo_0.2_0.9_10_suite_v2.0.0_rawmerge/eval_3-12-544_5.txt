This error occurs when the `getApplicationDocumentsDirectory()` method returns null. This can happen if the path_provider package is not properly initialized or if there is an issue with the platform-specific implementation of the package.

To fix this, you can try the following steps:

1. Make sure that you have added the path_provider package to your pubspec.yaml file and ran `flutter pub get` to install it.

2. Import the package in your Dart file:
```dart
import 'package:path_provider/path_provider.dart';
```

3. Wrap your code in a `WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized()` block to ensure that the Flutter engine is properly initialized before calling `getApplicationDocumentsDirectory()`:
```dart
void main() async {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  final appDocsDir = await getApplicationDocumentsDirectory();
  Hive.init(appDocsDir.path);
  runApp(MyApp());
}
```

4. If the issue persists, try running `flutter clean` to clear the build cache and then rebuild your app.

If none of these steps work, you can try using a different package or contacting the path_provider package maintainers for further assistance.
