In a .NET 6 Console Application, you can use the `Host` class to build and configure your application. Here's an example of how you can read the `appsettings.json` file:

```c#
using Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting;

var builder = new HostBuilder()
    .ConfigureAppConfiguration((hostingContext, config) =>
    {
        config.AddJsonFile("appsettings.json", optional: true);
    })
    .ConfigureServices((hostContext, services) =>
    {
        // Add your services here
    });

var host = builder.Build();
```

In this example, we're using the `ConfigureAppConfiguration` method to add the `appsettings.json` file to the configuration. We're also using the `ConfigureServices` method to add our services.

You can then use the `host.Services` property to access your services and the `host.Run()` method to start your application.
