The error message indicates that Python is not installed on your system or it is not added to the PATH environment variable. 

To fix this issue, you need to install Python and add it to the PATH environment variable. Here are the steps to follow:

1. Download and install Python from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

2. During the installation process, make sure to select the option to add Python to the PATH environment variable.

3. After the installation is complete, open a new command prompt and run the following command to verify that Python is installed and added to the PATH:

```
python --version
```

4. If the command above returns the Python version, then you have successfully installed and added Python to the PATH.

5. Finally, try to rebuild the Node.js project again and see if the issue is resolved.

If the issue persists, you may need to update node-gyp to the latest version by running the following command:

```
npm install -g node-gyp
```

This will update node-gyp to the latest version and may resolve any compatibility issues with your current version of Node.js.
