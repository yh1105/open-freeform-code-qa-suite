This error occurs because `travis-cli` depends on the `ffi` gem, which requires the `libffi` library to be installed on your system. Here's how you can fix it:

1. Install `libffi` using Homebrew:
   ```
   brew install libffi
   ```

2. Set the `PKG_CONFIG_PATH` environment variable to point to the `libffi` package configuration file:
   ```
   export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/local/opt/libffi/lib/pkgconfig
   ```

3. Try installing `travis` again:
   ```
   gem install travis
   ```

This should resolve the issue and allow you to install `travis-cli`.
