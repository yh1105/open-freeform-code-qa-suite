There are a few things you can try to get the preview canvas to show up in Xcode 11 beta:

1. Make sure you are running Xcode 11 beta on macOS Catalina beta. The preview canvas requires the latest version of macOS to work.

2. Check that you have the latest version of Xcode 11 beta installed. You can check for updates in the App Store.

3. Try cleaning your build folder by going to Product > Clean Build Folder. Then try running the preview again.

4. If none of the above solutions work, try resetting the Xcode preferences by going to Xcode > Preferences > Locations and clicking the "Reset" button next to "Derived Data".

If none of these solutions work, it may be a bug in Xcode 11 beta. You can report the issue to Apple using the Feedback Assistant app.
