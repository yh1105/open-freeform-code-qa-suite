When you set `"sourceMap": false` in your `tsconfig.json` file, it means that the TypeScript compiler will not generate source map files for your application. 

Source maps are files that map the compiled JavaScript code back to the original TypeScript code. They are useful for debugging purposes, as they allow you to see the original TypeScript code in the browser's developer tools instead of the compiled JavaScript code.

If you set `"sourceMap": false`, the browser's developer tools will only show the compiled JavaScript code, which can make debugging more difficult. However, it can also improve the performance of your application, as generating source maps can be a time-consuming process.

So, if you set `"sourceMap": false`, the main change you will notice is that the source map files will not be generated, and the browser's developer tools will only show the compiled JavaScript code.
