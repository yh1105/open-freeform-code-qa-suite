Yes, it is possible to detect if the user's system is in Dark Mode in Safari/Chrome/Firefox by checking the `prefers-color-scheme` media query. 

Here's an example of how to use it in CSS:

```css
@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
  /* styles for dark mode */
}

@media (prefers-color-scheme: light) {
  /* styles for light mode */
}
```

You can also use JavaScript to detect the user's system preference:

```javascript
if (window.matchMedia && window.matchMedia('(prefers-color-scheme: dark)').matches) {
  // user prefers dark mode
} else {
  // user prefers light mode
}
```

Note that not all browsers support the `prefers-color-scheme` media query yet, so you may need to use a polyfill or fallback to a default style if it's not supported.
