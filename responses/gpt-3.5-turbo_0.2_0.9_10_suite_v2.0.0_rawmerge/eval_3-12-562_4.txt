You can use the `add` and `subtract` methods of the `DateTime` class in Dart to add or subtract months/years to/from a date. 

For example, to add 3 months to a date, you can use the following code:

```dart
DateTime date = DateTime.now();
DateTime newDate = date.add(Duration(days: 3 * 30));
```

Similarly, to subtract 2 years from a date, you can use the following code:

```dart
DateTime date = DateTime.now();
DateTime newDate = date.subtract(Duration(days: 2 * 365));
```

Alternatively, you can use the `DateTime` constructor to define the base time and change the day/month/year properties. For example, to add 2 years to a date, you can use the following code:

```dart
DateTime date = DateTime.now();
DateTime newDate = DateTime(date.year + 2, date.month, date.day);
```
