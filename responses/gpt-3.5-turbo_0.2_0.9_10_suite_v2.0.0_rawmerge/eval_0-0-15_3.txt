To mock a class with Jest, you need to return a constructor function that creates an instance of the class. Here's the revised code that should eliminate the error:

```javascript
import API from 'utils/API';

jest.mock('utils/API', () => {
  return jest.fn().mockImplementation(() => {
    return {
      someMethod: () => {}
    };
  });
});

const api = new API();
```

In this code, we're returning a Jest mock function that creates an instance of the class. The `mockImplementation` method is used to define the behavior of the constructor function. In this case, it returns an object with a `someMethod` method. 

With this code, `const api = new API()` should no longer throw a `TypeError`.
