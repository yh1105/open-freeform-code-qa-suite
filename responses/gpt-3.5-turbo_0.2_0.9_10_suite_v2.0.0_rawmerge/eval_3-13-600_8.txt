You can disable the animation in ViewPager2 by setting the `offscreenPageLimit` to 0. This will prevent ViewPager2 from pre-loading adjacent pages and thus disable the animation when switching between pages. Here's an example:

```kotlin
viewPager2.offscreenPageLimit = 0
```

Additionally, you can also set the `isUserInputEnabled` property to false to disable user input for ViewPager2. This will prevent the user from swiping between pages altogether.

```kotlin
viewPager2.isUserInputEnabled = false
```
