For the first question, the "CSRF token mismatch" error could be caused by a few things. One possibility is that the server clock is not synchronized with the client clock, causing the token to expire before it is used. Another possibility is that the session is being regenerated on each request, causing the token to change. You can try setting the `SESSION_DOMAIN` variable in the `.env` file to the domain of your website to ensure that the session is shared across all subdomains. Additionally, you can try increasing the `SESSION_LIFETIME` value to a higher value to ensure that the token does not expire before it is used.

For the second question, the error message suggests that the SSL version being used is incorrect. You can try changing the `MAIL_ENCRYPTION` value to `tls` instead of `ssl`. Additionally, you can try changing the `MAIL_PORT` value to `465` instead of `587`. If these changes do not work, you may need to contact the email provider to ensure that the correct settings are being used.
