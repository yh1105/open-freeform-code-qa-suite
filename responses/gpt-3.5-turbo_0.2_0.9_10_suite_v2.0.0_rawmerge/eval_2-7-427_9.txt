For the first question, the "CSRF token mismatch" error could be caused by a few things. One possibility is that the server's clock is out of sync with the client's clock, causing the token to expire before it should. Another possibility is that there is a caching issue on the server, causing it to serve an outdated token. You could try clearing the cache on the server or disabling caching temporarily to see if that resolves the issue.

As for the multiple sessions being generated, it could be caused by a misconfiguration of the session driver or storage. Make sure that the session driver is set correctly in the .env file and that the storage directory has the correct permissions. You could also try changing the session driver to a different one to see if that resolves the issue.

For the second question, the error message suggests that the SSL version being used is incorrect. Try changing the encryption type to 'tls' instead of 'ssl' in the .env file and see if that resolves the issue. If not, you could try using a different port number or contacting the email server's administrator for assistance.
