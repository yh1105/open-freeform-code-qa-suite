Your code looks correct. However, if the user denies the geolocation permission, the `else` block will not be executed. Instead, an error will be thrown. To handle this error, you can add a second parameter to the `getCurrentPosition` method, which is a function that will be called if there is an error. Here is the revised code:

```javascript
if (navigator.geolocation) {
    navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(position => {
        console.log("Location accessed");
    }, error => {
        console.log("User not allowed");
    });
} else {
    console.log("Geolocation is not supported by this browser.");
}
```

With this code, if the user denies the geolocation permission, the `error` function will be called and "User not allowed" will be logged to the console.
