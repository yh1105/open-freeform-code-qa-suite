One way to make the code more idiomatic is to use the `filter()` method of `Option`. Here's an example:

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut foo: Option<u8> = None;
    if foo.filter(|&x| x < 5).is_none() {
        foo.replace(5);
    }
}
```

This code checks if `foo` is `None` or if its value is less than 5. If either of these conditions is true, it replaces `foo` with `Some(5)`.

Another way to write this code is to use the `unwrap_or_else()` method of `Option`. Here's an example:

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut foo: Option<u8> = None;
    foo = foo.filter(|&x| x < 5).unwrap_or_else(|| Some(5));
}
```

This code does the same thing as the previous example, but it uses `unwrap_or_else()` to replace `foo` with `Some(5)` if it is `None` or if its value is greater than or equal to 5.

Finally, you can also use the `map_or_else()` method of `Option` to achieve the same result. Here's an example:

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut foo: Option<u8> = None;
    foo = foo.map_or_else(|| Some(5), |x| if x < 5 { Some(x) } else { None });
}
```

This code checks if `foo` is `None` or if its value is less than 5. If either of these conditions is true, it replaces `foo` with `Some(5)`. Otherwise, it leaves `foo` unchanged.
