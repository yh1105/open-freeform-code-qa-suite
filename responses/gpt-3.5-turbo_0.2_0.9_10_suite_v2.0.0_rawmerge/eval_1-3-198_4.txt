To read a CSV file from Google Drive, you need to modify the URL of the file. Here's how you can do it:

```python
def processURL(url):
    file_id = url.split('/')[-2]
    csv_url = f'https://drive.google.com/uc?id={file_id}&export=download'
    return csv_url
```

In this function, we first extract the file ID from the URL by splitting the URL and getting the second-to-last element. Then we construct a new URL by appending the file ID to `https://drive.google.com/uc?id=` and adding `&export=download` at the end. This modified URL can be used to read the CSV file using pandas:

```python
import pandas as pd

url = 'https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B6GhBwm5vaB2ekdlZW5WZnppb28/view?usp=sharing'
csv_url = processURL(url)
df = pd.read_csv(csv_url)
``` 

This should read the CSV file from the Google Drive URL and store it in a pandas DataFrame.
