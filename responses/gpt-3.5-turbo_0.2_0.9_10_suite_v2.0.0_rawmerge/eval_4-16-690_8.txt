Starting from macOS Catalina 10.15, the default shell for new user accounts is zsh instead of bash. Therefore, if you are using the default shell, you need to add your environment variables to `~/.zshrc` instead of `~/.bash_profile` or `~/.profile`.

To set the `JBOSS_HOME` environment variable in `~/.zshrc`, you can add the following line to the file:

```
export JBOSS_HOME=/Users/{USERNAME}/Desktop/jboss7
```

Save the file and then run the following command to apply the changes:

```
source ~/.zshrc
```

After that, you should be able to access the `JBOSS_HOME` environment variable in your terminal session.
