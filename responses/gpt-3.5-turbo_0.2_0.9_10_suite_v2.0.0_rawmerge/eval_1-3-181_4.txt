You can use the `numpy.max()` function with the `axis` parameter set to 1 and index the resulting array to get the maximum value of the third column for each 2D array in the original 3D array. Here's the code:

```python
import numpy as np

def getMax(matrix):
    return np.max(matrix[:, :, 2], axis=1).reshape(-1, 1)
```

Here, `matrix[:, :, 2]` selects the third column of each 2D array in the original 3D array, and `np.max()` with `axis=1` calculates the maximum value of each row (i.e., the maximum value of the third column) for each 2D array. Finally, `reshape(-1, 1)` reshapes the resulting 1D array into a 2D array with a single column.
