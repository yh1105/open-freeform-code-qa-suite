You can use the `conda list --show-channel-urls` command to display the package size along with other information such as the channel URL. 

Here's an example of how to use it:

1. Open the Anaconda Prompt or your terminal.
2. Type `conda list --show-channel-urls` and press Enter.
3. Wait for the command to finish executing. This may take a few seconds to a few minutes depending on the number of packages installed.
4. The output will show the package name, version, build, channel URL, and package size in bytes.

You can use this information to identify large packages that you no longer need and remove them using the `conda remove` command.
