You can modify the CSS of Firefox to reduce the spacing between menu items. Here's how:

1. Open Firefox and type `about:config` in the address bar.
2. Search for `toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets` and set it to `true`.
3. Open your Firefox profile folder. You can find the location of your profile folder by typing `about:support` in the address bar and looking for the "Profile Folder" entry.
4. Create a new folder named `chrome` in your profile folder if it doesn't already exist.
5. Inside the `chrome` folder, create a new file named `userChrome.css`.
6. Open the `userChrome.css` file in a text editor and add the following code:

```
/* Reduce spacing between menu items */
#PanelUI-menu .subviewmenu {
  padding-block: 0px !important;
}
```

7. Save the `userChrome.css` file and restart Firefox.

This should reduce the spacing between menu items in Firefox's Proton interface. If you want to further customize the interface, you can modify the CSS in the `userChrome.css` file.
