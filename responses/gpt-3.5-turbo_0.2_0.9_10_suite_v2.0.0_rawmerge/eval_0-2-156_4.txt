To move the Stop button to the top and align it properly with the Begin button, you can add the following CSS code to your `style.css` file:

```css
#GameStopped {
  position: relative;
}

#StartBtn {
  margin-bottom: 20px;
}

#StopBtn {
  position: absolute;
  top: 0;
  left: 0;
}
```

This code will make the `#GameStopped` div position relative, which will allow the `#StopBtn` to be positioned absolutely within it. The `margin-bottom` property on the `#StartBtn` will create some space between the two buttons. Finally, the `top` and `left` properties on the `#StopBtn` will position it at the top left corner of the `#GameStopped` div.
