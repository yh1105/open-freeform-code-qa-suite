You need to add two things to your `~/.zshenv`. First, add the rbenv initialization code itself and second, add the ruby version. Here's what you can do:

1. Open `~/.zshenv` in a text editor.
2. Add the following line at the beginning of the file:
   ```
   export PATH="$HOME/.rbenv/bin:$PATH"
   ```
3. Add the following line after the line you added in step 2:
   ```
   eval "$(rbenv init -)"
   ```
4. Add the following line at the beginning of `~/.zshrc`:
   ```
   source $HOME/.zshenv
   ```
5. Save and close the file.
6. Open a new terminal window or run `source ~/.zshrc` to apply the changes.

You might also run the `rbenv doctor` command to check your installation.
