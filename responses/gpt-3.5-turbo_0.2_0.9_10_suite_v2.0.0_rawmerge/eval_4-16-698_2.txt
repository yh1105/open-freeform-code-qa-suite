In MacOS, you can use the following command to restart your current terminal session without closing the window:

```
source ~/.bash_profile
```

This will reload your `.bash_profile` file and apply any changes you made to it. 

Alternatively, you can use the following command to start a new instance of the terminal emulator:

```
open -a Terminal
```

This will open a new terminal window with a fresh session.
