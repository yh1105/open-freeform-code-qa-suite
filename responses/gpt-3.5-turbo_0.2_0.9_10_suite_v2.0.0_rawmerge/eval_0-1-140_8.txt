With Font Awesome 5, the syntax for calling icons has changed. Instead of using the `font-family` property, you can use the `font-weight` and `font-style` properties to call the specific icon you want.

Here's an example of how you can modify your code to work with Font Awesome 5:

```css
#mainNav .navbar-collapse .navbar-sidenav .nav-link-collapse:after {
  float: right;
  content: "\f107";
  font-weight: 900;
  font-style: normal;
  font-family: "Font Awesome 5 Free";
}
```

In this example, we're using the `font-weight` property to specify the weight of the icon (900 is the weight for solid icons), and the `font-style` property to specify the style of the icon (normal for solid icons). We're also specifying the font family as "Font Awesome 5 Free" to call the correct font.

Make sure you have included the Font Awesome 5 CSS file in your project and that the font files are in the correct directory.
