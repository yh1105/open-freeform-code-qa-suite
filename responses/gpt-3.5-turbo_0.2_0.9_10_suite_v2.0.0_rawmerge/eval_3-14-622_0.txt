To conform to the `ShapeStyle` protocol, you need to implement the `func _apply(to shape: inout _ShapeStyle_Self)` method in your custom view. Here's an example implementation for your `RedView`:

```
struct RedView: ShapeStyle {
    func _apply(to shape: inout ShapeStyle.Shape) {
        shape.fill(Color.red)
    }
}
```

Then you can use it like this:

```
Circle()
    .fill(RedView())
```
