The code you provided should work as expected. However, if the user denies the location permission, the `else` block will not be executed. To handle this case, you can add an error callback to the `getCurrentPosition` method. Here's the revised code:

```javascript
if (navigator.geolocation) {
    navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(
        position => {
            console.log("Location accessed");
        },
        error => {
            console.log("User not allowed");
        }
    );
} else {
    console.log("Geolocation not supported");
}
```

This code will log "User not allowed" if the user denies the location permission, and "Geolocation not supported" if the browser doesn't support geolocation.
