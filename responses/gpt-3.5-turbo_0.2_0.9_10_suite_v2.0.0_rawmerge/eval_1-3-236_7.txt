If the `"python.linting.jediEnabled": false` line is greyed out, it means that it is being overridden by another setting. 

To fix this, you can try the following steps:

1. Open the VS Code settings by clicking on the gear icon in the bottom left corner and selecting "Settings" or by using the shortcut `Ctrl + ,` (Windows) or `Cmd + ,` (Mac).
2. In the search bar at the top of the settings page, type "jedi" to filter the settings related to Jedi.
3. Look for any settings that enable Jedi and disable them. For example, you might see `"python.jediEnabled": true`. Change this to `"python.jediEnabled": false`.
4. Save the changes and try running your linter again.

If you still encounter issues, you can try disabling all Python-related extensions except for the one that provides your linter. This can help to isolate the issue and determine if there is a conflict between extensions.
