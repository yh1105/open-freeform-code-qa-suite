Here's the Python code for the `to_camel_case` function that satisfies the requirements of the Codewars problem:

```python
def to_camel_case(text):
    if not text:
        return ''
    words = re.split(r'[-_]', text)
    return words[0] + ''.join(word.capitalize() for word in words[1:])
```

This function first checks if the input string is empty, and returns an empty string if it is. It then splits the string into words using the regular expression `[-_]`, which matches either a dash or an underscore. The first word is added to the result as is, while the remaining words are capitalized and concatenated to the result. The `join` method is used to combine the capitalized words into a single string.
