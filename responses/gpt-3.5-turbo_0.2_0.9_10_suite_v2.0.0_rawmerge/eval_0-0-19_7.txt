The error message `404 Not Found: aws-sdk-js@latest` suggests that the package `aws-sdk-js` is not found in the npm registry. This could be due to a temporary issue with the registry or the package might have been removed.

You can try running `npm cache clean` to clear the npm cache and then try running `npm install` again. If that doesn't work, you can try specifying a specific version of the package in your `package.json` file, for example:

```
"dependencies": {
  "aws-sdk-js": "2.157.0"
}
```

This will install version 2.157.0 of the `aws-sdk-js` package. You can find the available versions of the package on the npm registry website.
