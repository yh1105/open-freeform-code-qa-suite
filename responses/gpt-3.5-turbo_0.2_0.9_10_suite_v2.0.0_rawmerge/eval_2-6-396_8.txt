The error message is telling you that you cannot create an index on a navigation property, which is what `Gender` is in the `User` entity. To fix this, you need to create an index on the foreign key property `GenderId` instead. 

Replace this line:
```c#
user.HasIndex(x => x.Gender);
```
with this:
```c#
user.HasIndex(x => x.GenderId);
```

This will create an index on the `GenderId` property, which is what you want.
