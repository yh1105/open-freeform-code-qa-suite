TailwindCSS is a utility-first CSS framework, which means it provides pre-defined classes that you can use to style your HTML elements. It does not provide a way to select direct children of a specific class like CSS does.

However, you can use the `@layer` directive in TailwindCSS to create your own custom CSS rules. Here's an example of how you can use it to select direct children of a div with class "section":

```css
@layer components {
  .section > div {
    /* your styles here */
  }
}
```

This will create a new CSS rule in the "components" layer that selects direct children of any element with class "section". You can then use this class in your HTML like this:

```html
<div class="section">
  <div>Direct child 1</div>
  <div>Direct child 2</div>
</div>
```

Note that this approach requires you to use the `@layer` directive and write custom CSS rules, which may not be as convenient as using pre-defined TailwindCSS classes.
