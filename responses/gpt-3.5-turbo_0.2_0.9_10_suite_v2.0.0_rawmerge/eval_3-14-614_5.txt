There are a few things you can try to get the preview canvas to show up in Xcode 11 beta with SwiftUI:

1. Make sure you have the latest version of Xcode 11 beta installed.
2. Check that you have selected the Preview canvas by clicking on the "Resume" button in the top left corner of the Xcode window.
3. Try cleaning your build folder by going to "Product" > "Clean Build Folder" in the Xcode menu.
4. Make sure your ContentView struct conforms to the View protocol.
5. Try restarting Xcode and your computer.

If none of these solutions work, you can try posting your issue on the Apple Developer Forums or filing a bug report with Apple.
