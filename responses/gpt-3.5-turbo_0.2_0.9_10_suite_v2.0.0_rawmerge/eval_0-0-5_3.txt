The error message indicates that Python is not installed on your system or it is not added to the PATH environment variable. 

To fix this issue, you can follow these steps:

1. Install Python 2.7.x from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-2715/
2. During the installation process, make sure to select the option to add Python to the PATH environment variable.
3. After the installation is complete, open a new command prompt and run the following command to verify that Python is installed and added to the PATH: `python --version`
4. If the command returns the Python version number, then it is installed correctly.
5. Try running the Node.js build again and it should work without any issues.

If you still face issues, you can try running the following command to set the PYTHON environment variable to the path where Python is installed:

```
set PYTHON=C:\Python27\python.exe
```

Replace `C:\Python27\python.exe` with the path where Python is installed on your system.

After setting the environment variable, try running the Node.js build again.
