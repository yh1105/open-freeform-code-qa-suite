You can use the `groupby` method to group the DataFrame by column A, and then use the `idxmin` method to get the index of the minimum value in column B for each group. Finally, you can use the `loc` method to select the rows with those indices.

Here's the code:

```python
def getMin(df):
    idx = df.groupby(['A'])['B'].idxmin()
    result = df.loc[idx]
    return result
```

This should give you the desired output.
