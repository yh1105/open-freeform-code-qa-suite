The error message is indicating that the `profile` URL pattern is not able to match the argument passed to it. Looking at your `index.html` file, the issue seems to be with the `post.author.username` value being passed as the argument to the `profile` URL.

The error message indicates that the argument passed to the `profile` URL is `('',)`, which means that the `post.author.username` value is empty or None. This could be because the `author` field of the `NewPost` model is set to `null=True`, which means that it is optional and can be left empty.

To fix this issue, you can add a check in your `index.html` file to only display the author's username if it is not None. Here's an updated version of the relevant part of your `index.html` file:

```html
{% extends "network/layout.html" %}

{% load static %}
{% load crispy_forms_tags %}

{% block body %}
    <div class="form-group">
        <form method="post" action="{% url 'index' %}">
            {% csrf_token %}
            {{form | crispy}}
            <button class="btn btn-primary"> Post </button>
        </form>
    </div>

    {% for post in posts %}
        <div class="card">
            <div class="card-body"> Title: {{post.title}} </div>
            <div class="card-body"> Description: {{post.description}}</div>
            {% if post.author.username %}
                <p> {{post.author.username}} </p>
                <div class="card-body">
                    <a href="{% url 'profile' post.author.username %}">
                        @{{post.author.username}}
                    </a>
                </div>
            {% endif %}
        </div>
    {% endfor %}
{% endblock %}
```

With this change, the author's username and the link to their profile will only be displayed if the `post.author.username` value is not None.
