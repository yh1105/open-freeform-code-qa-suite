In addition to adding the `springdoc-openapi-ui` dependency, you also need to configure it in your Spring Boot application.

Here are the steps to configure `springdoc-openapi-ui` in your Spring Boot application:

1. Add the `@EnableSwagger2WebMvc` annotation to your Spring Boot application class.

```java
@SpringBootApplication
@EnableSwagger2WebMvc
public class YourApplication {
    // ...
}
```

2. Create a `Docket` bean in your Spring Boot application class.

```java
@Bean
public Docket api() {
    return new Docket(DocumentationType.SWAGGER_2)
            .select()
            .apis(RequestHandlerSelectors.basePackage("com.your.package"))
            .paths(PathSelectors.any())
            .build();
}
```

Replace `com.your.package` with the base package of your Spring Boot application.

3. Access the Swagger UI by navigating to `http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html` in your web browser.

If you have followed these steps and still get a 404 error, make sure that your application is running on port 8080 and that there are no conflicting mappings in your application.
