In Rust, the caret operator (`^`) is not used for exponentiation. Instead, you can use the `pow` method provided by the `num_traits` crate. Here's an example:

```rust
use num_traits::pow;

fn main() {
    let base = 2;
    let exponent = 10;
    let result = pow(base, exponent);
    println!("{} raised to the power of {} is {}", base, exponent, result);
}
```

This will output:

```
2 raised to the power of 10 is 1024
```

Note that you need to add the `num_traits` crate to your `Cargo.toml` file to use the `pow` method. Add this line to your `dependencies` section:

```toml
num-traits = "0.2.14"
```

Alternatively, you can use the `pow` method provided by the `std::ops::Mul` trait, which is available for numeric types that implement the `Copy` trait. Here's an example:

```rust
fn main() {
    let base = 2;
    let exponent = 10;
    let result = base.pow(exponent);
    println!("{} raised to the power of {} is {}", base, exponent, result);
}
```

This will output the same result as before.
