The error message is indicating that there is an issue with the argument being passed to the `profile` URL. Specifically, the argument is an empty string `''`. 

The issue is likely in the `index.html` file, where you are passing `post.author.username` as the argument to the `profile` URL. It's possible that some of the `NewPost` objects in your database do not have an author associated with them, which is causing the error.

To fix this, you can add a check to see if the post has an author before trying to display the link to their profile. Here's an updated version of the relevant part of the `index.html` file:

```html
{% extends "network/layout.html" %}

{% load static %}
{% load crispy_forms_tags %}

{% block body %}
    <div class="form-group">
        <form method="post" action="{% url 'index' %}">
            {% csrf_token %}
            {{form | crispy}}
            <button class="btn btn-primary"> Post </button>
        </form>
    </div>

    {% for post in posts %}
        <div class="card">
            <div class="card-body"> Title: {{post.title}} </div>
            <div class="card-body"> Description: {{post.description}}</div>
            {% if post.author %}
                <p> {{post.author.username}} </p>
                <div class="card-body">
                    <a href="{% url 'profile' post.author.username %}">
                        @{{post.author.username}}
                    </a>
                </div>
            {% endif %}
        </div>
    {% endfor %}
{% endblock %}
```

This code checks if the `post.author` attribute exists before trying to display the link to their profile. If it doesn't exist, the link won't be displayed and the error should be avoided.
