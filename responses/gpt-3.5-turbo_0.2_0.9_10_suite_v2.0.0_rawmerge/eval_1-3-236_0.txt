If the `"python.linting.jediEnabled": false` line is greyed out in your `settings.json` file, it means that the setting is being overridden by another setting. 

To fix this, you can try the following steps:

1. Open the Command Palette in VS Code by pressing `Ctrl+Shift+P` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+P` (macOS).
2. Type "Preferences: Open Workspace Settings" and select it.
3. In the "Search settings" box, type "jediEnabled".
4. If there is a setting called "Python â€º Jedi Enabled", set it to false.
5. Save the changes to your workspace settings file.

If this doesn't work, you can also try disabling Jedi in your user settings file. To do this, follow the same steps as above, but select "Preferences: Open User Settings" instead. Then, add the following line to your user settings file:

```
"python.jediEnabled": false
```

Save the changes to your user settings file and restart VS Code. This should disable Jedi and prevent it from interfering with your Pylint linter.
