When you set `"sourceMap": false` in your `tsconfig.json` file, the TypeScript compiler will not generate source map files for your TypeScript code. Source maps are files that map the compiled JavaScript code back to the original TypeScript code, which can be useful for debugging purposes.

If you set `"sourceMap": false`, the generated JavaScript code will not have a corresponding source map file. This means that if you encounter an error in your JavaScript code, you will not be able to easily trace it back to the original TypeScript code.

However, setting `"sourceMap": false` can have some benefits. It can reduce the size of your compiled JavaScript files, as source map files can be quite large. It can also improve the performance of your application, as the browser does not need to download and parse the source map files.

In summary, setting `"sourceMap": false` can be a trade-off between easier debugging and improved performance. It depends on your specific needs and preferences.
