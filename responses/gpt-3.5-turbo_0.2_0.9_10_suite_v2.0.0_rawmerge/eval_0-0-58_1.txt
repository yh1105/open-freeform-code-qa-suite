The `ERR! code EINTEGRITY` error message indicates that the integrity check of the package has failed. This error can occur due to various reasons such as network issues, corrupted cache, or outdated npm version. Here are some possible measures to resolve the issue:

1. Clear the npm cache by running `npm cache clean --force` and then try running `npm install` again.

2. Upgrade your npm version to the latest version by running `npm install -g npm@latest` and then try running `npm install` again.

3. Check your internet connection and try running `npm install` again.

4. If you are using a private registry, try running `npm config set registry https://registry.npmjs.org/` to switch to the public registry and then try running `npm install` again.

5. If none of the above measures work, try deleting the `node_modules` folder and `package-lock.json` file and then run `npm install` again.

6. If you are still facing the issue, try running `npm audit fix` to fix any vulnerabilities in your dependencies and then try running `npm install` again.

7. If none of the above measures work, try deleting the `node_modules` folder, `package-lock.json` file, and `npm-shrinkwrap.json` file and then run `npm install` again.
