It seems that you are having trouble using the SelectByID2 method in SolidWorks API to create a reference plane from a selected face and point. One approach you can try is to create reference points on the selected face and edge to identify the face somehow. Another option is to identify the object name and type to solve the problem. Once you have identified the objects, you can use them with the SelectByID2 method to create the reference plane.
