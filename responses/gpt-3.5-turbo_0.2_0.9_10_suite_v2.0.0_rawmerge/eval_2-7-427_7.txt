For the first issue with the "CSRF token mismatch" error, it seems like the issue is with the session configuration on the host domain. It is possible that the session driver or configuration is different on the host domain compared to your local environment. You can try changing the session driver to something else like database or redis to see if that resolves the issue. Additionally, you can check the server logs to see if there are any errors related to sessions or CSRF tokens.

For the second issue with the email, it seems like the error is related to SSL encryption. The error message "wrong version number" suggests that the SSL version being used is not compatible with the server. You can try changing the encryption type to "tls" instead of "ssl" in your .env file and mail.php configuration file. Additionally, you can try changing the port to 465 instead of 587, as some servers use different ports for SSL encryption. If that doesn't work, you can try contacting the email server provider to see if they have any specific requirements for SSL encryption.
