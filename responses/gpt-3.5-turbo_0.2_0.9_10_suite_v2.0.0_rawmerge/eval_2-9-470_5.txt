The error message indicates that the `libffi.so.6` library is missing. To fix this issue, you can try the following steps:

1. Install the `libffi6` package:
```
sudo apt-get install libffi6
```

2. If the above step doesn't work, you can try creating a symbolic link to the `libffi.so.7` library:
```
sudo ln -s /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libffi.so.7 /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libffi.so.6
```

3. If the above steps don't work, you can try reinstalling the `ffi` gem:
```
gem uninstall ffi
gem install ffi
```

After trying these steps, you should be able to run Rails commands without any issues.
