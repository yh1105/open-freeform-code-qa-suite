This issue might be happening because the Jackson XML library is not included in your project's dependencies. 

To fix this, you can add the following dependency to your `build.gradle` file:

```groovy
implementation 'com.fasterxml.jackson.dataformat:jackson-dataformat-xml'
```

Then, you need to configure your Spring Boot application to use the Jackson XML library for XML serialization and deserialization. You can do this by adding the following configuration to your `application.properties` file:

```properties
spring.jackson.serialization.INDENT_OUTPUT=true
spring.jackson.xml.enabled=true
spring.jackson.xml.prefix=<your-xml-prefix>
spring.jackson.xml.dedent-objects=true
```

Make sure to replace `<your-xml-prefix>` with the prefix you want to use for your XML elements.

After making these changes, you should be able to receive XML responses from your API.
