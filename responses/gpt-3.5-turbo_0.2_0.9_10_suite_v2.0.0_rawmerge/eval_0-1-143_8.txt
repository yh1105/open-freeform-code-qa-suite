You can modify the CSS of Firefox by creating a userChrome.css file. Here are the steps to do it:

1. Open Firefox and type `about:config` in the address bar.
2. Search for `toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets` and set it to `true`.
3. Open your Firefox profile folder. You can find it by typing `about:support` in the address bar and clicking on the "Open Folder" button next to "Profile Folder".
4. Create a new folder called `chrome` if it doesn't exist already.
5. Inside the `chrome` folder, create a new file called `userChrome.css`.
6. Open the `userChrome.css` file with a text editor and add the following code:

```
/* Reduce menu item spacing */
#PanelUI-menu .subviewmenu {
  padding-block: 0 !important;
  margin-block: 0 !important;
}

#PanelUI-menu .subviewmenu .subviewheader {
  padding-block: 0.5em !important;
  margin-block: 0 !important;
}

#PanelUI-menu .subviewmenu .subviewbody {
  padding-block: 0.5em !important;
  margin-block: 0 !important;
}
```

7. Save the `userChrome.css` file and restart Firefox.

This code should reduce the spacing between menu items in Firefox's Proton interface. If you want to further customize the interface, you can inspect the elements using Firefox's built-in developer tools and modify the CSS accordingly.
