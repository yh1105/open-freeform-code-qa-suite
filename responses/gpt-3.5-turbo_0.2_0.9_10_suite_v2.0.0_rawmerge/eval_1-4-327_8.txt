To select the second column with the name "a" in the data frame `d3`, you can use the indexing operator `[ ]` and specify the column number as follows:

```r
second_col <- d3[, "a.1"]
```

Here, we use `[, "a.1"]` to select the second column with the name "a". The ".1" is added to the column name to differentiate it from the first column with the same name. The comma before "a.1" indicates that we want to select all rows of the data frame. 

Now, the selected column is assigned to a new variable named `second_col`.
