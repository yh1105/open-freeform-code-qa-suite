The warning is caused by the null-safety feature in Dart. The value of `myMap[1]` may be null, so its type is `String?` instead of `String`. To solve the warning, you can either change the type of `s` to `String?` or use a null-aware operator like `!` to assert that the value is not null. Here are two solutions:

Solution 1: Change the type of `s` to `String?`
```dart
void foo(Map<int, String> myMap) {
  if (myMap.containsKey(1)) {
    String? s = myMap[1];
  }
}
```

Solution 2: Use a null-aware operator `!` to assert that the value is not null
```dart
void foo(Map<int, String> myMap) {
  if (myMap.containsKey(1)) {
    String s = myMap[1]!;
  }
}
```
