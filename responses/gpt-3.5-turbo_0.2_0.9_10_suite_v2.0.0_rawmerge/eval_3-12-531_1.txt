The warning is caused by the fact that the value returned by `myMap[1]` is nullable (`String?`) because the `containsKey` method only checks if the key exists in the map, but doesn't guarantee that the value associated with the key is not null.

To solve the warning, you can either change the type of the variable `s` to `String?` or use the null-aware operator `!` to assert that the value is not null:

```dart
void foo(Map<int, String> myMap) {
  if (myMap.containsKey(1)) {
    String? s = myMap[1]; // change the type of s to String?
    String s2 = myMap[1]!; // use the null-aware operator !
  }
}
```

Note that if you are not sure whether the value associated with the key is nullable or not, it's safer to use the null-aware operator `!` to avoid runtime errors.
