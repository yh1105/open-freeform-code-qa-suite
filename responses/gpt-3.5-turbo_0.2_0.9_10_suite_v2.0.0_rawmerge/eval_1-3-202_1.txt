It seems like there is an issue with removing the dependencies 'requests' and 'setuptools' from the conda environment. One possible solution is to create a new environment and install the required packages in that environment. You can try the following steps:

1. Open the Anaconda prompt and create a new environment using the following command:

   ```bash
   conda create --name myenv python=3.6
   ```

   This will create a new environment named 'myenv' with Python 3.6 installed.

2. Activate the new environment using the following command:

   ```bash
   conda activate myenv
   ```

3. Install the required packages in the new environment using the following command:

   ```bash
   conda install --file python3.6-environment-windows.yml
   ```

   This will install all the packages listed in the 'python3.6-environment-windows.yml' file in the new environment.

4. Once the installation is complete, you can deactivate the environment using the following command:

   ```bash
   conda deactivate
   ```

   This will deactivate the 'myenv' environment and return you to the base environment.

5. You can now activate the 'myenv' environment whenever you want to use the installed packages using the following command:

   ```bash
   conda activate myenv
   ```

   This will activate the 'myenv' environment and you can use the installed packages in that environment.
