You can use the `jq` command-line tool to minify JSON in a shell script. Here's an example:

```
cat file.json | jq -c .
```

This will read the contents of `file.json`, pipe it to `jq`, and use the `-c` option to output the result in compact mode. The `.` argument tells `jq` to use the default filter, which simply outputs the input JSON as is.

If you want to minify the JSON inline without reading from a file, you can use the following command:

```
echo '{"foo": "lorem", "bar": "ipsum"}' | jq -c .
```

This will output the minified JSON:

```
{"foo":"lorem","bar":"ipsum"}
```
