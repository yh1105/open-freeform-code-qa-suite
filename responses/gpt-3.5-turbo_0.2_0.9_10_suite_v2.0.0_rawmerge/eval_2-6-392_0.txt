Having separate pipelines for specific requests is not necessarily a bad practice. In fact, it can be a good practice to keep the logic for each request separate and organized. 

However, it's important to consider the overall design and architecture of your application. If you have many specific requests, having separate pipelines for each one could become cumbersome and difficult to maintain. In this case, you may want to consider using a more generic pipeline with conditional logic to handle the different requests.

Ultimately, the decision to use separate pipelines or a more generic one depends on the specific requirements and constraints of your application.
