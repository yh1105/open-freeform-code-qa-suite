Sure, here's the function `writeToExcel()` that creates an excel file named "data.xlsx" and writes the contents of the `new_list` variable into the file.

```python
import openpyxl

def writeToExcel():
    new_list = [["first", "second"], ["third", "fourth"]]
    wb = openpyxl.Workbook()
    sheet = wb.active
    for row in new_list:
        sheet.append(row)
    wb.save("data.xlsx")
```

This function uses the `openpyxl` library to create an excel workbook, adds a new sheet to the workbook, and then writes the contents of the `new_list` variable into the sheet. Finally, it saves the workbook as "data.xlsx".
