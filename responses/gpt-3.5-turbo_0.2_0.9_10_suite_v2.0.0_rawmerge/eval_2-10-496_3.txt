You can use the `sort_by` method from the standard library to sort a `Vec` of structs by multiple fields. Here's an example of how to sort `my_vector` by `row` and then by `column`:

```rust
my_vector.sort_by(|a, b| a.row.cmp(&b.row).then(a.column.cmp(&b.column)));
```

This will sort the vector by `row` first, and then by `column` within each `row`. The `then` method is used to specify a secondary comparison to use if the primary comparison (by `row`) returns `Equal`. 

After running this code, `my_vector` will be sorted in the order you specified in your question.
