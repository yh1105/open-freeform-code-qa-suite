The error message indicates that the `profile` URL pattern is expecting a non-empty string argument, but it is receiving an empty string instead. This is likely because the `author` field of the `NewPost` model is set to `null=True`, which means that some posts may not have an associated author.

To fix this error, you can modify the `profile` URL pattern to make the `name` parameter optional by adding a `?` after the `<str:name>` part:

```python
path("profile/<str:name>/", views.profile, name="profile")
```

should be changed to:

```python
path("profile/<str:name>/?", views.profile, name="profile")
```

This will allow the `name` parameter to be optional, so that the `profile` view can handle cases where the `author` field is `null`.

Note that this change may also require you to modify the `profile` view to handle cases where the `name` parameter is empty or `None`.
