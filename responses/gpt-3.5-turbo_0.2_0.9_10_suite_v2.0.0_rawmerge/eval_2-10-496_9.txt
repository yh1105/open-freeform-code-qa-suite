You can use the `sort_by` method on the `Vec` to sort by multiple fields. Here's an example of how you can sort `my_vector` by `row` and then by `column`:

```rust
my_vector.sort_by(|a, b| a.row.cmp(&b.row).then(a.column.cmp(&b.column)));
```

This will sort the vector in ascending order by `row`, and then by `column` within each `row`. If you want to sort in descending order, you can use `rev` on the `cmp` method like this:

```rust
my_vector.sort_by(|a, b| b.row.cmp(&a.row).then(b.column.cmp(&a.column)));
```

This will sort the vector in descending order by `row`, and then by `column` within each `row`.
