The Rule of 5 is not outdated, as it is still relevant in modern C++ programming. While it is true that implicit constructors and destructors work fine for aggregate data structures, there are cases where you need to manage resources explicitly, such as when dealing with dynamic memory allocation or file I/O.

Smart pointers can certainly help manage resources, but they are not always the best solution. For example, if you need to manage a resource that is not memory, such as a network connection or a file handle, smart pointers may not be suitable. Additionally, smart pointers can introduce overhead and complexity, especially in multi-threaded environments.

In summary, while the Rule of 5 may not be necessary for all classes, it is still important to understand and apply it when dealing with resource management in C++.
