You can use `router.reload()` to trigger a client-side reload in Next.js. Here's the updated code:

```javascript
import { useRouter } from "next/navigation";

export default function Component(){
    const router = useRouter();

    const handleCreate = () => {
        // logic to create new data
        router.reload();
    }

    return (
        // your component code here
    )
}
``` 

In this example, `handleCreate` is a function that is called when the user creates new data. After the data is created, `router.reload()` is called to trigger a client-side reload of the current page.
