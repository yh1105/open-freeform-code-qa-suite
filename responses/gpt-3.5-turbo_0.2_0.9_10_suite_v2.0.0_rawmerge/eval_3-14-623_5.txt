This error usually occurs when there is a problem with the Swift compiler. Here are some steps you can try to resolve the issue:

1. Clean the project: Go to Product > Clean in Xcode. This will clean all the build files and derived data.

2. Delete the derived data: Go to Xcode Preferences > Locations > Derived Data and delete the derived data for your project.

3. Update CocoaPods: Run `pod update` in the terminal to update all the pods to their latest version.

4. Update Swift version: Make sure that your project is using the latest Swift version. You can check this in the Build Settings of your project.

5. Check for any errors in the code: Look for any errors in your code that might be causing the issue. Fix them and try building the project again.

6. Try disabling the "Parallelize Build" option: Go to File > Project/Workspace Settings > Build System and select "Legacy Build System". Then try building the project again.

If none of these steps work, you can try resetting Xcode by deleting the Xcode preferences file. You can do this by running the following command in the terminal:

```
defaults delete com.apple.dt.Xcode
```

Note: This will reset all your Xcode preferences to their default values.
