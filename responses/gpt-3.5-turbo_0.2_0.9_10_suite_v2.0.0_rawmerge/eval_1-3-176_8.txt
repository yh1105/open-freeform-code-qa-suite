The error message indicates that the headers or library files for zlib are missing, which is a required dependency for Pillow. You can try installing zlib first and then installing Pillow again. Here are the steps to install zlib:

1. Download the zlib source code from the official website: https://www.zlib.net/
2. Extract the downloaded file to a directory of your choice.
3. Open a command prompt and navigate to the directory where you extracted the zlib source code.
4. Run the following commands:

   ```bash
   ./configure
   make
   make install
   ```

   Note: If you are using Windows, you may need to use a different command to configure zlib. Please refer to the zlib documentation for more information.

5. After installing zlib, try installing Pillow again using `pip install pillow`.

If the above steps do not work, you can try installing Pillow using a pre-built binary. You can download the appropriate binary for your system from the Pillow website: https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installation.html#binary-installation.
