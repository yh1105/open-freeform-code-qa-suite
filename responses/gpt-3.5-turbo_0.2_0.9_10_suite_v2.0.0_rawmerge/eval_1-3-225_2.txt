Here's the revised code for the `pig_latin` function:

```python
def pig_latin(text):
    words = text.split()
    pig_latin_words = []
    for word in words:
        endString = word[1:].lower()
        startString = word[0].lower()
        pig_latin_words.append(endString + startString + "ay")
    return " ".join(pig_latin_words)
```

In this revised code, we first split the input text into individual words using the `split()` method. We then iterate over each word and apply the pig Latin transformation by moving the first character to the end of the word and appending "ay". We then append the transformed word to a list of pig Latin words. Finally, we join the list of pig Latin words back into a string using the `join()` method and return the result.

Note that we also changed the variable name `them` to `pig_latin_words` to make the code more readable.
