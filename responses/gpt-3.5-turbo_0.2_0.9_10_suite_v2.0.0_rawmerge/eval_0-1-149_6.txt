To create an animation after hovering over the link using Tailwind CSS, you can use the `group-hover` variant and the `transform` property. Here's an example code snippet:

```html
<a href="#" class="group text-sky-600 transition duration-300 relative">
    Link
    <span class="block max-w-0 duration-500 h-0.5 bg-sky-600 absolute bottom-0 left-0"></span>
    <span class="block max-w-0 duration-500 h-0.5 bg-sky-600 absolute bottom-0 right-0"></span>
</a>
```

In this code, we have added two `span` elements with a `max-width` of 0 and a `height` of 0.5, which will act as the animation bars. We have also added the `relative` class to the `a` element to make the `span` elements position themselves relative to the `a` element.

To animate these bars, we can use the `group-hover` variant and the `transform` property. Here's the CSS code to achieve this:

```css
.group:hover .block:nth-child(1) {
    transform: translateX(100%);
}

.group:hover .block:nth-child(2) {
    transform: translateX(-100%);
}
```

This code will translate the first `span` element to the right and the second `span` element to the left when the `a` element is hovered over.

Note that we have used the `nth-child` selector to target the individual `span` elements. Also, we have added the `transition` property to the `a` element to make the animation smoother.

I hope this helps!
