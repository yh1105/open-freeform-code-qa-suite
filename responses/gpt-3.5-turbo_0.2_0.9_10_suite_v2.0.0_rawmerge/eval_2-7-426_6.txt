The "CSRF token mismatch" error occurs when the CSRF token generated by the server does not match the one sent by the client. This can happen due to a number of reasons, including session issues.

In your case, it seems that multiple sessions are being generated for a single user, and none of them contain the CSRF token generated by the browser. This could be due to a misconfiguration of the session driver or the session settings on the host domain.

Here are some steps you can take to troubleshoot the issue:

1. Check the session driver and settings on the host domain: Make sure that the session driver and settings on the host domain are the same as those on your local environment. Check the values of SESSION_DRIVER, SESSION_LIFETIME, and other related settings in the .env file on the host domain.

2. Clear the session cache: Clear the session cache on the host domain by deleting the files in the storage/framework/sessions directory. This will ensure that any old or invalid sessions are removed.

3. Check the session ID: Check the session ID being used by the server and the client. Make sure that they are the same. You can do this by inspecting the cookies in the browser and the session ID in the session files on the host domain.

4. Check the CSRF token generation: Check the code that generates the CSRF token on the server. Make sure that it is generating the token correctly and that it is being included in the response headers.

5. Check for any middleware issues: Check if there are any middleware that are interfering with the session or CSRF token generation. Disable any middleware that may be causing issues and test the application again.
