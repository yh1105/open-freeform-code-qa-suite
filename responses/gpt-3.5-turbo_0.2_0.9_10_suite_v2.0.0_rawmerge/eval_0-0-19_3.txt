The error message `404 Not Found: aws-sdk-js@latest` suggests that the package `aws-sdk-js` could not be found in the registry. This could be due to a temporary issue with the registry or a problem with your internet connection.

You can try the following steps to resolve the issue:

1. Check your internet connection and try again.
2. Clear the npm cache by running `npm cache clean --force` and then try again.
3. Try installing a different package to see if the issue is specific to `aws-sdk-js`. For example, try running `npm install express`.
4. If the issue persists, try switching to a different registry by running `npm config set registry https://registry.npmjs.org/` and then try again.

If none of these steps work, you can try updating npm to the latest version by running `npm install -g npm` and then try again.
