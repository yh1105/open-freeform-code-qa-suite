The error message indicates that the `Keys` table is missing in the database. You can try the following steps to solve the problem:

1. Make sure that the database is up to date with the latest migrations. You can run the following command in the Package Manager Console to apply any pending migrations:

   ```
   Update-Database
   ```

2. If the `Update-Database` command doesn't solve the problem, you can try dropping the database and creating a new one. To do this, run the following commands in the Package Manager Console:

   ```
   Drop-Database
   Create-Database
   Update-Database
   ```

   Note that this will delete all data in the database, so make sure to backup any important data before running these commands.

3. If the problem still persists, you can try checking the `Keys` table definition in the database. Make sure that the table exists and has the correct columns and data types. You can use a tool like SQLiteStudio to inspect the database.

4. If none of the above steps work, you can try rolling back to the previous version of ASP.NET Core and IdentityServer4, or contacting the IdentityServer4 support team for further assistance.
