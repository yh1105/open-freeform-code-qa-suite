In Rust, the caret operator (`^`) is not used for exponentiation. Instead, you can use the `pow` method that is available on the `num::Integer` trait. Here is an example:

```rust
use num::Integer;

fn main() {
    let base = 2;
    let exponent = 10;
    let result = base.pow(exponent);
    println!("{} raised to the power of {} is {}", base, exponent, result);
}
```

This will output:

```
2 raised to the power of 10 is 1024
```

In this example, we import the `num::Integer` trait, which provides the `pow` method. We then call the `pow` method on the base integer with the exponent as an argument. The result is the base raised to the power of the exponent.
