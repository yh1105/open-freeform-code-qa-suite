The `ext-zip` package is not a regular package that can be installed via Composer. It is an extension that needs to be installed on the server where PHP is running. 

To install the `ext-zip` extension, you need to follow these steps:

1. Check if the extension is already installed by running the following command in your terminal:
```
php -m | grep zip
```
If the output shows `zip`, then the extension is already installed.

2. If the extension is not installed, you need to install it. The installation process depends on your operating system and the PHP version you are using. Here are some examples:

- For Ubuntu and PHP 7.4, you can run the following command:
```
sudo apt-get install php7.4-zip
```

- For macOS and PHP 7.4, you can run the following command:
```
brew install php@7.4
```
Then, add the following line to your `php.ini` file:
```
extension=zip
```

- For Windows and PHP 7.4, you can uncomment the following line in your `php.ini` file:
```
;extension=zip
```
and change it to:
```
extension=zip
```

3. After installing the extension, restart your web server and try running the `composer require ext-zip` command again. It should work now.

Note: If you are using a different PHP version or operating system, you need to adjust the installation steps accordingly.
