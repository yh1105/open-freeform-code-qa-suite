This error usually occurs when there is an issue with the build settings or the script used in the build phase. Here are some steps you can try to resolve the issue:

1. Check the build settings: Make sure that the build settings are correct and all the required frameworks and libraries are added to the project. Also, check if the correct version of Xcode is being used.

2. Clean the project: Clean the project by going to Product > Clean Build Folder. This will delete all the intermediate files and derived data.

3. Check the script: Check the script used in the build phase and make sure that it is correct. You can also try removing the script and see if the project builds successfully.

4. Update the pods: Update the pods by running `pod update` in the terminal. This will update all the pods to the latest version.

5. Reinstall the pods: Reinstall the pods by running `pod install` in the terminal. This will reinstall all the pods and their dependencies.

6. Check for any missing files: Check if any files are missing or have been deleted from the project. If so, add them back to the project.

7. Check for any conflicts: Check if there are any conflicts between the pods and the project. If so, try removing the conflicting pods and see if the project builds successfully.

8. Try a different version of Xcode: Try building the project with a different version of Xcode and see if the issue persists.

If none of the above steps work, you can try reaching out to the library developers for support or seek help from the Xcode community.
