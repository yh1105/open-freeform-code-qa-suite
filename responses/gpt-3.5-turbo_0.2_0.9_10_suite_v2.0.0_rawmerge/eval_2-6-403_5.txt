You can use the `JsonResult` class to return JSON with a specific HTTP status code in your .NET Core Web API controller. Here's an example:

```c#
public JsonResult IsAuthenticated()
{
    return new JsonResult("123")
    {
        StatusCode = 200
    };
}
```

In this example, we're creating a new `JsonResult` object with the JSON data we want to return ("123"). We're then setting the `StatusCode` property of the `JsonResult` object to 200 (OK). This will ensure that the response from the server includes the correct HTTP status code.

Note that we're using `JsonResult` instead of `ActionResult` because `JsonResult` allows us to set the HTTP status code directly. If you need to return other types of data (such as a view), you can use `ActionResult` instead.
