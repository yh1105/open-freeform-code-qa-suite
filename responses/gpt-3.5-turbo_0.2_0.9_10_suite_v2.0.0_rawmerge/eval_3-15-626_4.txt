You can use the `WorkbookConnection` object in VBA to automate a Power Query. Here's an example code snippet:

```
Sub RefreshPowerQuery()
    Dim conn As WorkbookConnection
    Set conn = ThisWorkbook.Connections("Query - MyQueryName") 'Change "MyQueryName" to the name of your query
    conn.Refresh
End Sub
```

You can modify this code to load the results to a specific worksheet by adding a `ListObject` and setting its `SourceType` to `xlSrcExternal` and its `Source` to the name of the connection.
