This error message usually indicates that the file system is mounted as read-only, which means that you cannot write to it. 

To resolve this issue, you can try the following steps:

1. Check the file system's read/write status by running the following command in the terminal:

   ```
   mount | grep ' / '
   ```

   This will display the file system's mount options. Look for the "read-only" option. If it is present, the file system is mounted as read-only.

2. Remount the file system as read-write by running the following command:

   ```
   sudo mount -uw /
   ```

   This will remount the file system as read-write.

3. Try creating the directory again:

   ```
   sudo mkdir -p /data/db
   ```

   This should create the directory without any issues.

If the above steps do not work, it is possible that there is an issue with the file system itself. In that case, you may need to run a file system check or repair tool to fix any errors.
