You can use the `iter()` method to create an iterator over the vector, and then use the `min()` method to get the minimum value. Here's an example:

```rust
let v = vec![5, 6, 8, 4, 2, 7];
let min_value = *v.iter().min().unwrap();
println!("Minimum value: {}", min_value);
```

In this example, we use the `iter()` method to create an iterator over the vector `v`. Then, we use the `min()` method to get the minimum value from the iterator. Finally, we use the `unwrap()` method to get the value out of the `Option<i32>` that `min()` returns, and then use the `*` operator to dereference the resulting `&i32` and get the actual minimum value.

Note that if the vector is empty, the `min()` method will return `None`, so you should handle that case appropriately.
