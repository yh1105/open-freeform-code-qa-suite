The error message `HTTP Error 410: Gone` indicates that the video you are trying to download is no longer available on YouTube. This could be due to various reasons such as the video being removed by the uploader, or the video being age-restricted or blocked in your region.

You can try to download a different video to see if the issue persists. If the issue persists, you can try using a different library such as `pafy` or `youtube_dl` to download YouTube videos. 

Here is an example code using `pafy` library to download a YouTube video:

```python
import pafy

# ask for the link from user
link = input("Enter the link of YouTube video you want to download: ")

# create a pafy object
video = pafy.new(link)

# get the best available stream
best = video.getbest()

# start the download
print("Downloading...")
best.download()
print("Download completed!!")
``` 

Make sure to install the `pafy` library using `pip install pafy`.
