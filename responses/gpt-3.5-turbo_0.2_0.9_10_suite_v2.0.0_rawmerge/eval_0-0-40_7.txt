The error message you are seeing indicates that there is an issue with the line endings in the `npm` file. This is a common issue when working with files that were created on Windows and then used in a Linux environment.

To fix this issue, you can try the following steps:

1. Open the `npm` file in a text editor that supports Unix-style line endings (such as VS Code).
2. Change the line endings from Windows-style (`\r\n`) to Unix-style (`\n`).
3. Save the file and try running `npm -v` again.

If this does not work, you can try reinstalling `npm` using the following command:

```
sudo apt-get install -y npm
```

This should install the latest version of `npm` and set it up correctly.
