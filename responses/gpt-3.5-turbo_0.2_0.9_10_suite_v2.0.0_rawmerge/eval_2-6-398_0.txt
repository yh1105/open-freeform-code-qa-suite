Make sure that you are passing the `ILogger` instance to the constructor of `MyClass`. You can do this by registering `MyClass` with the `ServiceCollection` like so:
```c#
var services = new ServiceCollection()
    .AddLogging(logging => logging.AddConsole())
    .AddTransient<MyClass>()
    .BuildServiceProvider();
```
This will ensure that an instance of `MyClass` is created with the correct dependencies, including the `ILogger` instance.
