The error message you are receiving is related to the `join_axes` parameter, which was deprecated in Pandas 0.25 and removed in Pandas 1.0. The `pandas-profiling` package is not yet fully compatible with Pandas 1.0, so you may encounter some issues when using it.

One possible solution is to downgrade your Pandas version to 0.25 or earlier. You can do this by running the following command in your Anaconda prompt:

```
conda install pandas=0.25
```

Alternatively, you can try using an older version of `pandas-profiling` that is compatible with Pandas 1.0. You can install a specific version of the package by running the following command:

```
pip install pandas-profiling==2.6.0
```

Once you have installed the compatible version of Pandas or `pandas-profiling`, you should be able to generate the profile report using the following code:

```python
import pandas_profiling

profile = pandas_profiling.ProfileReport(data)
profile.to_widgets()
```

This will open a widget in your Jupyter notebook that displays the profile report.
