The `ERR! code EINTEGRITY` error occurs when the integrity check of the package fails. This error can be resolved by following these steps:

1. Clear the npm cache by running `npm cache clean --force`.
2. Delete the `node_modules` folder and `package-lock.json` file.
3. Run `npm install` again.

If the above steps do not work, you can try the following:

1. Update npm to the latest version by running `npm install -g npm`.
2. Try installing the package with the `--no-optional` flag.
3. If you are using a private registry, make sure it is up to date and accessible.
4. If you are using a proxy, make sure it is configured correctly.

If none of the above steps work, you can try deleting the `node_modules` folder and `package-lock.json` file, and then running `npm install --force`. However, this should be used as a last resort as it can cause issues with dependencies.
