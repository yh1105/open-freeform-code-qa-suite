To add Jetpack Compose to an existing Android Studio project, you need to make sure that your project is using Android Gradle Plugin version 7.0.0 or higher. Then, you can add the following dependencies to your app-level build.gradle file:

```
dependencies {
    implementation 'androidx.core:core-ktx:1.6.0'
    implementation 'androidx.appcompat:appcompat:1.3.1'
    implementation 'androidx.activity:activity-compose:1.3.1'
    implementation 'androidx.compose.ui:ui:1.0.1'
    implementation 'androidx.compose.material:material:1.0.1'
    implementation 'androidx.compose.runtime:runtime-livedata:1.0.1'
}
```

After adding these dependencies, you can start using Jetpack Compose in your existing project. You can create Composable functions and use them in your existing activities or fragments. Make sure to also update your layout files to use the `setContent` method instead of the traditional `setContentView` method.
