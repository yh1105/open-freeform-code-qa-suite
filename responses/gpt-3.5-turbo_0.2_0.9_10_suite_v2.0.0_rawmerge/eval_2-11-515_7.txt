```c++
vector<pair<int, int>> origin_to_goal(vector<int> origin) {
    vector<pair<int, int>> goal;
    auto it = origin.begin();
    while (it != origin.end()) {
        goal.emplace_back(*it, *(it + 1));
        it += 2;
    }
    return goal;
}
```
This implementation uses the `emplace_back` function to create a new pair in the `goal` vector with the two elements pointed by the iterator `it` and `it+1`. The iterator is incremented by 2 at each iteration to skip the already processed elements.
