The error message you are getting suggests that the `join_axes` parameter is not supported in the version of Pandas you are using. This parameter was deprecated in Pandas 0.25 and removed in Pandas 1.0.

To solve this problem, you can try upgrading your pandas-profiling package to the latest version. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal or Anaconda prompt:

```
conda update pandas-profiling
```

Alternatively, you can try specifying the version of pandas-profiling that is compatible with your version of Pandas. For example, if you are using Pandas 1.0, you can try installing pandas-profiling version 2.8.0, which is compatible with Pandas 1.0. You can do this by running the following command:

```
conda install pandas-profiling=2.8.0
```

Once you have upgraded pandas-profiling or installed a compatible version, you can try running your code again:

```python
import pandas_profiling
from pandas_profiling import ProfileReport

profile = ProfileReport(data)
```

or

```python
profile = pandas_profiling.ProfileReport(data)
```

If you still encounter issues, you can try updating your Pandas package to the latest version by running the following command:

```
conda update pandas
```

This should ensure that you have the latest version of Pandas with all the necessary dependencies.
