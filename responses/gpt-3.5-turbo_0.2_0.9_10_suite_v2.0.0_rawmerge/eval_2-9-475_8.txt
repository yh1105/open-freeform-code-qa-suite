This error occurs because the `libffi` package is not installed on your macOS system. You can install it using Homebrew, which is a package manager for macOS.

To install Homebrew, open the Terminal app and run the following command:

```
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

Once Homebrew is installed, run the following command to install `libffi`:

```
brew install libffi
```

After `libffi` is installed, you should be able to install `travis` without any issues using the command:

```
gem install travis
```

I hope this helps!
