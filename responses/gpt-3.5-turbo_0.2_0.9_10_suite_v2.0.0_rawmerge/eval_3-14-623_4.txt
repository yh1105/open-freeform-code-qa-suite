This error message usually indicates that there is a problem with the Swift code in your project. Here are some steps you can try to resolve the issue:

1. Clean your project: Go to Product > Clean Build Folder in Xcode. This will delete all the intermediate build files and force Xcode to rebuild everything from scratch.

2. Update your pods: Make sure you have the latest version of CocoaPods installed (`sudo gem install cocoapods`). Then, run `pod update` in your project directory to update all your pods to the latest version.

3. Check for errors in your code: Look for any syntax errors or other issues in your Swift code. Xcode should highlight any errors in red.

4. Check for conflicting pods: Sometimes, two or more pods can have conflicting dependencies. Try removing one or more pods to see if that resolves the issue.

5. Check for missing frameworks: Make sure all the required frameworks are included in your project. You can check this by going to your project settings, selecting your target, and going to the "General" tab. Under "Frameworks, Libraries, and Embedded Content", make sure all the required frameworks are listed and set to "Embed & Sign".

6. Check for outdated pods: If you're using an older version of a pod that hasn't been updated for Xcode 10, it may not be compatible. Try updating to the latest version of the pod or finding an alternative.

If none of these steps work, you may need to dig deeper into the error messages to find the root cause of the issue. You can try running `pod install` with the `--verbose` flag to get more detailed output, or check the Xcode console for any error messages.
