The error message suggests that there is an issue with loading the `_psycopg` module, which is a C extension module that is part of the `psycopg2` package. This error can occur if the C extension module is not compatible with the Python interpreter that you are using.

One possible solution is to install `psycopg2-binary` instead of `psycopg2`. `psycopg2-binary` is a pre-built package that includes the C extension module, so you don't need to compile it yourself. You can install it using the following command:

```
conda install psycopg2-binary
```

Then, modify your code to import `psycopg2` from `psycopg2-binary`:

```python
import psycopg2
```

If this doesn't work, you can try installing `psycopg2` using `pip` instead of `conda`:

```
pip install psycopg2-binary
```

If you still encounter the same error, you may need to check if your Python interpreter and `psycopg2` package are both 32-bit or 64-bit. They should be of the same bitness.
