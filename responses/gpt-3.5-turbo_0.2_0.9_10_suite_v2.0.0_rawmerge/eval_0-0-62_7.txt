The error message is telling you that you should use a string or a number as the key for your `v-for` loop instead of using the entire `comment` object. 

To fix the error, you can change the `:key` binding to use a unique identifier for each comment, such as the `comment.id` property. Here's an example:

```html
<div v-for="comment in comments" :key="comment.id">
```

This will ensure that each comment is uniquely identified and avoid the warning message.
