This error occurs because the `reference` method was removed from `ActiveSupport::Dependencies` in Rails 6.0. To fix this error, you need to upgrade your Devise gem to version 4.8.1 or higher, which includes a fix for this issue.

To upgrade Devise, you can update your Gemfile to specify the latest version:

```
gem 'devise', '~> 4.8.1'
```

Then run `bundle update devise` to update the gem.

If you still encounter the same error after upgrading Devise, you may need to upgrade your Rails version to 6.0 or higher.
