To transfer native SOL directly into the event account's vault address in an anchor smart contract instruction, you can use the following code:

```
let ix = anchor_lang::solana_program::system_instruction::transfer(
    &ctx.accounts.from.to_account_info().key,
    &ctx.accounts.to.to_account_info().key,
    amount,
);
anchor_lang::solana_program::program::invoke(
    &ix,
    &[
        ctx.accounts.from.to_account_info(),
        ctx.accounts.to.to_account_info(),
    ],
)?;
```

In this code, `ctx.accounts.from` is the account that is sending the SOL, and `ctx.accounts.to` is the event account's vault address. The `to_account_info()` method is used to get the account's address as a `AccountInfo` struct, which is required by the `invoke` function. The `amount` variable is the amount of SOL being transferred.
