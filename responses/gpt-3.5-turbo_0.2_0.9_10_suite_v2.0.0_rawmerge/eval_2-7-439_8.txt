The `ext-zip` package is not a regular package that can be installed via Composer. It is actually a PHP extension that needs to be installed on your server. 

To install the `ext-zip` extension, you need to follow these steps:

1. Check if the extension is already installed by running the following command in your terminal:
```
php -m | grep zip
```
If the output contains `zip`, then the extension is already installed.

2. If the extension is not installed, you need to install it. The installation process depends on your operating system and the web server you are using. Here are some examples:

- For Ubuntu and Apache, you can install the extension by running the following command:
```
sudo apt-get install php-zip
```

- For CentOS and Apache, you can install the extension by running the following command:
```
sudo yum install php-zip
```

- For macOS and Apache, you can install the extension by uncommenting the following line in your `php.ini` file:
```
;extension=zip
```
Then, restart Apache by running the following command:
```
sudo apachectl restart
```

3. After installing the extension, run the `php -m | grep zip` command again to make sure the extension is now installed.

4. Finally, you can remove the `ext-zip` requirement from your `composer.json` file and run `composer update` to update your dependencies.

I hope this helps!
