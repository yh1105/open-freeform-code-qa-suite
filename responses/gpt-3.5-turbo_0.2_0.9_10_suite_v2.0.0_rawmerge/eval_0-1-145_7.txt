The `truncate` class in TailwindCSS only works if the element has a fixed width or is inside an element with a fixed width. In your code, the `span` element with the `truncate` class does not have a fixed width, so the text is not being truncated.

To fix this, you can either give the `span` element a fixed width or wrap it in an element with a fixed width. Here's an example of how you can give the `span` element a fixed width:

```html
<div class="ml-1 inline-block">
   <span>Label: </span>
   <span class="font-semibold truncate w-40">
     long texttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttt
   </span>
</div>
```

In this example, the `w-40` class gives the `span` element a fixed width of 40 units. You can adjust the width to fit your needs.

Alternatively, you can wrap the `span` element in a container with a fixed width:

```html
<div class="ml-1 inline-block">
   <span>Label: </span>
   <div class="w-40">
     <span class="font-semibold truncate">
       long texttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttt
     </span>
   </div>
</div>
```

In this example, the `div` element with the `w-40` class has a fixed width of 40 units and contains the `span` element with the `truncate` class. Again, you can adjust the width to fit your needs.
