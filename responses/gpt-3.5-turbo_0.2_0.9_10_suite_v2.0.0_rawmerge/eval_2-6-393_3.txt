The error is occurring because you are trying to create an index on the `Gender` property of the `User` entity, but it is configured as a navigation property. Navigation properties are used to define relationships between entities, and cannot be used as regular properties.

To fix the error, you can remove the line `user.HasIndex(x => x.Gender);` from your `OnModelCreating` method. This will remove the index on the `Gender` property, but the relationship between `User` and `Gender` will still be defined through the `GenderId` foreign key.
