To enable developer mode on iOS 16.0, follow these steps:

1. Open the "Settings" app on your iOS device.
2. Scroll down and tap on "Developer".
3. Toggle the switch next to "Developer Mode" to the "On" position.
4. You may be prompted to enter your device passcode or Apple ID password to confirm the change.
5. Once developer mode is enabled, you should be able to run the provisioned testing build without any issues.

Note: If you do not see the "Developer" option in your Settings app, it may be hidden. To unhide it, go to "Settings" > "General" > "About" and tap on the "Name" field at the top of the screen several times until the "Developer" option appears.
