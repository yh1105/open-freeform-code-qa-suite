To remove the spaces from the output, you can modify the code to replace the space character with an empty string. Here's the modified code:

```
Sub ReplaceSpecial()
    Dim cel As Range
    Dim strVal As String
    Dim i As Long
    Application.ScreenUpdating = False
    For Each cel In Selection
        strVal = cel.Value
        For i = 1 To Len(strVal)
            Select Case Asc(Mid(strVal, i, 1))
                Case 32, 48 To 57, 65 To 90, 97 To 122
                    ' Leave ordinary characters alone
                Case Else
                    Mid(strVal, i, 1) = " "
            End Select
        Next i
        ' Replace space character with empty string
        cel.Value = Replace(strVal, " ", "")
    Next cel
    Application.ScreenUpdating = True
End Sub
```

This code will replace all the space characters with an empty string, resulting in the output `abc123245`.
