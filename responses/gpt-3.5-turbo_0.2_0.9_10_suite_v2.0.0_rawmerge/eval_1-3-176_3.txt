The error message suggests that the headers or library files for zlib are missing, which is a required dependency for Pillow. You can try installing zlib first and then install Pillow again. 

To install zlib, you can use the following command:

```bash
pip install zlib
```

After installing zlib, try installing Pillow again using the following command:

```bash
pip install pillow
```

If the above solution doesn't work, you can try installing Pillow from a pre-built binary wheel file. You can download the appropriate wheel file for your system from the following link: https://pypi.org/project/Pillow/#files

Once you have downloaded the wheel file, you can install it using the following command:

```bash
pip install <path-to-wheel-file>
```

Replace `<path-to-wheel-file>` with the actual path to the downloaded wheel file.

I hope this helps!
