The error message suggests that the `join_axes` argument is not supported in the version of Pandas you are using. This argument was deprecated in Pandas 0.25 and removed in Pandas 1.0.

To solve this problem, you can try upgrading pandas-profiling to the latest version, which should be compatible with Pandas 1.0. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal or Anaconda prompt:

```
pip install pandas-profiling --upgrade
```

After upgrading, try running your code again:

```python
import pandas_profiling
from pandas_profiling import ProfileReport

profile = ProfileReport(data)
```

If this still doesn't work, you can try specifying the version of pandas-profiling that is compatible with your version of Pandas. For example, if you are using Pandas 1.0, you can try installing pandas-profiling version 2.8.0:

```
pip install pandas-profiling==2.8.0
```

Then, try running your code again.
