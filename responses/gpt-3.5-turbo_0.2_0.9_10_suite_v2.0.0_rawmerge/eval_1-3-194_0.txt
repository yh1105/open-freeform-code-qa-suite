To write a list of lists into an Excel file, we can use the `openpyxl` library in Python. Here is the implementation of the `writeToExcel` function:

```python
import openpyxl

def writeToExcel():
    # Create a new workbook
    wb = openpyxl.Workbook()

    # Select the active worksheet
    ws = wb.active

    # Define the data to be written
    new_list = [["first", "second"], ["third", "fourth"]]

    # Write the data to the worksheet
    for row in new_list:
        ws.append(row)

    # Save the workbook
    wb.save("data.xlsx")
```

This function creates a new workbook using the `openpyxl.Workbook()` method, selects the active worksheet using the `wb.active` property, and writes the data to the worksheet using a `for` loop and the `ws.append()` method. Finally, the function saves the workbook using the `wb.save()` method with the filename "data.xlsx".
