This error message suggests that the preview target is not included in the current scheme. You can try the following steps to fix the issue:

1. Open the project settings by clicking on the project file in the Project Navigator and selecting "Edit Scheme" from the dropdown menu.
2. Select the "Test" action from the left sidebar.
3. Make sure that the preview target is included in the "Test" action. If it is not, click the "+" button and add it.
4. Clean the project by selecting "Product" from the menu bar and clicking "Clean Build Folder".
5. Try running the preview again.

If the issue persists, you can try resetting the Xcode preferences by running the following command in Terminal: `defaults delete com.apple.dt.Xcode`. This will reset Xcode to its default settings, so make sure to backup any custom settings before running this command.
