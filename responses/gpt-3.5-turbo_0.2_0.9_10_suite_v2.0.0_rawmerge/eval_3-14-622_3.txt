To conform to the `ShapeStyle` protocol, you need to implement the `fill` method that takes a `ContentShape` and a `style` parameter. In your case, you can simply make `RedView` conform to `ShapeStyle` by adding the `fill` method like this:

```
struct RedView: ShapeStyle {
    func makeBody(configuration: Self.Configuration) -> some View {
        Color.red
    }
}
```

Then you can use `RedView` as the fill style for your `Circle`:

```
Circle()
    .fill(RedView())
```
