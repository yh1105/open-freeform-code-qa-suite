By default, Laravel's `dd()` function has a depth limit of 3 levels. However, you can increase this limit by passing an optional second argument to the `dd()` function.

For example, if you want to increase the depth limit to 5 levels, you can use the following code:

```php
dd($data, 5);
```

This will display the `$data` variable with a depth limit of 5 levels.

Alternatively, you can use the `dump()` function instead of `dd()`. The `dump()` function does not have a depth limit and will display all levels of nested data.

```php
dump($data);
```

I hope this helps!
