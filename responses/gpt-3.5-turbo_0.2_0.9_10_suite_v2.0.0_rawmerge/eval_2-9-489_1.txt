This warning is related to Elasticsearch's built-in security features not being enabled. Without authentication, your cluster could be accessible to anyone. 

To fix this, you need to enable Elasticsearch's built-in security features. Here are the steps to follow:

1. Open the Elasticsearch configuration file. You can find it in your Rails app's `config` directory.

2. Add the following lines to the bottom of the file:

```
xpack.security.enabled: true
xpack.security.transport.ssl.enabled: true
```

3. Save the file and restart Elasticsearch.

After restarting Elasticsearch, the warning should disappear. If you still see the warning, you may need to check your Elasticsearch version and ensure that it supports the security features.
