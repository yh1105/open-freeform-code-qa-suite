In AndroidX, you can instantiate a ViewModel using the `ViewModelProvider` class. Here's an example:

```
val viewModel = ViewModelProvider(this).get(MyViewModel::class.java)
```

Make sure that you have added the necessary dependencies in your app's build.gradle file:

```
implementation "androidx.lifecycle:lifecycle-viewmodel-ktx:2.3.1"
```

Also, make sure that your ViewModel class extends the `ViewModel` class from the `androidx.lifecycle` package.
