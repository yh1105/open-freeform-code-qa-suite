To have the line drawn only to the top, you can use the `border-t` class instead of `border`. The `border-t` class applies a border only to the top of the element. Here's an example:

```html
<div class="border-t border-blue-900 border-t-1">foo</div>
```

This will apply a border of width 1 to the top of the element with a blue color.
