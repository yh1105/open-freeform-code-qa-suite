To disable the back button in Flutter when the user has reached the login page after logging out, you can use the `WillPopScope` widget. Wrap your login page with `WillPopScope` and set its `onWillPop` property to return a `Future.value(false)`. This will prevent the user from going back to the previous page using the back button or swipe gesture.

Here's an example:

```
class LoginPage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return WillPopScope(
      onWillPop: () => Future.value(false),
      child: Scaffold(
        // Your login page UI here
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

Note that this approach only prevents the user from going back to the previous page using the back button or swipe gesture. If the user navigates to the login page using a different method (e.g. deep link), they may still be able to go back to the previous page.
