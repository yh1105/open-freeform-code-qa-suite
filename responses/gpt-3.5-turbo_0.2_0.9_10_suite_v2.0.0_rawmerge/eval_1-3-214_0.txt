The error you are getting is due to a version incompatibility between pandas and pandas-profiling. The `join_axes` parameter was removed in pandas version 1.0, but some versions of pandas-profiling still use it.

To solve this issue, you can try downgrading pandas to a version that is compatible with pandas-profiling. You can do this by running the following command in your conda environment:

```
conda install pandas=0.25.3
```

Alternatively, you can try upgrading pandas-profiling to the latest version, which should be compatible with pandas 1.0. You can do this by running the following command:

```
pip install pandas-profiling[notebook]
```

Once you have resolved the version incompatibility, you can try running the `ProfileReport` function again. Here is an example of how to use it:

```python
import pandas as pd
import pandas_profiling

data = pd.read_csv('data.csv')
profile = pandas_profiling.ProfileReport(data)
profile.to_file(output_file="output.html")
```

This will generate an HTML report that you can view in your browser.
