Here's the Python code to solve the problem:

```python
def to_camel_case(text):
    if not text:
        return ""
    words = re.split(r'[-_]', text)
    return words[0] + ''.join(word.capitalize() for word in words[1:])
```

This function first checks if the input string is empty or not. If it's empty, it returns an empty string. Otherwise, it splits the string into words using the regular expression `r'[-_]'`, which matches either a dash or an underscore. Then, it capitalizes all the words except the first one and joins them together to form the camel case string.

You need to import the `re` module to use regular expressions in Python.
