It seems like there is an issue with removing the dependencies 'requests' and 'setuptools' from the conda environment. One possible solution is to create a new environment and install the required packages in that environment. You can try the following steps:

1. Create a new environment using the following command:

   ```bash
   conda create --name myenv python=3.6
   ```

   This will create a new environment named 'myenv' with Python 3.6 installed.

2. Activate the new environment using the following command:

   ```bash
   conda activate myenv
   ```

3. Install the required packages in the new environment using the following command:

   ```bash
   conda install --file python3.6-environment-windows.yml
   ```

   This will install all the packages listed in the 'python3.6-environment-windows.yml' file in the new environment.

4. Once the installation is complete, you can deactivate the environment using the following command:

   ```bash
   conda deactivate
   ```

   This will deactivate the 'myenv' environment and return you to the base environment.

5. You can now use the new environment by activating it using the command in step 2 whenever you need to use the third party library.
