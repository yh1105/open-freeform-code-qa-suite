You can disable the automatic ordering of includes in clang-format by adding the following line to your `.clang-format` file:

```
SortIncludes: false
```

This will disable the sorting of includes and preserve the order in which they appear in your code. 

If you don't have a `.clang-format` file, you can create one in the root directory of your project and add the above line to it. 

Note that disabling the sorting of includes may make your code less readable and harder to maintain. It's generally a good practice to keep your includes sorted and organized to make it easier for others to understand your code.
