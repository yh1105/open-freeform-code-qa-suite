To create an animation after hovering over the link using Tailwind CSS, you can use the `group-hover` variant and the `transform` property. Here's an example code:

```html
<a href="#" class="group text-sky-600 transition duration-300 relative">
    Link
    <span class="block max-w-0 duration-500 h-0.5 bg-sky-600 absolute bottom-0 left-0"></span>
    <span class="block max-w-0 duration-500 h-0.5 bg-sky-600 absolute bottom-0 right-0"></span>
</a>
```

In this code, we added the `relative` class to the link to make the `absolute` positioned child elements relative to the link. We also added two `span` elements with the `absolute` position and `bottom` and `left` or `right` properties to create the underline effect.

To animate the underline effect, we can use the `transform` property with the `scaleX` function. We can apply this transformation to the `:hover` and `group-hover` states of the link. Here's the updated code:

```html
<a href="#" class="group text-sky-600 transition duration-300 relative">
    Link
    <span class="block max-w-0 duration-500 h-0.5 bg-sky-600 absolute bottom-0 left-0 transform origin-left scale-0 group-hover:scale-100"></span>
    <span class="block max-w-0 duration-500 h-0.5 bg-sky-600 absolute bottom-0 right-0 transform origin-right scale-0 group-hover:scale-100"></span>
</a>
```

In this code, we added the `transform` property with the `origin-left` and `origin-right` values to set the transformation origin to the left and right edges of the underline. We also added the `scale-0` class to set the initial scale of the underline to zero. Finally, we added the `group-hover:scale-100` class to apply the `scaleX(1)` transformation when the link is hovered over.
