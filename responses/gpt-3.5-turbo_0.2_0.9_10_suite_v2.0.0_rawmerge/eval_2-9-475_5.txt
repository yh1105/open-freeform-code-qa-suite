You can try installing `libffi` using Homebrew, which is a package manager for macOS. Here are the steps:

1. Install Homebrew by running this command in your terminal:
```
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

2. Once Homebrew is installed, run this command to install `libffi`:
```
brew install libffi
```

3. After `libffi` is installed, try running `gem install travis` again and it should work.
