The error message you are seeing is related to ESLint, which is a popular tool for linting and analyzing JavaScript and TypeScript code. It seems that ESLint is unable to find your `tsconfig.json` file, which is needed to properly analyze your TypeScript code.

In your `.eslintrc.js` file, you have specified the location of your `tsconfig.json` file using the `parserOptions.project` property:

```javascript
parserOptions: {
  project: "tsconfig.json",
  sourceType: "module",
},
```

This tells ESLint to use the specified `tsconfig.json` file to understand your TypeScript code. However, it seems that ESLint is unable to find this file.

To fix this issue, you can try the following steps:

1. Make sure that your `tsconfig.json` file is located in the root directory of your project, alongside your `package.json` file.

2. Check that the path to your `tsconfig.json` file is correct. If your `tsconfig.json` file is located in a different directory, you will need to update the `parserOptions.project` property in your `.eslintrc.js` file to point to the correct location.

3. If you have recently added or moved your `tsconfig.json` file, try restarting your editor or running `npm install` to ensure that all dependencies are up to date.

4. If none of the above steps work, you can try disabling ESLint in your editor or removing the ESLint configuration entirely. However, this is not recommended as ESLint is a useful tool for catching errors and improving code quality.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
