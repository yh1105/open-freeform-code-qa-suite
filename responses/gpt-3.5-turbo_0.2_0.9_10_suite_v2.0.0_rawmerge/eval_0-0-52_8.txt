To remove a package installed using `ng add`, you can use the following command:

```
ng remove <package-name>
```

For example, if you want to remove the `@angular/material` package, you can use the following command:

```
ng remove @angular/material
```

This will remove the package and also remove any configuration changes made by the package.
