There are a few things you can try to get the preview canvas to show up in Xcode 11 beta:

1. Make sure you have the latest version of Xcode 11 beta installed.
2. Check that you are in the correct canvas mode. You can switch between code and canvas mode by clicking the editor mode button in the top-right corner of the Xcode window.
3. Try cleaning the build folder by going to Product > Clean Build Folder in the Xcode menu.
4. If none of the above solutions work, try restarting Xcode or your computer.

If the preview canvas still doesn't show up, you can try running the app on a simulator or a physical device to see the UI.
