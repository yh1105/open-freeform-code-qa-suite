It's possible that the XML response is not being properly generated by the server. You can check the response headers to see if the server is actually sending an XML response. You can do this by using the `-i` flag with `curl`:

```bash
$ curl -X GET "http://localhost:8080/pet/1" -H  "accept: application/xml" -i
```

This will show you the response headers along with the response body. Look for the `Content-Type` header to see if the server is actually sending an XML response.

If the server is sending an XML response, then it's possible that the client is not properly handling the XML response. You can try using a different client or parsing the XML response manually to see if that resolves the issue.
