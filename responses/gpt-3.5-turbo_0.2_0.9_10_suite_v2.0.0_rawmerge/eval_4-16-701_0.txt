You can use the `Split-Path` cmdlet to split the PATH environment variable into an array of directories, and then use the `-contains` operator to check if the specified directory is in the array. Here's an example function:

```
function FolderIsInPATH($Path_to_directory) {
    $path_dirs = $env:PATH -split ';'
    return $path_dirs -contains $Path_to_directory
}
```

You can call this function with the path to the directory you want to check, like this:

```
FolderIsInPATH "C:\Program Files\MyApp"
```

This will return `True` if the directory is in the PATH, and `False` otherwise.
