You can use the `iter()` method to create an iterator over the vector, and then use the `min()` method to get the minimum value. Here's an example:

```rust
let v = vec![5, 6, 8, 4, 2, 7];
let min_value = *v.iter().min().unwrap();
println!("Minimum value: {}", min_value);
```

In this example, `iter()` creates an iterator over the vector `v`, and `min()` returns the minimum value from the iterator. The `unwrap()` method is used to extract the value from the `Option` returned by `min()`. Finally, the `*` operator is used to dereference the resulting reference to the minimum value.
