You can use the `str.replace()` method of pandas to remove the special characters from the end of each row. Here's the function `remove()` that does this:

```python
def remove(df):
    df['LGA'] = df['LGA'].str.replace(r'\s*\(.*\)$', '')
    return df
```

Here, we are using a regular expression to match the special characters at the end of each row. The regular expression `\s*\(.*\)$` matches any whitespace characters followed by an opening parenthesis, followed by any characters, followed by a closing parenthesis, at the end of the string. The `str.replace()` method replaces this pattern with an empty string.

You can call this function with your DataFrame variable `df` as the argument, like this:

```python
df = remove(df)
```

This will modify the `df` DataFrame in place, removing the special characters from the "LGA" column.
