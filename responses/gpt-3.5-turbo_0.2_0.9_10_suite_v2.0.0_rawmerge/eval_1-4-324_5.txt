You can use the `tidyr` package to split the column into separate columns. Here's a possible implementation of the `mySplit` function:

```r
library(tidyr)

mySplit <- function(df) {
  # separate the column into three columns based on the comma and colon separators
  df_split <- separate(df, col1, into = c("name", "Age", "City"), sep = "[:,]")
  
  # remove the "name:", "Age:", and "City:" prefixes from the columns
  df_split$name <- gsub("name:", "", df_split$name)
  df_split$Age <- gsub("Age:", "", df_split$Age)
  df_split$City <- gsub("City:", "", df_split$City)
  
  # return the resulting data frame
  return(df_split)
}
```

You can call this function with your example data frame `df` as follows:

```r
df <- data.frame(col1 = c("name:Michael,Age:31,City:NYC", "name:Tom,Age:25,City:NA"))
mySplit(df)
```

This should return the desired output:

```
     name Age City
1 Michael  31  NYC
2     Tom  25   NA
```
