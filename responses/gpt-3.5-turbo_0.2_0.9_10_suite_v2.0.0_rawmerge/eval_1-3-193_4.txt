The error message suggests that the Firefox binary location is not set properly. You can try specifying the path to the Firefox binary location using the `executable_path` argument when creating the `webdriver.Firefox()` instance. 

Here's an example:

```python
from selenium import webdriver

firefox_binary_path = '/path/to/firefox/binary' # replace with the actual path to the Firefox binary

firefox_options = webdriver.FirefoxOptions()
firefox_options.binary_location = firefox_binary_path

browser = webdriver.Firefox(firefox_options=firefox_options, executable_path='/path/to/geckodriver')
browser.get('http://www.seleniumhq.org')
```

Make sure to replace `/path/to/firefox/binary` with the actual path to the Firefox binary on your system. Also, make sure to download and install the `geckodriver` executable and specify its path using the `executable_path` argument.
