Yes, you can achieve the same result as the FILTER function in Office 365 by using the combination of INDEX and MATCH functions in Excel. Here's an example formula:
`=INDEX(B:B, MATCH("x", A:A, 0))`
This formula will return the first value in `Column B` where `Column A` has a value of `x`. If you want to get all the values in `Column B` where `Column A` has a value of `x`, you can use the following formula:
`=IFERROR(INDEX(B:B, SMALL(IF(A:A="x", ROW(A:A)-ROW(INDEX(A:A,1,1))+1), ROWS(A$1:A1))), "")`
This is an array formula, so you need to enter it with `Ctrl+Shift+Enter`. You can drag this formula down to get all the matching values in `Column B`.
