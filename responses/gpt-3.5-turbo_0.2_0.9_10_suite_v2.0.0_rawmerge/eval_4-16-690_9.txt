Starting with macOS Catalina 10.15, the default shell is now `zsh` instead of `bash`. This means that if you have previously set up your environment variables in `~/.bash_profile`, they will not be automatically sourced by your shell anymore.

To set up your environment variables in `zsh`, you can create or edit the `~/.zshrc` file and add the following line:

```
export JBOSS_HOME=/Users/{USERNAME}/Desktop/jboss7
```

Save the file and then execute the following command to apply the changes:

```
source ~/.zshrc
```

Now, when you execute `echo $JBOSS_HOME`, you should see the correct value.

Alternatively, you can switch back to using `bash` as your default shell by running the following command:

```
chsh -s /bin/bash
```

Afterward, you can set up your environment variables in `~/.bash_profile` as you normally would.
