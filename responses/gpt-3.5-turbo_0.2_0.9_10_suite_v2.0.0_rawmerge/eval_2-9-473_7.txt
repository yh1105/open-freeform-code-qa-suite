The error message suggests that there is an issue with the encryption of a message. To fix this error, you can try to regenerate your credentials by following these steps:

1. Remove the `master.key` file:
```
rm -rf config/master.key
```
2. Create a new `master.key` file:
```
EDITOR="mate --wait" bin/rails credentials:edit
```
This will open up your credentials file in your text editor. Save and close the file to generate a new `master.key` file.

3. Add the new `master.key` file to your git repository and commit the changes:
```
git add config/master.key
git commit -m "Regenerate credentials"
```

4. Push the changes to Heroku:
```
git push heroku master
```

This should fix the encryption error and allow you to deploy your app to Heroku successfully.
