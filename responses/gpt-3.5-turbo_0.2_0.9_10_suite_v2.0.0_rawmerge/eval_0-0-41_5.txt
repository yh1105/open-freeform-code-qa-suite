The code you provided looks correct. However, if the location is not available, the `getCurrentPosition()` function will not be called, and therefore the `console.log("Location accessed")` statement will not be executed. Instead, you can add an error callback function to handle the case where the location is not available. Here's the revised code:

```javascript
if (navigator.geolocation) {
    navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(
        position => {
            console.log("Location accessed");
        },
        error => {
            console.log("User not allowed");
        }
    );
} else {
    console.log("Geolocation is not supported by this browser.");
}
```

In this revised code, if the location is not available, the error callback function will be called and the message "User not allowed" will be logged to the console.
