TailwindCSS is a utility-first CSS framework, which means it provides pre-defined classes that you can use to style your HTML elements. In order to access the direct children of a div with class "section" using TailwindCSS, you can use the `>` selector in combination with the `class` attribute.

Here's an example:

```html
<div class="section">
  <div class="child">Child 1</div>
  <div class="child">Child 2</div>
</div>
```

To style the direct children of the `div` with class `section`, you can use the following TailwindCSS classes:

```html
<div class="section">
  <div class="child bg-blue-500">Child 1</div>
  <div class="child bg-red-500">Child 2</div>
</div>
```

In this example, the `bg-blue-500` and `bg-red-500` classes are used to set the background color of the direct children of the `div` with class `section`. The `>` selector is not needed in this case, as TailwindCSS provides classes for styling direct children by default.
