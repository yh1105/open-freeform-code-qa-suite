The issue is that you are missing a comma after the value of the primary color in your `$theme-colors` map. Here's the corrected code:

```scss
@import "../../node_modules/bootstrap/scss/variables";

$theme-colors: (
  "primary": #0d6efd, // add comma here
);

@import "../../node_modules/bootstrap/scss/bootstrap";
```

Note that you should replace `#0d6efd` with your desired primary color value. After making this change, you should be able to compile your SCSS file without any errors.
