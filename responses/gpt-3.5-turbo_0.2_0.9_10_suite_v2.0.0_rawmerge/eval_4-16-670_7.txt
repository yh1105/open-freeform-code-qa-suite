Yes, you can convert your OpenSSH private key to an RSA private key using the `ssh-keygen` command. Here are the steps:

1. Open Terminal on your Mac.
2. Type the following command to convert the key:

   ```
   ssh-keygen -p -m PEM -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa
   ```

   This command will prompt you to enter the passphrase for your key. Enter the passphrase and press Enter.

3. You will then see a prompt asking you to enter the new passphrase. Press Enter to keep the same passphrase.

4. The command will then convert your key to the RSA format and save it to `~/.ssh/id_rsa`.

5. If you want to use the converted key to access the server, you will need to send the new `id_rsa` file to the server administrator. You do not need to send the `id_rsa.pub` file, as it is just the public key and does not contain any sensitive information.

Note: If you have multiple keys in your `~/.ssh` directory, you will need to specify the filename of the key you want to convert in the command. For example, if your key is named `my_key`, the command would be:

```
ssh-keygen -p -m PEM -f ~/.ssh/my_key
```
