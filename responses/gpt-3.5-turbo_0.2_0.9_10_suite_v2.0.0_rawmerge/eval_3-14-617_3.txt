This error usually occurs when there is an issue with the build settings or the project file. Here are some steps you can try to resolve the issue:

1. Clean the project: Go to Product > Clean Build Folder in Xcode and then try to build the project again.

2. Check the build settings: Make sure that the build settings are correct for the project. Check the "Build Phases" section in the project settings and make sure that all the required frameworks and libraries are added.

3. Check the script: Check the script that is failing and make sure that it is correct. You can also try to remove the script and then add it again.

4. Update the pods: Try updating the pods to the latest version by running `pod update` in the terminal.

5. Check for any missing files: Check if any files are missing from the project or if there are any broken references. You can try removing and re-adding the files to the project.

6. Try a different Xcode version: If none of the above steps work, try using a different version of Xcode and see if the issue persists.

Hopefully, one of these steps will help you resolve the issue.
