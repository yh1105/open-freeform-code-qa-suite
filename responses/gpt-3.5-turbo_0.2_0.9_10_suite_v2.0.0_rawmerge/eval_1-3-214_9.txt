The error message suggests that the `join_axes` argument is not recognized by the `concat()` function. This is likely due to a version mismatch between Pandas and pandas-profiling.

To solve this problem, you can try the following steps:

1. Upgrade pandas-profiling to the latest version using the following command:

   ```
   !pip install pandas-profiling[notebook]
   ```

2. Upgrade pandas to the latest version using the following command:

   ```
   !pip install pandas --upgrade
   ```

3. Restart the Jupyter notebook kernel and try running the Profile Report code again.

If the issue persists, you can try downgrading pandas to version 0.25.3 using the following command:

```
!pip install pandas==0.25.3
```

Then, restart the Jupyter notebook kernel and try running the Profile Report code again.

Alternatively, you can try using the `pandas_profiling.ProfileReport()` function with the `minimal=True` argument, which generates a report without using the `join_axes` argument:

```python
profile = pandas_profiling.ProfileReport(data, minimal=True)
```

I hope this helps!
