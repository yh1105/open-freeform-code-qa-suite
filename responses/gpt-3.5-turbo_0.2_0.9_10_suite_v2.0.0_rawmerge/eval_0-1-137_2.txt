The issue is that you are missing a comma after the value of the primary color in the `$theme-colors` map. Here's the corrected code:

```scss
@import "../../node_modules/bootstrap/scss/variables";

$theme-colors: (
  "primary": #0d6efd, // add a comma here
);

@import "../../node_modules/bootstrap/scss/bootstrap";
```

Make sure to add a comma after each key-value pair in the `$theme-colors` map. This should fix the invalid CSS value error.
