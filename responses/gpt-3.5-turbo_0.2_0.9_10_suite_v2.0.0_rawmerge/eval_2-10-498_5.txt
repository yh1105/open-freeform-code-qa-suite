In Rust, the caret operator (`^`) is not used for exponentiation, but for bitwise XOR operation. To perform exponentiation, you can use the `pow` method that is available on all numeric types. Here's an example:

```rust
let x = 2i32;
let y = x.pow(3);
println!("{}", y); // prints 8
```

In this example, we raise the integer `x` to the power of 3 using the `pow` method, which returns the result as a new integer. The `pow` method takes a single argument, which is the exponent to raise the number to.

If you need to raise a floating-point number to a power, you can use the `powf` method instead:

```rust
let x = 2.0f64;
let y = x.powf(3.0);
println!("{}", y); // prints 8.0
```

In this example, we raise the floating-point number `x` to the power of 3 using the `powf` method, which returns the result as a new floating-point number. The `powf` method takes a single argument, which is the exponent to raise the number to.
