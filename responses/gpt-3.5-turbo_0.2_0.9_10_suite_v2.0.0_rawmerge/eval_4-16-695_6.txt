You can try using the `-q` or `--quiet` flag with the `docker build` command. This will suppress the build output and only show the final image ID. Then, you can use the `docker history` command to see the full build output.

For example:
```
docker build -q -t myimage .
docker history myimage
```

This will show you the full build output, including the results of the `ls -la` commands.
