You can disable the automatic ordering of includes in clang-format by adding the following line to your `.clang-format` file:

```
SortIncludes: false
```

This will disable the sorting of includes and preserve the order you have specified in your code. If you don't have a `.clang-format` file yet, you can create one in the root directory of your project and add the above line to it.

Note that disabling the sorting of includes may cause some warnings or errors to appear in your code, especially if you are using third-party libraries that require a specific include order. It's important to make sure that your code still compiles and runs correctly after disabling the sorting of includes.
