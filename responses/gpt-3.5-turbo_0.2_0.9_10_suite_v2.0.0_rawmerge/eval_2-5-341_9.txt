It's possible that the XML response is not being properly generated by the server. You can check if the server is properly configured to generate XML responses by adding the `produces` attribute to the `@GetMapping` annotation in your controller method:

```java
@GetMapping(value = "/pet/{petId}", produces = { "application/xml", "application/json" })
public ResponseEntity<Pet> getPetById(@PathVariable Long petId) {
    // ...
}
```

This will ensure that the server generates both XML and JSON responses for the request. If the XML response is still not working, you can check if the `jackson-dataformat-xml` dependency is properly included in your project. This dependency is required to generate XML responses in Spring Boot applications. You can add it to your `build.gradle` file:

```groovy
dependencies {
    // ...
    implementation 'com.fasterxml.jackson.dataformat:jackson-dataformat-xml'
    // ...
}
```

After adding the dependency, you may need to refresh your project in your IDE or run `./gradlew clean build` to download the new dependency.
