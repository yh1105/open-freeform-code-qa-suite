The error message "419 Page Expired" is related to Laravel's CSRF protection. When you log in, Laravel generates a CSRF token and stores it in the session. When you submit a form, Laravel checks if the token in the form matches the token in the session. If they don't match, Laravel assumes that the form submission is a CSRF attack and throws the "419 Page Expired" error.

In your case, when you log out from one tab, the CSRF token in the session is invalidated. When you try to log out from the other tab, the CSRF token in the form is still the old one, which doesn't match the token in the session. That's why you get the "419 Page Expired" error.

To avoid this error, you can add a check in your logout code to see if the CSRF token is still valid. If it's not valid, you can regenerate a new token and redirect the user to the logout page again. Here's an example code:

```
public function logout(Request $request)
{
    if (! $request->session()->regenerateToken()) {
        return redirect()->back();
    }

    Auth::logout();

    return redirect('/');
}
```

This code regenerates the CSRF token and checks if it's successful. If it's successful, it logs out the user and redirects them to the home page. If it's not successful, it redirects the user back to the previous page.
