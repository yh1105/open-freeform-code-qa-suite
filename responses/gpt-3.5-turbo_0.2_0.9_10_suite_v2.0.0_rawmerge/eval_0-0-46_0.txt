It seems like ESLint is trying to read the `tsconfig.json` file but it is unable to find it. You can try the following steps to resolve the issue:

1. Make sure that the `tsconfig.json` file is located in the root directory of your project.

2. Check if you have installed the required dependencies for ESLint and TypeScript. You can run the following command in your terminal to install them:

   ```
   npm install --save-dev eslint @typescript-eslint/parser @typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin
   ```

3. Update the `parserOptions` in your `.eslintrc.js` file to include the `tsconfig.json` file path relative to the `.eslintrc.js` file:

   ```javascript
   parserOptions: {
     project: "./tsconfig.json",
     sourceType: "module",
   },
   ```

4. Restart your VSCode editor and check if the error is resolved.

If the above steps do not work, you can try deleting the `.vscode` folder in your project directory and restarting VSCode. This will reset all the VSCode settings for your project and may resolve the issue.
