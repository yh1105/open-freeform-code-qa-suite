The error occurs because some values in the "year" column are in float format with a decimal point. To convert the column to int, we need to remove the decimal point first. Here is the modified code:

```python
data_h_df['year'] = data_h_df['year'].astype(str).str.split('.').str[0].astype(int)
```

This code converts the "year" column to string, splits the string at the decimal point, takes the first part (before the decimal point), and then converts it to int.

Here is the `transformation` function:

```python
def transformation(data_h_df):
    data_h_df['year'] = data_h_df['year'].astype(str).str.split('.').str[0].astype(int)
    return data_h_df
```

You can call this function with your dataframe as argument to get the transformed dataframe.
