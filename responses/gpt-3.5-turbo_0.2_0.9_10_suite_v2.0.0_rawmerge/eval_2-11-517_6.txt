In C++, you can use the `std::string` class and the `+` operator to concatenate strings and variables. Here's an example:

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

int main() {
    int myVariable = 42;
    std::string myString = "My variable has value " + std::to_string(myVariable);
    std::cout << myString << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

Output:
```
My variable has value 42
```

Alternatively, you can use the `stringstream` class to build a string with variables. Here's an example:

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <sstream>

int main() {
    int myVariable = 42;
    std::stringstream myStream;
    myStream << "My variable has value " << myVariable;
    std::string myString = myStream.str();
    std::cout << myString << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

Output:
```
My variable has value 42
```
