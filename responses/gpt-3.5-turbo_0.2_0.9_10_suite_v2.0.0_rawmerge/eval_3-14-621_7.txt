The error message is telling you that you cannot access a `@State` variable outside of the `body` property of a `View`. In your case, you are trying to access `fullText` in the `init` method, which is not allowed.

One solution to this problem is to use a computed property instead of the `init` method to set the initial value of `fullText`. Here's an example:

```
struct StateFromOutside: View {
    let list = [
        "a": "Letter A",
        "b": "Letter B",
        // ...
    ]
    @State var fullText: String

    var letter: String

    var body: some View {
        TextField($fullText)
    }

    init(letter: String) {
        self.letter = letter
        self._fullText = State(initialValue: list[letter]!)
    }
}
```

In this example, we create a computed property `fullText` that uses the `list` dictionary to set its initial value based on the `letter` parameter passed to the `init` method. We also store the `letter` parameter in a separate property so that we can use it in the computed property.

Note that we use the `_fullText` property wrapper to access the underlying `State` variable, since we cannot access the `fullText` property directly in the `init` method.
