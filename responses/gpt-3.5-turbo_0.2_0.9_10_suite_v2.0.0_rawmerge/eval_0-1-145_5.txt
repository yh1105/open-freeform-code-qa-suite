To use the `truncate` class in TailwindCSS, you need to make sure that the parent element has a defined width. 

Try adding a width to the parent element like this:

```html
<div class="ml-1 inline-block w-64">
   <span>Label: </span>
   <span class="font-semibold truncate">
     long texttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttt
   </span>
</div>
```

In this example, the parent element has a width of 64 pixels (`w-64`), but you can adjust this to fit your needs. 

Also, make sure that you are using `class` instead of `className` in your HTML code.
