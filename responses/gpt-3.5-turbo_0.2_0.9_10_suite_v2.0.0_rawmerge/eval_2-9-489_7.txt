The warning message is indicating that Elasticsearch built-in security features are not enabled and your cluster could be accessible to anyone without authentication. To fix this, you need to enable security in Elasticsearch.

Here are the steps to enable security in Elasticsearch:

1. Open the Elasticsearch configuration file `elasticsearch.yml` located in the `config` directory of your Elasticsearch installation.

2. Uncomment the following lines in the `elasticsearch.yml` file:

```
xpack.security.enabled: true
```

3. Save the `elasticsearch.yml` file.

4. Restart Elasticsearch.

After restarting Elasticsearch, the warning message should disappear. If you still see the warning message, make sure that you have the latest version of Elasticsearch installed and that you have followed the steps correctly.

Note: If you are using Elasticsearch in a production environment, it is highly recommended to enable security to protect your cluster from unauthorized access.
