You can create a calendar input in VBA Excel without using any external ocx files by creating a userform with a calendar control. You can add a calendar control to the userform by going to the toolbox and selecting "Microsoft Date and Time Picker Control". Once you have added the control to the userform, you can customize it to fit your needs. You can then link the calendar control to a cell in your worksheet to store the selected date.
