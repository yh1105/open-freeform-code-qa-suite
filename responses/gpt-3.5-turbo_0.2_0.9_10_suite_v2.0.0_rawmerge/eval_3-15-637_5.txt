The issue you are facing could be due to the incompatibility of the Selenium WebDriver version with the Excel 2019 version. Here are a few things you can try to resolve the issue:

1. Make sure that you have the latest version of Selenium WebDriver installed. You can download it from the official Selenium website.

2. Check if the reference to the Selenium type library is correct. To do this, go to the VBA editor, click on Tools > References, and make sure that the reference to the Selenium type library is checked.

3. Try using a different browser driver. For example, if you are currently using the Internet Explorer driver, try using the Chrome or Firefox driver instead.

4. Try running the code in compatibility mode. To do this, right-click on the Excel shortcut and select Properties. Then, go to the Compatibility tab and select the option to run the program in compatibility mode for an earlier version of Windows.

5. Try running the code on a different machine with Excel 2019 installed to see if the issue is specific to your machine.

I hope one of these solutions helps you resolve the issue.
