@Configuration should be used when you need to define beans that require additional configuration beyond what is available with the other annotations. It allows you to define beans and their dependencies using Java code instead of XML configuration. Additionally, @Configuration can be used to define beans that are not specific to a particular layer of the application (such as @Service or @Controller), but rather are used throughout the application.
