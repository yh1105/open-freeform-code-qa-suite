It seems that there might be a dependency conflict between the version of Hibernate Validator that is included in your project and the one that is being used by JBoss. 

You can try excluding the Hibernate Validator dependency from your project and let JBoss use its own version. To do this, add the following exclusion to your pom.xml:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-validation</artifactId>
    <exclusions>
        <exclusion>
            <groupId>org.hibernate.validator</groupId>
            <artifactId>hibernate-validator</artifactId>
        </exclusion>
    </exclusions>
</dependency>
```

Then, add the following dependency to your pom.xml to include the correct version of Hibernate Validator:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.hibernate.validator</groupId>
    <artifactId>hibernate-validator</artifactId>
    <version>5.3.5.Final-redhat-2</version>
</dependency>
```

Alternatively, you can try upgrading the version of Hibernate Validator in your project to match the one used by JBoss.
