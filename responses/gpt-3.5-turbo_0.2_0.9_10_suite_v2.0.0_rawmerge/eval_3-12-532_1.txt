The `FormatException` is thrown when the JSON string is not properly formatted. In your case, the error message suggests that the first character of the JSON string is unexpected.

To solve this issue, you can try the following steps:

1. Check the response body to ensure that it is a valid JSON string. You can print the response body to the console and check if it is a valid JSON string.

2. If the response body is not a valid JSON string, you can check the PHP file to ensure that it is returning a valid JSON string. You can use a tool like Postman to test the PHP file and ensure that it is returning a valid JSON string.

3. If the PHP file is returning a valid JSON string, you can check the encoding of the response body. The `http.post` method returns a `Response` object, which has a `headers` property that contains the content type of the response. You can check the content type to ensure that it is `application/json`.

4. If the content type is correct, you can check the encoding of the response body. The `http.post` method has an `encoding` parameter that specifies the encoding of the request body. You can ensure that the encoding of the response body matches the encoding specified in the `encoding` parameter.

5. If none of the above steps solve the issue, you can try using a different JSON decoding library like `dart:convert` or `json_serializable`.
