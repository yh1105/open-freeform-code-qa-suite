To use the `truncate` class in TailwindCSS, you need to make sure that the element has a fixed width or is inside an element with a fixed width. 

You can try adding a `max-w-xs` class to the parent `div` element to limit its width and allow the `truncate` class to work properly. 

Here's an updated code snippet:

```html
<div className="ml-1 inline-block max-w-xs">
   <span>Label: </span>
   <span className="font-semibold truncate">
     long texttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttt
   </span>
</div>
```

This should make the text truncate with an ellipsis if it overflows beyond one line.
