To move the "Stop Game" button to the top and align it with the "Begin Game" button, you can add the following CSS code to your `style.css` file:

```css
#GameStopped {
  position: relative;
}

#StopBtn {
  position: absolute;
  top: 0;
  left: 0;
}
```

This will make the `#GameStopped` div a relative positioned container and the `#StopBtn` button an absolutely positioned element inside it. The `top: 0` and `left: 0` properties will align the button to the top left corner of the container. You may need to adjust the `left` property to center the button horizontally.
