One way to express this more idiomatically is to use the `Option::filter` method, which returns `None` if the inner value does not meet the condition, or `Some` with the original value otherwise. Here's an example:

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut foo: Option<u8> = None;
    if foo.filter(|&val| val < 5).is_none() {
        foo.replace(5);
    }
}
```

Another way is to use the `Option::map_or_else` method, which takes two closures: one to handle the `Some` case, and one to handle the `None` case. Here's an example:

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut foo: Option<u8> = None;
    foo = foo.map_or_else(|| Some(5), |val| if val < 5 { None } else { Some(val) });
}
```

This code replaces `foo` with `Some(5)` if it was `None`, or with `None` if the inner value is less than 5, or with the original value otherwise.

Finally, you can use the `Option::unwrap_or_else` method to provide a default value and a closure to handle the `Some` case. Here's an example:

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut foo: Option<u8> = None;
    foo = Some(foo.unwrap_or_else(|| 5)).filter(|&val| val >= 5);
}
```

This code replaces `foo` with `5` if it was `None`, or with the original value if it is greater than or equal to 5, or with `None` otherwise.
