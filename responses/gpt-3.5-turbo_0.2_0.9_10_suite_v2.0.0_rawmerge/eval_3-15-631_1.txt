To remove the spaces from the output, you can modify the code by adding an additional line to remove the spaces from the string after removing the special characters. Here is the modified code:

```
Sub ReplaceSpecial()
    Dim cel As Range
    Dim strVal As String
    Dim i As Long
    Application.ScreenUpdating = False
    For Each cel In Selection
        strVal = cel.Value
        For i = 1 To Len(strVal)
            Select Case Asc(Mid(strVal, i, 1))
                Case 32, 48 To 57, 65 To 90, 97 To 122
                    ' Leave ordinary characters alone
                Case Else
                    Mid(strVal, i, 1) = " "
            End Select
        Next i
        ' Remove spaces from the string
        strVal = Replace(strVal, " ", "")
        cel.Value = strVal
    Next cel
    Application.ScreenUpdating = True
End Sub
```

This code uses the `Replace` function to remove all spaces from the string after removing the special characters. Now the output will be in the format you require.
