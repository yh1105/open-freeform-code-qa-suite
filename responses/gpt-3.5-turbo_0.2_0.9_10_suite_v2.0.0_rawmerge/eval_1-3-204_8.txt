The issue with your code is that the `rename()` method is used to rename the index or column labels of a DataFrame, not to rename a specific column. To rename a specific column, you can simply assign a new name to the column using the `rename()` method of the DataFrame.

Here's the modified code that should work for you:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

def renameDataFrame(df):
    datain = np.loadtxt(datafile)
    df = pd.DataFrame(data = datain, columns = ["t","p","x","y","z"])
    avg = df.groupby(["t"], sort=False)["p"].mean().reset_index(name='mean')
    return avg
```

In this code, we first group the DataFrame by the "t" column and calculate the mean of the "p" column for each group using the `mean()` method. We then reset the index of the resulting DataFrame and rename the "p" column to "mean" using the `reset_index()` and `rename()` methods respectively.

You can call this function by passing your DataFrame as an argument and it will return the modified DataFrame with the "p" column renamed as "mean" and the average numbers grouped by the "t" column.
