To make sure the second query runs only after the first one is fulfilled, you can use the `useEffect` hook and add `user.id` as a dependency. Here's the updated code for the second query:

```javascript
const { data: userBio, isFulfilled: userBioFulfilled } = useGetUserBioQuery(user.id);

useEffect(() => {
  if (userFulfilled) {
    // Run the second query only if the first one is fulfilled
    userBioFulfilled || refetch();
  }
}, [user.id, userFulfilled, userBioFulfilled, refetch]);
```

This code uses the `refetch` function returned by the `useGetUserBioQuery` hook to manually trigger the second query if it hasn't been fulfilled yet. The `useEffect` hook will run whenever `user.id` or the fulfillment status of either query changes.
