The error message indicates that the headers or library files for zlib are missing, which is a required dependency for Pillow. To fix this issue, you can try the following steps:

1. Install zlib development files:
   - On Windows, you can download the pre-built zlib library from the Gohlke website: https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#zlib
   - On Linux, you can install the zlib development package using your package manager. For example, on Ubuntu, you can run `sudo apt-get install zlib1g-dev`.

2. Reinstall Pillow:
   - Open a terminal or command prompt and activate your virtual environment.
   - Run `pip uninstall pillow` to remove the existing Pillow installation.
   - Run `pip install pillow` to reinstall Pillow.

If the above steps do not work, you can also try installing Pillow from a wheel file instead of building from source. You can download the appropriate wheel file for your system from the PyPI website: https://pypi.org/project/Pillow/#files. Then, install the wheel file using `pip install <path-to-wheel-file>`.

Note: If you are using PyCharm, make sure to install Pillow in the correct virtual environment associated with your project. You can check the virtual environment settings in PyCharm by going to File > Settings > Project: <project-name> > Python Interpreter.
