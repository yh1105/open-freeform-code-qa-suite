To disable the back button in Flutter when the user has reached the login page after logging out, you can use the `WillPopScope` widget. Wrap your login page with `WillPopScope` and set its `onWillPop` property to return a `Future.value(false)`. This will prevent the user from going back to the previous page using the back button or swipe gesture.

Here's an example:

```
WillPopScope(
  onWillPop: () => Future.value(false),
  child: LoginPage(),
)
```

Note that this will only prevent the user from going back to the previous page using the back button or swipe gesture. If the user manually enters the previous page's URL or uses a bookmark, they will still be able to access it.
