Using `@Autowired` on the constructor is a recommended approach for dependency injection in Spring. It ensures that the required dependencies are injected at the time of object creation and makes the class immutable. It also helps in avoiding null pointer exceptions that may occur if the dependencies are not injected properly. However, if you are using Spring 4.3 or later, you can omit the `@Autowired` annotation on the constructor as Spring will automatically detect the constructor and inject the dependencies.
