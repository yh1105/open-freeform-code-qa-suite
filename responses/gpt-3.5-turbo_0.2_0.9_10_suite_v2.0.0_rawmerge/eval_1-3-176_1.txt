The error message suggests that the headers or library files for zlib are missing, which is a required dependency for Pillow. You can try installing zlib first and then installing Pillow again. Here are the steps:

1. Download the zlib library from the official website: https://www.zlib.net/
2. Extract the downloaded file to a folder on your computer.
3. Open a command prompt and navigate to the folder where you extracted the zlib library.
4. Run the following commands to build and install zlib:

   ```
   ./configure
   make
   make install
   ```

5. Once zlib is installed, try installing Pillow again using pip:

   ```
   pip install pillow
   ```

This should resolve the issue and allow you to install Pillow successfully.
