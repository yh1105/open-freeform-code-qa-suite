You can try using the `--no-cache` flag with the `docker build` command to force a rebuild of all layers, including the ones that were previously cached. This should show you the full output of each step, including steps 7 and 15 that you mentioned.

For example, you can run the following command to rebuild your Docker image with the `--no-cache` flag:

```
docker build --no-cache -t myimage .
```

This should give you the full output of each step during the build process.
