The Rule of 5 is not outdated, and it is still relevant today. While it is true that implicit constructors and destructors work fine for aggregate data structures, there are many cases where you need to manage resources explicitly. For example, if you are working with dynamic memory allocation, file handles, network connections, or any other resource that needs to be acquired and released in a specific way, you will need to define your own constructors and destructors.

Smart pointers can certainly help simplify resource management, but they are not always a suitable replacement for user-defined constructors and destructors. Smart pointers can only manage resources that can be allocated on the heap, and they may not be appropriate for all types of resources. Additionally, smart pointers can introduce overhead and may not be as efficient as managing resources directly.

In summary, while smart pointers can be a useful tool for managing resources, they are not always a suitable replacement for user-defined constructors and destructors. The Rule of 5 is still relevant today, and it is important to understand when and how to use user-defined constructors and destructors to manage resources effectively.
