In your script, you are using single quotes around the `$searchT` variable in the `grep` command. Single quotes prevent variable expansion, so the `grep` command is looking for the literal string `$searchT` instead of the value of the variable. To fix this, you can use double quotes instead of single quotes around the `grep` command. 

Here's the corrected script:

```
#!/bin/bash
read -p "enter search term here: " searchT

if [[ $(cat test.txt | grep -wi "$searchT") ]]; then     
    echo "$(cat test.txt | grep "$searchT" | wc -l) number of matches found"
    echo $(cat test.txt | grep "$searchT")

else 
    echo "no match found"    
fi

exit 0
```

In the corrected script, the `grep` command will now use the value of the `$searchT` variable. Also, I added a pipe to the `wc -l` command to count the number of matches found by `grep`.
