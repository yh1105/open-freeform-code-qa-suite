Yes, there is a better way to write this code. You can use the `?` operator to simplify the code and make it more readable. Here's an example of how you can use the `?` operator to refactor the code:

```rust
if let Some(i) = func1() {
    let j = func2(i)?;
    let k = func3(j)?;
    let result = func4(k)?;
    // Do something with result
} else {
    println!("func 1 returned None");
}
```

This code is much easier to read and understand. The `?` operator is used to propagate errors up the call stack, so you don't need to nest multiple `if let` statements. Instead, you can chain the function calls together and handle any errors that occur with a single `?` operator.
