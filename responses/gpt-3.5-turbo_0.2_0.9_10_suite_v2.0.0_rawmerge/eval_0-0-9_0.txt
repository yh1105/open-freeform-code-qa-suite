Sure! The error message is telling you that you need to provide a callback function to the `req.logout()` method. Here's how you can revise the `app.get("/logout", ...)` part of your code to fix the problem:

```javascript
app.get("/logout", function(req, res) {
    req.logout(function(err) {
        if (err) {
            console.log(err);
        }
        res.redirect("/");
    });
});
```

By providing a callback function to `req.logout()`, you're handling any errors that might occur during the logout process. If there are no errors, you're redirecting the user to the home page (`"/"`).
