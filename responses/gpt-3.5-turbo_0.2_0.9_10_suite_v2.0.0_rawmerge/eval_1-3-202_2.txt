This error occurs when conda is trying to remove a package that is a dependency of conda itself. In this case, it is trying to remove `requests` and `setuptools`. 

One solution is to create a new environment and install the required packages in that environment. You can do this by running the following commands:

```bash
conda create --name myenv
conda activate myenv
conda install package1 package2 ...
```

Replace `myenv` with the name you want to give to your new environment and `package1`, `package2`, etc. with the packages you want to install.

Another solution is to update conda and try again. You can update conda by running the following command:

```bash
conda update conda
```

After updating, try running the original command again:

```bash
conda env create -f python3.6-environment-windows.yml
```

If the error persists, try creating a new environment as described above.
