The error message indicates that the integrity check of the package failed. This can happen due to various reasons such as network issues, corrupted cache, or even a malicious attack. Here are some possible measures to resolve the issue:

1. Clear the npm cache by running `npm cache clean --force` and then try running `npm install` again.

2. Upgrade npm to the latest version by running `npm install -g npm@latest` and then try running `npm install` again.

3. Disable strict SSL by running `npm config set strict-ssl false` and then try running `npm install` again.

4. Delete the `node_modules` folder and `package-lock.json` file and then try running `npm install` again.

5. If you are using a private registry, make sure that the registry is accessible and try running `npm install` again.

6. If none of the above measures work, try deleting the `node_modules` folder, `package-lock.json` file, and `npm` folder from your home directory and then try running `npm install` again.

If the issue persists, you may want to check the npm documentation or seek help from the npm community.
