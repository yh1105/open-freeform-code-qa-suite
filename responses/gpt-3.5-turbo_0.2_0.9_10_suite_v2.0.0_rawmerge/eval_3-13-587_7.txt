This error occurs because Jacoco 0.8.6 is not compatible with Java 9 or higher, which is used by Gradle 7.0.2. To fix this issue, you can either downgrade Gradle to a version that uses Java 8 or lower, or upgrade Jacoco to a version that is compatible with Java 9 or higher.

To upgrade Jacoco, you can use version 0.8.7 or higher, which is compatible with Java 9 or higher. You can update your build.gradle file with the following code:

```
kotlin_version = "1.5.10"
...
jacoco {
    toolVersion = "0.8.7"
}
...
distributionUrl=https\://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-7.0.2-all.zip
```

After updating the Jacoco version, run the test coverage report task again and it should work without any issues.
