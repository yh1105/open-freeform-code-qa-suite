It seems like the Gradle build is not picking up the Java version that you have set in your project. You can try adding the following lines to your `build.gradle` file to explicitly set the Java version for Gradle:

```
compileJava {
    options.release = 17
}
```

This should tell Gradle to use Java 17 for compiling your code. If this doesn't work, you can also try setting the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable to point to your Java 17 installation directory. 

If you're using IntelliJ IDEA to run your app, you can also check the Run Configuration settings to make sure that the correct Java version is being used. To do this, go to Run -> Edit Configurations, select your run configuration, and check the "JRE" field to make sure it's set to the correct Java version.
