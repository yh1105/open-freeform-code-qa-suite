You can disable the automatic ordering of includes in clang-format by adding the following line to your `.clang-format` file:

```
SortIncludes: false
```

This will disable the sorting of includes and preserve the order in which they appear in your code. 

Note that disabling the sorting of includes may cause issues with some third-party libraries that require a specific order. In such cases, it is recommended to follow the library's guidelines for include order.
