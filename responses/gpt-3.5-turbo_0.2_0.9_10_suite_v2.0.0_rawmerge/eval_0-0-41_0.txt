The code you provided looks correct. However, it's possible that the user has denied permission to access their location, in which case the `getCurrentPosition()` method will fail silently. To handle this case, you can add an error callback function to the `getCurrentPosition()` method. Here's the revised code:

```javascript
if (navigator.geolocation) {
    navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(
        position => {
            console.log("Location accessed");
        },
        error => {
            console.log("User not allowed");
        }
    );
} else {
    console.log("Geolocation is not supported by this browser.");
}
```

With this code, if the user allows access to their location, the `console.log("Location accessed")` statement will be executed. If the user denies access, the `console.log("User not allowed")` statement will be executed. If geolocation is not supported by the browser, the `console.log("Geolocation is not supported by this browser.")` statement will be executed.
