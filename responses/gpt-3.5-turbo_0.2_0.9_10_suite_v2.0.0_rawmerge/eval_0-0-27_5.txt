It seems like the issue is with the `uri` provided in the `ApolloClient` configuration. The `uri` you are using is for a demo server provided by Apollo, which may not be working properly at the moment.

You should replace the `uri` with the endpoint of your GraphQL server. For example:

```javascript
const apolloClient = new ApolloClient({
    uri: 'https://my-graphql-server.com/graphql',
    cache: new InMemoryCache(),
});
```

Make sure to replace `https://my-graphql-server.com/graphql` with the actual endpoint of your GraphQL server.

If you don't have a GraphQL server set up yet, you can follow the instructions in the Apollo Client documentation to set up a server and use it with your client.
