You can use the `border-t` class instead of `border` to apply the border only to the top of the element. Here's an example:

```html
<div class="border-t border-blue-900 border-1">foo</div>
```

This will apply a blue border with a width of 1 pixel only to the top of the element. The `border-1` class sets the width of the border to 1 pixel. You can adjust the color and width of the border by changing the values of the `border-blue-900` and `border-1` classes, respectively.
