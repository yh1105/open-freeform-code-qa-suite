This error message usually indicates that there is a problem with the Swift compiler. Here are some steps you can try to resolve the issue:

1. Clean the project: Go to Product > Clean Build Folder in Xcode. This will delete all the intermediate build files and force Xcode to rebuild everything from scratch.

2. Delete derived data: Go to Xcode > Preferences > Locations and click on the arrow next to the Derived Data folder. This will open the folder in Finder. Delete the contents of this folder.

3. Update CocoaPods: Make sure you have the latest version of CocoaPods installed by running `sudo gem install cocoapods` in the Terminal.

4. Update pods: Run `pod update` in the Terminal to update all the pods in your project to their latest versions.

5. Check for errors in your code: Look for any errors or warnings in your code that might be causing the compiler to fail. Fix them and try building the project again.

6. Check for conflicting pods: Make sure that none of the pods in your project have conflicting dependencies. You can use the `pod outdated` command to check for outdated dependencies and the `pod deintegrate` command to remove all the pods from your project and start fresh.

If none of these steps work, you can try creating a new Xcode project and adding your code and pods to it to see if the issue persists.
