The error message indicates that the Lambda function is unable to find the executable file `main` in the `/var/task` directory. This is because the executable file was built on a Windows platform and is not compatible with the Linux environment that Lambda runs on.

To resolve this issue, you need to build the executable file on a Linux environment or use a cross-compiler to build the executable file that is compatible with the Linux environment.

Here are the steps to build a compatible executable file using a cross-compiler:

1. Install the Go cross-compiler for Linux on your Windows machine. You can download it from the official Go website: https://golang.org/dl/

2. Set the environment variables for the cross-compiler. Open a command prompt and run the following commands:

```
set GOOS=linux
set GOARCH=amd64
```

3. Build the executable file using the cross-compiler. Run the following command:

```
go build -o main main.go
```

This will create an executable file named `main` that is compatible with the Linux environment.

4. Zip the executable file and any dependencies. Run the following command:

```
zip main.zip main
```

This will create a zip file named `main.zip` that contains the executable file `main`.

5. Upload the zip file to your Lambda function and test it.

After following these steps, your Lambda function should be able to find and execute the `main` executable file without any issues.
