The warning is caused by the null-safety feature in Dart. The value returned by `myMap[1]` is of type `String?` which means it can be either a `String` or `null`. To solve the warning, you can either change the type of the variable `s` to `String?` or use a null-aware operator like `!` to tell the compiler that you are sure the value is not null. Here are two ways to solve the warning:

1. Change the type of the variable `s` to `String?`:
```dart
void foo(Map<int, String> myMap) {
  if (myMap.containsKey(1)) {
    String? s = myMap[1];
  }
}
```

2. Use a null-aware operator `!` to tell the compiler that you are sure the value is not null:
```dart
void foo(Map<int, String> myMap) {
  if (myMap.containsKey(1)) {
    String s = myMap[1]!;
  }
}
``` 

Note that using the null-aware operator `!` can cause a runtime error if the value is actually null. So, you should only use it when you are sure the value is not null.
