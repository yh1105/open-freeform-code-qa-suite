This error occurs because the latest version of Devise (4.8.0) is not compatible with Rails 4.2. You can either upgrade your Rails version to a more recent one or downgrade your Devise version to a compatible one.

To downgrade your Devise version, you can specify the version number in your Gemfile like this:

```
gem 'devise', '~> 4.7.3'
```

Then run `bundle install` to install the specified version of Devise.

If you want to upgrade your Rails version, you can update your Gemfile to specify a more recent version of Rails and then run `bundle update rails` to update your Rails version.

```
gem 'rails', '~> 5.2.0'
```

After updating your Rails version, you can then install the latest version of Devise by running `bundle install`.
