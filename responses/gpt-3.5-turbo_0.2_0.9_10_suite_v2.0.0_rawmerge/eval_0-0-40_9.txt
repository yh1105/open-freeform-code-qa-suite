The error message you are seeing indicates that there is an issue with the line endings in the `npm` file. This is a common issue when using files created in Windows on a Unix-based system like Ubuntu.

To fix this issue, you can try the following steps:

1. Open the `npm` file in a text editor like `nano` or `vim`:

```
sudo nano /mnt/c/Program\ Files/nodejs/npm
```

2. Convert the line endings to Unix format by running the following command:

```
sudo apt-get install dos2unix
sudo dos2unix /mnt/c/Program\ Files/nodejs/npm
```

3. Save and close the file.

4. Try running `npm -v` again to see if the issue has been resolved.

If this does not work, you can try uninstalling and reinstalling `npm` using the following commands:

```
sudo apt-get remove npm
sudo apt-get install npm
```

This should install the latest version of `npm` and set it up correctly.
