Yes, in Flutter you can use the `VerticalDivider` widget to draw vertical lines between components. 

Here's an example of how to use it:

```
Row(
  children: <Widget>[
    Text('Component 1'),
    VerticalDivider(),
    Text('Component 2'),
  ],
)
```

This will display "Component 1" followed by a vertical line and then "Component 2". You can customize the appearance of the `VerticalDivider` using its properties, such as `thickness` and `color`.
