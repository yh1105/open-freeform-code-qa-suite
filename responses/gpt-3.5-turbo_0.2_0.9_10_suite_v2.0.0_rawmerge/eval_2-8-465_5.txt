The `ext-zip` package is not a regular package that can be installed via Composer. It is a PHP extension that needs to be installed on your server or local machine.

To install the `ext-zip` extension, you need to follow these steps:

1. Find out which version of PHP you are using by running the following command in your terminal:

   ```
   php -v
   ```

2. Once you know which version of PHP you are using, you need to install the `zip` extension for that version of PHP. For example, if you are using PHP 7.4, you can install the `zip` extension by running the following command:

   ```
   sudo apt-get install php7.4-zip
   ```

   Note: The command may vary depending on your operating system and the version of PHP you are using.

3. After installing the `zip` extension, you need to restart your web server or PHP-FPM service. For example, if you are using Apache, you can restart it by running the following command:

   ```
   sudo service apache2 restart
   ```

   Note: The command may vary depending on your operating system and the web server you are using.

Once you have installed the `zip` extension and restarted your web server or PHP-FPM service, you should be able to use the `zip` functions in your PHP code without any issues.
