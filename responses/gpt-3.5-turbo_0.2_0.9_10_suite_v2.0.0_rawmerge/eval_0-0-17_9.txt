Sure! Here's how you can add an event listener for the "enter" key in Tiptap:

```javascript
mounted() {
  let editor = new Editor({
    extensions: [StarterKit],
    content: this.value,
    onKeyDown: (event, editor) => {
      if (event.key === 'Enter') {
        console.log("good");
        // Add your code to submit the chat and clear the editor here
      }
    }
  });
  this.editor = editor;
}
```

This code adds an `onKeyDown` event listener to the editor instance, which fires whenever a key is pressed. The function checks if the key pressed was the "Enter" key, and if so, it executes `console.log("good")`. You can add your code to submit the chat and clear the editor inside the `if` statement.
