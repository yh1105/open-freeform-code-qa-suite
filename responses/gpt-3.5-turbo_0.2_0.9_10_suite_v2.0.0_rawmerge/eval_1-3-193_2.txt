This error message indicates that the Firefox browser binary location is not set properly. You can try setting the binary location explicitly using the `executable_path` argument when creating the `webdriver.Firefox()` instance. 

Here's an example:

```python
from selenium import webdriver

# Set the path to the Firefox binary
firefox_binary_path = '/path/to/firefox/binary'

# Create a Firefox webdriver instance with the binary path
browser = webdriver.Firefox(executable_path=firefox_binary_path)

# Navigate to a website
browser.get('http://www.seleniumhq.org')
```

Make sure to replace `/path/to/firefox/binary` with the actual path to the Firefox binary on your system.
