The issue is that `ContentView_Previews` is using `@State` instead of `@Binding` for the `selected` variable. Change `@State` to `@Binding` and pass a boolean value to `selected` in the preview to see the view update when the button is clicked. 

Here's the updated code:

```
struct ContentView_Previews: PreviewProvider {
    @Binding static var selected: Bool = false

    static var previews: some View {
        ContentView(isSelected: $selected)
    }
}
```
