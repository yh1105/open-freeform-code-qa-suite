You can use the `groupby` method of pandas DataFrame to group the rows by column A and then use the `idxmin` method to get the index of the row with the minimum value in column B for each group. Finally, you can use the `loc` method to select the rows with these indices.

Here's the implementation of the `getMin` function:

```python
import pandas as pd

def getMin(df):
    idx = df.groupby(['A'])['B'].idxmin()
    result = df.loc[idx]
    return result
```

You can call this function with the DataFrame `df` as the argument:

```python
df = pd.DataFrame({'A': [1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2],
                   'B': [4, 5, 2, 7, 4, 6],
                   'C': [3, 4, 10, 2, 4, 6]})

result = getMin(df)
print(result)
```

This will output:

```
   A  B   C
2  1  2  10
4  2  4   4
```
