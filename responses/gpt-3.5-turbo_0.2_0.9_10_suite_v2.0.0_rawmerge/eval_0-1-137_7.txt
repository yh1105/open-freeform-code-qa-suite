The issue is with the syntax of your `$theme-colors` map. You need to use a colon `:` instead of an equal sign `=` to separate the key and value pairs. Here's the corrected code:

```scss
@import "../../node_modules/bootstrap/scss/variables";

$theme-colors: (
  "primary": #your-color-here,
);

@import "../../node_modules/bootstrap/scss/bootstrap";
```

Replace `#your-color-here` with the color you want to use for the primary theme color.

Also, make sure you have installed the required dependencies for SASS to work properly. You can install them using the following command:

```
npm install sass sass-loader --save-dev
```

After that, you can compile your SCSS file to CSS using the following command:

```
sass style.scss custom.css
```

This will compile your `style.scss` file to `custom.css` file.
