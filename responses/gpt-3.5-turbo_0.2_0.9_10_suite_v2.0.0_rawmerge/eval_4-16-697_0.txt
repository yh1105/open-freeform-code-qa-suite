When you run the container with `docker run IMAGE_NAME`, it starts a new shell session, which does not source the `~/.bashrc` file. To source the `~/.bashrc` file, you can add the following line to your `launch.sh` script:

```
source /root/.bashrc
```

This will ensure that the `nvm` script is loaded and the `node` command is available in your container.
