You can use the `group-hover` variant in Tailwind to apply styles to an element when its parent is being hovered over. Here's an example of how you can achieve the animation effect you're looking for:

```html
<a href="#" class="group text-sky-600 relative">
  Link
  <span class="absolute bottom-0 left-0 w-full h-0.5 bg-sky-600 transition duration-500 group-hover:h-full"></span>
</a>
```

In this code, we've added the `relative` class to the link container, and the `absolute` class to the span element that will be animated. We've also set the `bottom-0` and `left-0` properties to make sure the span element is positioned at the bottom of the link container.

To trigger the animation, we've added the `group-hover:h-full` class to the span element. This will make the element expand to its full height when the link container is being hovered over.

Finally, we've removed the `max-w-0` and `h-0.5` classes from the span element, since they're no longer needed.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.
