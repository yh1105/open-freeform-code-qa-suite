This warning is related to Elasticsearch's built-in security features not being enabled. Without authentication, your Elasticsearch cluster could be accessible to anyone. 

To fix this, you need to enable Elasticsearch security. Here are the steps to enable security:

1. Open your Elasticsearch configuration file. In a Rails app, this file is usually located at `config/elasticsearch.yml`.

2. Add the following lines to the file:

   ```
   xpack.security.enabled: true
   xpack.security.transport.ssl.enabled: true
   ```

3. Save the file and restart Elasticsearch.

After restarting Elasticsearch, the warning should disappear. 

Note: If you're using Elasticsearch version 7.13.1 or later, you'll need to use the `xpack.security` settings instead of the deprecated `security` settings.
