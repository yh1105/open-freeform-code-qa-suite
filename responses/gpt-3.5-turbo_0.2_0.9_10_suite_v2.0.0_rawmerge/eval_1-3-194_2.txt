To write a list of lists into an Excel file, we can use the `openpyxl` library in Python. Here's the implementation of the `writeExcel()` function:

```python
import openpyxl

def writeExcel():
    new_list = [["first", "second"], ["third", "fourth"]]
    wb = openpyxl.Workbook()
    sheet = wb.active
    for row in new_list:
        sheet.append(row)
    wb.save("data.xlsx")
```

In this function, we first create a list of lists `new_list` containing the data that we want to write to the Excel file. Then, we create a new workbook object using the `openpyxl.Workbook()` method. We get the active sheet of the workbook using the `wb.active` attribute.

Next, we iterate over each row in the `new_list` and append it to the sheet using the `sheet.append()` method. Finally, we save the workbook to a file named "data.xlsx" using the `wb.save()` method.

You can call this function to create an Excel file and write the data to it.
