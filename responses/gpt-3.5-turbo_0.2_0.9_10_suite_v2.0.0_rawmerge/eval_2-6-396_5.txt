The error message is caused by the `user.HasIndex(x => x.Gender);` line in your `OnModelCreating` method. You cannot create an index on a navigation property, which is what `Gender` is in the `User` entity.

To solve this problem, you can remove the `user.HasIndex(x => x.Gender);` line from your `OnModelCreating` method. If you need to create an index on the `GenderId` property, you can do it like this:

```c#
protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder modelBuilder)
{
    modelBuilder.Entity<User>(user =>
    {
        user
        .HasOne(x => x.Gender)
        .WithMany(x => x.Users)
        .HasForeignKey(x => x.GenderId);

        user.HasIndex(x => x.GenderId);
    }
}
```

This will create an index on the `GenderId` property, which is the foreign key to the `Gender` entity.
