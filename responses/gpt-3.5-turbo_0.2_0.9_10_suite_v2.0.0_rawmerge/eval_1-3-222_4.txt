Here's the Python code to compute the number of ways to form a string of length n using k characters such that at most two adjacent characters can be same:

```python
def func(n, k):
    if n == 1:
        return k
    if n == 2:
        return k * k
    dp = [0] * (n + 1)
    dp[1] = k
    dp[2] = k * k
    for i in range(3, n + 1):
        dp[i] = (k - 1) * (dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2])
    return dp[n]
```

The function uses dynamic programming to compute the number of ways to form a string of length n using k characters such that at most two adjacent characters can be same. The base cases are when n is 1 and 2, where the number of ways is simply k and k * k, respectively. For n > 2, the function uses the recurrence relation dp[i] = (k - 1) * (dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2]), where dp[i] represents the number of ways to form a string of length i. The (k - 1) factor is used to ensure that no more than two adjacent characters are the same. Finally, the function returns dp[n], which is the number of ways to form a string of length n.
