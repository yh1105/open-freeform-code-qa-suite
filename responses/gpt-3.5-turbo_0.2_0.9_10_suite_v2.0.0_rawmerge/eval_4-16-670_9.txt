Yes, you can convert your OpenSSH private key to an RSA private key using the `ssh-keygen` command on your Mac. Here are the steps:

1. Open Terminal on your Mac.
2. Run the following command to convert your OpenSSH private key to an RSA private key:

   ```
   ssh-keygen -p -m PEM -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa
   ```

   This command will prompt you to enter the passphrase for your private key. Enter the passphrase and press Enter.

3. After entering the passphrase, you will see a prompt asking you to enter a new passphrase (or leave it blank for no passphrase). You can either enter a new passphrase or leave it blank and press Enter.

4. The command will then convert your OpenSSH private key to an RSA private key and save it to `~/.ssh/id_rsa`. The new private key will have the header `-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----`.

5. You do not need to transfer your `id_rsa.pub` file as it is just the public key that corresponds to your private key. The server administrator should already have your public key on the server.

Note: It's always a good practice to backup your original private key before making any changes. You can do this by copying your `id_rsa` file to a different location on your Mac.
