With Font Awesome 5, the syntax for using icons in CSS has changed. You need to use the `font-family` property with the value of `"Font Awesome 5 Free"` or `"Font Awesome 5 Pro"` depending on the version you are using. Additionally, you need to use the `content` property with the value of the icon's Unicode value, which you can find on the Font Awesome website.

Here's an example of how you can update your CSS code to work with Font Awesome 5:

```css
#mainNav .navbar-collapse .navbar-sidenav .nav-link-collapse:after {
  float: right;
  content: "\f107";
  font-family: "Font Awesome 5 Free";
}
```

In this example, we're using the `Font Awesome 5 Free` font family and the Unicode value for the icon you want to use. You can find the Unicode value for any icon on the Font Awesome website by clicking on the icon and looking for the value in the code snippet provided.
