In Rust, the caret operator (`^`) is not used for exponentiation. Instead, you can use the `pow` method from the `num` crate. Here's an example:

```rust
use num::pow;

fn main() {
    let x = 2;
    let y = 3;
    let result = pow(x, y);
    println!("{}", result); // prints 8
}
```

In this example, we import the `pow` function from the `num` crate and use it to raise `x` to the power of `y`. The result is then printed to the console.

Alternatively, you can use the built-in `pow` method of the `i32` type:

```rust
fn main() {
    let x = 2;
    let y = 3;
    let result = i32::pow(x, y);
    println!("{}", result); // prints 8
}
```

In this example, we call the `pow` method of the `i32` type and pass in `x` and `y` as arguments. The result is then printed to the console.
