This error occurs because `reference` method has been removed from `ActiveSupport::Dependencies` module in Rails 6.0. To fix this issue, you need to upgrade your devise gem to version 4.8.1 or higher. 

To do this, update your `Gemfile` with the following line:

```
gem 'devise', '~> 4.8.1'
```

Then run `bundle update devise` to update the gem.

After updating the gem, restart your Rails server and try again. The error should be resolved.
