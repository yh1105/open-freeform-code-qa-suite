In Rust, a `Box` cannot be null. Instead, it can be empty, which means it does not own any value. To check if a `Box` is empty, you can use the `is_none` method. Here's an example:

```rust
struct Node {
    value: i32,
    next: Option<Box<Node>>,
}

struct Stack {
    top: Option<Box<Node>>,
}

fn main() {
    let stack = Stack { top: None };
    if stack.top.is_none() {
        println!("Stack is empty");
    }
}
```

In this example, the `next` field of `Node` is an `Option<Box<Node>>`, which means it can be either `None` or `Some(boxed_node)`. Similarly, the `top` field of `Stack` is an `Option<Box<Node>>`. When the stack is empty, `top` is set to `None`. You can check if `top` is empty using the `is_none` method.
