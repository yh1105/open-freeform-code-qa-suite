The error message indicates that the table "Keys" is missing in the database. This can happen if the database schema was not updated correctly during the upgrade process.

To solve this problem, you can try the following steps:

1. Make sure that the database connection string in your ASP.NET project is pointing to the correct database.

2. Open the Package Manager Console in Visual Studio and run the following command to update the database schema:

   ```
   Update-Database
   ```

   This command will apply any pending migrations to the database and update the schema to match the latest version.

3. If the "Keys" table is still missing after running the update command, you can try creating it manually by running the following SQL script in a database management tool:

   ```
   CREATE TABLE "Keys" (
       "Id" INTEGER NOT NULL CONSTRAINT "PK_Keys" PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
       "Algorithm" TEXT NOT NULL,
       "Created" TEXT NOT NULL,
       "Data" TEXT NOT NULL,
       "DataProtected" TEXT NULL,
       "IsX509Certificate" INTEGER NOT NULL,
       "Use" TEXT NOT NULL,
       "Version" TEXT NOT NULL
   );
   ```

   This will create the "Keys" table with the required columns.

4. After creating the table, you can run the update command again to make sure that the database schema is up to date:

   ```
   Update-Database
   ```

   This should resolve the error and allow your ASP.NET project to connect to the database successfully.
