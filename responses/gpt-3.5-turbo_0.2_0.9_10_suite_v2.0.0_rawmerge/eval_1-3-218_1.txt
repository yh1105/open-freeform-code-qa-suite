You can use the `str.replace()` method of pandas to remove the special characters from the end of each row in the "LGA" column. Here's the code for the `remove()` function:

```python
def remove(df):
    df['LGA'] = df['LGA'].str.replace(r'\s*\([^)]*\)', '')
    return df
```

In this function, we are using the regular expression `\s*\([^)]*\)` to match any whitespace followed by a set of parentheses containing any characters except a closing parenthesis. The `str.replace()` method replaces all occurrences of this pattern with an empty string, effectively removing the special characters from the end of each row.

You can call this function with your DataFrame variable `df` as the argument to get the desired output.
