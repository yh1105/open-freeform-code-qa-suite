You can use the `sort_by` method of the `Vec` to sort the vector by multiple fields. Here's an example of how to sort your `my_vector` by `row` and then by `column`:

```rust
my_vector.sort_by(|a, b| a.row.cmp(&b.row).then(a.column.cmp(&b.column)));
```

This will sort the vector first by `row` in ascending order, and then by `column` in ascending order. If you want to sort by `row` in descending order, you can use the `reverse` method of the `Ord` trait:

```rust
my_vector.sort_by(|a, b| b.row.cmp(&a.row).then(a.column.cmp(&b.column)));
```

This will sort the vector first by `row` in descending order, and then by `column` in ascending order.
