The error message indicates that the Docker image is not able to find the `app` module. This could be due to incorrect path or missing files. Here are some possible solutions:

1. Make sure that the `app` folder is in the same directory as the `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml` files.

2. Check the path of the `app` module in the `CMD` command. It should be `app.main:app` if your `main.py` file is inside the `app` folder.

3. Check if the `requirements.txt` file includes all the necessary dependencies for your application.

4. Try rebuilding the Docker image using the following command:

   ```
   docker-compose build
   ```

   This will rebuild the image and install all the dependencies specified in the `requirements.txt` file.

Here's an updated version of your Dockerfile that includes these changes:

```Dockerfile
FROM python:3.8
WORKDIR /app

COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

COPY app app

EXPOSE 8000
CMD ["uvicorn", "app.main:app", "--host=0.0.0.0", "--port", "8000"]
```

Note that the `--reload` option is removed from the `CMD` command as it's not recommended for production use.
