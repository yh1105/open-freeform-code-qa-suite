The error message indicates that your app is not using AndroidX, which is a major change in the Android ecosystem that provides new features and performance improvements. To fix this issue, you need to migrate your app to AndroidX.

To migrate your app to AndroidX, you can follow these steps:

1. Open your project in Android Studio.
2. Click on Refactor > Migrate to AndroidX.
3. Android Studio will analyze your project and show you a preview of the changes that will be made.
4. Click on Do Refactor to start the migration process.

After the migration process is complete, you can try building your app again using the `flutter build appbundle` command. If you still encounter issues, you can try the following steps:

1. Delete the `build` folder in your project directory.
2. Run `flutter clean` to clear the build cache.
3. Run `flutter build appbundle` again.

This should generate the Android project study and its APK successfully.
