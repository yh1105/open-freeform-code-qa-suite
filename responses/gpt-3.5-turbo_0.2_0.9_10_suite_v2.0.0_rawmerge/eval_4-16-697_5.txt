When you run the container with `docker run IMAGE_NAME`, it starts a new shell session, which does not execute the `~/.bashrc` file. To source the `~/.bashrc` file, you can add the following line to your `launch.sh` script before running the `npm` command:

```
source /root/.bashrc
```

This will load the environment variables and aliases defined in the `~/.bashrc` file.
