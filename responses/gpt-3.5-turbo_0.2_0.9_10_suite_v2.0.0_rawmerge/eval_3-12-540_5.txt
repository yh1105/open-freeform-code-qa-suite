Yes, in Flutter you can use the `VerticalDivider` widget to draw a vertical line between components. 

Here's an example of how to use it:

```
Row(
  children: <Widget>[
    Expanded(
      child: Container(
        height: 50,
        color: Colors.blue,
      ),
    ),
    VerticalDivider(
      color: Colors.grey,
      thickness: 1,
    ),
    Expanded(
      child: Container(
        height: 50,
        color: Colors.red,
      ),
    ),
  ],
)
```

This code will create a `Row` with two `Container` widgets separated by a vertical line (`VerticalDivider`). The `color` property sets the color of the line, and the `thickness` property sets the width of the line.
