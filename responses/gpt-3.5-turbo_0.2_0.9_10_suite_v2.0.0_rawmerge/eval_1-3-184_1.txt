Sure, here's a function that should do what you're asking for using `openpyxl`:

```python
import openpyxl

def filterExcelRows(filePath, matchedString):
    # Load the workbook
    workbook = openpyxl.load_workbook(filePath)

    # Select the sheet
    sheet = workbook['Sheet1']

    # Find the rows that contain the matched string
    rows = []
    for row in sheet.iter_rows():
        for cell in row:
            if cell.value == matchedString:
                rows.append(row)
                break

    # Copy the contents of each cell in the matching rows to a variable
    result = []
    for row in rows:
        row_contents = []
        for cell in row:
            row_contents.append(cell.value)
        result.append(row_contents)

    return result
```

This function loads the Excel workbook, selects the `Sheet1` sheet, and then iterates over all cells in the sheet to find those that contain the `matchedString`. It then copies the contents of each cell in the matching rows to a variable and returns it as a list of lists.
