The error message `HTTP Error 410: Gone` indicates that the video you are trying to download is no longer available on YouTube. This could be due to various reasons such as the video being removed by the uploader, the video being age-restricted, or the video being blocked in your country.

You can try to download a different video to see if the issue persists. If the issue persists, you can try using a VPN to change your location and see if the video is available in a different country. If none of these solutions work, it is likely that the video is no longer available and cannot be downloaded.
