It seems like the issue is with the way you are running the Vite server inside the Docker container. By default, Vite binds to `localhost` which means it can only be accessed from within the container itself. To make it accessible from outside the container, you need to bind it to `0.0.0.0` which will allow it to listen on all network interfaces.

To do this, you can modify your `vite.config.ts` file to include the `host` option:

```typescript
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import vue from '@vitejs/plugin-vue'

// https://vitejs.dev/config/
export default defineConfig({
    resolve: { alias: { '@': '/src' } },
    plugins: [vue()],
    server: {
        port: 8080,
        host: '0.0.0.0'
    }
})
```

This will allow the Vite server to listen on all network interfaces and be accessible from outside the container.

Once you've made this change, you can rebuild your Docker image and run the container again:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

Then try accessing the server from your host machine using `localhost:8080` and it should work.
