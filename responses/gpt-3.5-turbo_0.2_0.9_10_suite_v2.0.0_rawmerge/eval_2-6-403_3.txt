You can use the `JsonResult` class to return JSON with a HTTP status code in your .NET Core Web API controller. Here's an example:

```c#
public JsonResult IsAuthenticated()
{
    return new JsonResult("123")
    {
        StatusCode = 200
    };
}
```

In this example, we're creating a new `JsonResult` object and passing in the JSON data as a parameter. We're then setting the `StatusCode` property to `200` to indicate a successful response.

You can also use the `Ok` method to return a JSON result with a HTTP status code like this:

```c#
public IActionResult IsAuthenticated()
{
    return Ok("123");
}
```

The `Ok` method returns an `OkObjectResult` object, which is a type of `IActionResult` that represents a successful response with an object as the result. The `OkObjectResult` class automatically serializes the object to JSON and sets the HTTP status code to `200`.
