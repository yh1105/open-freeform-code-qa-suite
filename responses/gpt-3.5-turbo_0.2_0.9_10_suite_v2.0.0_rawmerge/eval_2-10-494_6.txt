This error is caused by a bug in rust-analyzer, which is a language server for Rust that provides IDE-like features such as code completion and error highlighting. The error message is indicating that rust-analyzer is having trouble resolving the `format_args` macro, which is used internally by the `pad_str` function.

Fortunately, this error does not indicate a problem with your code, and you can safely ignore it. If your code compiles and passes tests, then it is working correctly.

If you want to get rid of the error message, you can try updating rust-analyzer to the latest version, or disabling it entirely. To disable rust-analyzer, add the following line to your `Cargo.toml` file:

```
[package.metadata]
rust-analyzer = false
```

This will prevent Cargo from using rust-analyzer when building your project.
