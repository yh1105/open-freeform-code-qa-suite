You can create a calendar input in VBA Excel without using any external ocx files by creating a userform with a calendar control. You can add a calendar control to the userform by selecting "Microsoft Date and Time Picker Control" from the "Additional Controls" list in the VBA editor. Then, you can customize the userform and calendar control properties to fit your needs. Finally, you can write VBA code to handle the user's selection from the calendar control.
