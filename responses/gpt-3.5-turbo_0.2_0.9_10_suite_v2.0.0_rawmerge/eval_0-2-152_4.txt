You need to use the `toast()` method to show the toast. Here's an example of how you can show the toast using jQuery:

```javascript
$('.toast').toast('show');
```

You can add this code to an event handler or function that triggers the toast to show up. For example, you can add it to a button click event like this:

```javascript
$('#myButton').click(function() {
  $('.toast').toast('show');
});
```

Make sure you have included the necessary Bootstrap and jQuery files in your HTML file.
