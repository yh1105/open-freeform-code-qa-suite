It's possible that the issue is related to the dynamic route. When deploying to Vercel, you need to make sure that all pages are pre-rendered. This means that dynamic routes need to be statically generated at build time, rather than being generated on the fly at runtime.

To fix this issue, you can try the following steps:

1. Create a `next.config.js` file in the root of your project if you don't have one already.
2. Add the following code to the `next.config.js` file:

```
module.exports = {
  async rewrites() {
    return [
      {
        source: '/:path*',
        destination: '/api/:path*',
      },
    ]
  },
}
```

This code will rewrite all requests to dynamic routes to an API route. This will allow you to pre-render the pages and avoid the 404 error.

3. Run `yarn run build` to build your app.
4. Deploy your app to Vercel.

With these steps, your app should be able to deploy successfully to Vercel.
