The error message you are seeing is related to ESLint, which is a popular tool for linting JavaScript and TypeScript code. It seems that ESLint is unable to find your `tsconfig.json` file, which is referenced in your `.eslintrc.js` file.

To fix this issue, you can try the following steps:

1. Make sure that your `tsconfig.json` file is located in the root directory of your project. If it is not, you will need to update the `project` property in your `.eslintrc.js` file to point to the correct location of your `tsconfig.json` file.

2. Check that the file path in the error message is correct. If it is not, you will need to update the path in your `.eslintrc.js` file to match the correct location of your `tsconfig.json` file.

3. If the above steps do not work, you can try adding the following line to your `.eslintrc.js` file:

   ```javascript
   root: true,
   ```

   This tells ESLint to stop looking for configuration files in parent directories, which may be causing the issue.

After making any changes to your `.eslintrc.js` file, make sure to save the file and restart your editor to see if the error message disappears.
