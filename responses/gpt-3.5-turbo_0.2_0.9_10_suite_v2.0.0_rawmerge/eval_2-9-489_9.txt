This warning is related to Elasticsearch's built-in security features not being enabled, which could potentially make your cluster accessible to anyone. To fix this, you can enable Elasticsearch security by following these steps:

1. Open the Elasticsearch configuration file located at `config/elasticsearch.yml`.
2. Add the following lines to the file:

```
xpack.security.enabled: true
```

3. Save the file and restart Elasticsearch.

If you're using Searchkick with Rails, you may need to update your Searchkick configuration to include the Elasticsearch username and password. You can do this by adding the following lines to your `config/initializers/searchkick.rb` file:

```
Searchkick.client_options = {
  user: "elastic",
  password: "your_password_here"
}
```

Replace `your_password_here` with your Elasticsearch password.

Note: If you're using Elasticsearch version 7.11 or later, you'll need to install the Elasticsearch security plugin separately. You can do this by running the following command:

```
bin/elasticsearch-plugin install -b https://d3g5vo6xdbdb9a.cloudfront.net/downloads/elasticsearch-plugins/security/security-7.13.1.zip
```

After installing the plugin, you can enable security by following the steps above.
