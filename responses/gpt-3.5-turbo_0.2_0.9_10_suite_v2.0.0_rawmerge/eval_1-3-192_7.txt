Here's the Python code to solve the problem:

```python
def to_camel_case(text):
    if not text:
        return ""
    words = re.split(r'[-_]', text)
    return words[0] + ''.join(word.capitalize() for word in words[1:])
```

We first check if the input string is empty, in which case we return an empty string. We then split the string using the regular expression `r'[-_]'`, which matches either a dash or an underscore. This gives us a list of words. We then capitalize each word except the first one, and join them back together to form the camel case string.

Here's how you can test the function:

```python
print(to_camel_case(''))  # Output: ''
print(to_camel_case("the_stealth_warrior"))  # Output: theStealthWarrior
print(to_camel_case("The-Stealth-Warrior"))  # Output: TheStealthWarrior
print(to_camel_case("A-B-C"))  # Output: ABC
```
