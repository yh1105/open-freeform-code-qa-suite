Your approach is correct, but you need to add 4 to the index returned by `lastIndexOf` to include the "-354" sequence in the final output. Here's the corrected code:

```
$FileArray = @("Name1-354-03.pdf", "Name23-354-H11.pdf", "Name354-354-02.pdf", "Name3545-354.pdf")
ForEach ($n in $FileArray){
     Write-Host $n.Substring(0, $n.lastIndexOf('-354')+4)
}
```

This should give you the desired output:

```
Name1-354
Name23-354
Name354-354
Name3545-354
```
