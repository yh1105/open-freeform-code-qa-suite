The issue with your code is that you are checking if the entire input string is present in the `correct` string, which is not what you want. Instead, you should check if all characters in the input string are in the `correct` string.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
import string

def checkString(text):
    correct = string.ascii_letters + string.digits
    return all(char in correct for char in text)

text = input("Enter: ")
if checkString(text):
    print("Success")
else:
    print("Failure")
```

In this code, the `checkString` function takes a string `text` as input and returns `True` if all characters in the string are either letters or digits, and `False` otherwise.

The `all` function is used to check if all characters in the string satisfy the condition. It returns `True` if all elements in the iterable are true, and `False` otherwise.

You can call this function with any string as input to check if it satisfies the condition.
