To add Jetpack Compose to an existing Android Studio project, you need to do the following:

1. Update your project to use Android Studio 4.2 or later.
2. Add the following lines to your app's `build.gradle` file:

```
android {
    ...
    buildFeatures {
        compose true
    }
    ...
}

dependencies {
    ...
    implementation 'androidx.compose.ui:ui:1.0.0'
    implementation 'androidx.compose.material:material:1.0.0'
    implementation 'androidx.compose.runtime:runtime-livedata:1.0.0'
    implementation 'androidx.activity:activity-compose:1.3.0'
    ...
}
```

3. Sync your project with Gradle.

After that, you can start using Jetpack Compose in your existing project.
