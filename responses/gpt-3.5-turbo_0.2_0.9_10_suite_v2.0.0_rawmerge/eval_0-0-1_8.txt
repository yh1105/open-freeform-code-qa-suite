It's possible that the issue is related to the dynamic route, but it's hard to say without more information. Here are a few things you can try:

1. Make sure you have a `next.config.js` file in the root of your project. Even if you don't need to customize any settings, Next.js requires this file to be present in order to build and deploy your app.

2. Check your `package.json` file and make sure that the `start` script is set to `next start`. This is the command that Vercel will use to start your app.

3. If you're using dynamic routes, make sure that you're using the correct file naming convention. For example, if you have a dynamic route called `pages/posts/[id].js`, then your API route should be called `pages/api/posts/[id].js`. Note that the file names should match exactly, including the capitalization.

4. Check your Vercel logs to see if there are any error messages that might give you a clue as to what's going wrong. You can access your logs by clicking on the "Logs" button in the Vercel dashboard.

5. If none of the above steps work, try creating a new Next.js app from scratch and deploying it to Vercel to see if you can reproduce the issue. This might help you narrow down the problem.
