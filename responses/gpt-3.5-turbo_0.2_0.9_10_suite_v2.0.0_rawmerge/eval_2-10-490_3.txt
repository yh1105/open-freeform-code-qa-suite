Yes, there is a better way to write this code. You can use the `?` operator to simplify the nested `if let` statements. Here's an example of how you can refactor the code using the `?` operator:

```rust
if let Some(i) = func1() {
    if let Some(j) = func2(i)? {
        if let Some(k) = func3(j)? {
            if let Some(result) = func4(k)? {
                // Do something with result
            } else {
                println!("func 4 returned None");
            }
        } else {
            println!("func 3 returned None");
        }
    } else {
        println!("func 2 returned None");
    }
} else {
    println!("func 1 returned None");
}
```

With the `?` operator, if any of the functions return `None`, the entire expression will evaluate to `None` and the code will jump to the appropriate `else` block. This makes the code much more readable and easier to follow.
