It sounds like you might be trying to use a CSS preprocessor like Sass or Less. These preprocessors allow you to write CSS in a more efficient way by using variables, mixins, and other features. One of the features they offer is the ability to use shorthand notation to create CSS rules.

For example, instead of writing out:

```
div {
  background-color: red;
  color: white;
  font-size: 16px;
}
```

You could write:

```
div {
  background-color: red;
  color: white;
  font-size: 16px;
}

.classname {
  @extend div;
}
```

This would create a CSS rule for `.classname` that inherits all the properties of `div`. When you use `.classname` in your HTML, it will automatically have the same styles as `div`.

If you're not using a preprocessor and you're just trying to use shorthand notation in regular CSS, make sure you're using the correct syntax. For example, to create a class with the same styles as `div`, you would write:

```
.classname {
  background-color: red;
  color: white;
  font-size: 16px;
}
```

Then you can use `<div class="classname">` in your HTML to apply those styles to the div.
