It sounds like you might be referring to Emmet, a plugin that allows you to write HTML and CSS code using shortcuts. 

To use Emmet, you can type out a shorthand code and then press the "Tab" key to expand it into the full HTML or CSS code. For example, typing `.classname` and then pressing "Tab" should expand into `<div class="classname"></div>`.

If this isn't working for you, make sure that you have Emmet installed and enabled in your code editor. The specific steps for enabling Emmet will depend on your editor, but you can usually find instructions by searching for "Emmet [your editor name] installation".

Additionally, make sure that you are typing the shorthand code correctly. Emmet has a specific syntax that you need to follow in order for it to work. You can find a list of Emmet shortcuts and syntax on the Emmet website.
