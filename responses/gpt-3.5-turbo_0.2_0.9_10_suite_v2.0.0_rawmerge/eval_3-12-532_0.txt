The `FormatException: Unexpected character` error occurs when the JSON string being decoded is not in the correct format. In your case, it seems that the response body returned by the PHP file is not a valid JSON string.

To solve this error, you can try the following steps:

1. Check the response body returned by the PHP file by printing it to the console. You can use `print(response.body)` to do this.

2. Validate the JSON string using an online JSON validator such as https://jsonlint.com/. This will help you identify any syntax errors in the JSON string.

3. If there are syntax errors in the JSON string, fix them in the PHP file so that it returns a valid JSON string.

4. If the response body is not a JSON string at all, then you need to modify the PHP file to return a valid JSON string.

Once you have a valid JSON string, you can decode it using `json.decode(response.body)` without encountering the `FormatException` error.
