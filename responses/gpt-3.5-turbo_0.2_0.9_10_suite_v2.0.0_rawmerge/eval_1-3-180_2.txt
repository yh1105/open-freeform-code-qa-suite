To filter the data based on a specific value in a column, you can use the `.loc` method in pandas. Here's an example code snippet that should work for you:

```python
pass_test_data = data_useless.loc[data_useless['TEST_STATUS'] == 'PASS TEST']
pass_test_data_grouped = pass_test_data.groupby('TEST_TYPE').count()
```

This code first filters the `data_useless` DataFrame to only include rows where the `TEST_STATUS` column is equal to `'PASS TEST'`. It then groups the resulting DataFrame by the `TEST_TYPE` column and counts the number of occurrences of each value in that column.

Note that you can also chain the filtering and grouping operations together in a single line of code, like this:

```python
pass_test_data_grouped = data_useless.loc[data_useless['TEST_STATUS'] == 'PASS TEST'].groupby('TEST_TYPE').count()
```

This will produce the same result as the previous code snippet.
