It seems that you need to properly identify the object name and type to select it using the SelectByID2 method. One way to do this is to create reference points using appropriate Selection methods, whose names are known, and then use those points for SelectByID2 method. Another option is to use the GetFaces/GetFirstFace/GetNextFace methods to obtain the face object and then use its handle for SelectByID2 method.
