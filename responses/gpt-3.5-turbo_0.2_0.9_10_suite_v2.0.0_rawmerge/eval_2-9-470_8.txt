This error occurs because the `libffi6` package is missing in Ubuntu 20.04, which is required by the `ffi` gem. To fix this issue, you can follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal and run the following command to install the `libffi7` package:

   ```
   sudo apt-get install libffi7
   ```

2. Create a symbolic link for `libffi.so.6` to `libffi.so.7` by running the following command:

   ```
   sudo ln -s /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libffi.so.7 /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libffi.so.6
   ```

3. Finally, reinstall the `ffi` gem by running the following command:

   ```
   gem uninstall ffi
   gem install ffi
   ```

After completing these steps, the `ffi` gem should work without any issues.
