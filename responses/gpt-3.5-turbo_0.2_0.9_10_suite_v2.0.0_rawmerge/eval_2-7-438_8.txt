Based on the error message, it seems like Doctrine is unable to find the migration class. Here are a few things you can try:

1. Use the full namespace of the migration class:
```
bin/console --env=dev doctrine:migrations:execute 'Application\Migrations\Version20210909072642' --down --no-interaction -vvv
```

2. Check if the migration class file exists in the correct directory:
```
app/DoctrineMigrations/Version20210909072642.php
```

3. Make sure that the migration class is properly defined with the correct namespace and class name:
```
namespace Application\Migrations;

use Doctrine\DBAL\Schema\Schema;
use Doctrine\Migrations\AbstractMigration;

class Version20210909072642 extends AbstractMigration
{
    public function up(Schema $schema): void
    {
        // ...
    }

    public function down(Schema $schema): void
    {
        // ...
    }
}
```

4. Verify that the migration has been executed by checking the `migration_versions` table in your database. If the migration has already been executed, you won't be able to rollback to it.

If none of these solutions work, you can try running the `doctrine:migrations:status` command to see if the migration is listed as "available" or "executed". This may help you identify any issues with the migration configuration.
