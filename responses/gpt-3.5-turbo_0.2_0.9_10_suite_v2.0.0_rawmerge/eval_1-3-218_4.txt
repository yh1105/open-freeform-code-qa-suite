You can use the `str.replace()` method of pandas to remove the special characters from the end of each row in the "LGA" column. Here's the code for the `remove()` function:

```python
def remove(df):
    df['LGA'] = df['LGA'].str.replace(r'\s*\([^)]*\)', '')
    return df
```

This function uses a regular expression to match any sequence of characters that starts with a space, followed by an opening parenthesis, followed by any number of characters that are not a closing parenthesis, followed by a closing parenthesis. The `str.replace()` method then replaces each match with an empty string, effectively removing it from the end of the string.

You can call this function with your DataFrame variable `df` as the argument, like this:

```python
df = remove(df)
```

This will modify the "LGA" column of `df` to remove the special characters from the end of each row.
