To read a CSV file from Google Drive, you need to modify the URL of the file. Here's how you can do it:

```python
def processURL(url):
    file_id = url.split('/')[-2]
    csv_url = f'https://drive.google.com/uc?id={file_id}&export=download'
    return csv_url
```

In this function, we first extract the file ID from the URL by splitting it and taking the second-to-last element. Then we construct a new URL by appending the file ID to `https://drive.google.com/uc?id=` and adding `&export=download` at the end. This new URL will allow us to download the CSV file directly.

You can use this function to get the CSV file URL and then read it using pandas:

```python
import pandas as pd

url = 'https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B6GhBwm5vaB2ekdlZW5WZnppb28/view?usp=sharing'
csv_url = processURL(url)
df = pd.read_csv(csv_url)
```
