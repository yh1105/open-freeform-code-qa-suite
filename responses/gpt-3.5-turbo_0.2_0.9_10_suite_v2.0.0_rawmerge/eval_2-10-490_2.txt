Yes, there is a better way to do this. You can use the `?` operator in Rust to simplify the code and make it more readable. Here's an example of how you can refactor the code using the `?` operator:

```rust
if let Some(i) = func1() {
    let j = func2(i)?;
    let k = func3(j)?;
    let result = func4(k)?;
    // Do something with result
} else {
    println!("func 1 returned None");
}
```

This code does the same thing as the original code, but it's much easier to read and understand. The `?` operator is used to propagate errors up the call stack, so if any of the functions return `None`, the code will immediately jump to the `else` block and print an error message.
