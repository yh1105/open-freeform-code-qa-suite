By default, Laravel's `dd()` function limits the output to 1024 characters. However, you can increase this limit by modifying the `outputBuffering` configuration option in your `config/app.php` file.

To increase the limit, you can set the `outputBuffering` option to a higher value, like so:

```php
'outputBuffering' => 8192,
```

This will increase the output limit to 8192 characters, which should be enough to view your nested relationships.

Alternatively, you can use the `dump()` function instead of `dd()`. The `dump()` function will output the entire variable without any limits. However, it won't stop the execution of your code like `dd()` does. So, you'll need to manually remove the `dump()` function after you've finished debugging.
