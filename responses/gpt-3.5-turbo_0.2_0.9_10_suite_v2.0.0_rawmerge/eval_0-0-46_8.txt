The error message you are seeing is related to ESLint, which is a popular tool for linting JavaScript and TypeScript code. It seems like ESLint is trying to read your `tsconfig.json` file but is unable to find it. 

To fix this issue, you need to make sure that the `tsconfig.json` file is in the root directory of your project. If it is already there, you can try specifying the path to the `tsconfig.json` file in your `.eslintrc.js` file. 

In your `.eslintrc.js` file, change the `project` property under `parserOptions` to the following:

```javascript
parserOptions: {
  project: "./tsconfig.json",
  sourceType: "module",
},
```

This should tell ESLint where to find your `tsconfig.json` file. 

If the issue persists, you can try running the following command in your terminal to clear the ESLint cache:

```
npx eslint --no-eslintrc --env node --ext .js,.ts src
```

This should clear any cached configuration and help ESLint find your `tsconfig.json` file.
