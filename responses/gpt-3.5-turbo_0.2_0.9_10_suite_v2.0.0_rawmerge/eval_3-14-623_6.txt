This error message usually indicates that there is a problem with the Swift code in your project. Here are some steps you can take to try to resolve the issue:

1. Clean your project: Go to Product > Clean in Xcode, or use the shortcut Command-Shift-K. This will delete all the build files and derived data for your project.

2. Delete the derived data: Go to Xcode > Preferences > Locations and click on the arrow next to the Derived Data folder. This will open the folder in Finder. Delete the contents of this folder.

3. Update your pods: Run `pod update` in the terminal to update all your pods to the latest version.

4. Check for any errors in your code: Look for any errors or warnings in your code, especially in the files that are causing the error. Fix any issues that you find.

5. Check for any conflicting pods: Make sure that you don't have any conflicting pods in your project. You can use the `pod outdated` command to check for any outdated or conflicting pods.

6. Try cleaning the build folder: Hold down the Option key and go to Product > Clean Build Folder. This will delete all the build files for your project.

If none of these steps work, you may need to try more advanced troubleshooting steps, such as reinstalling Xcode or Cocoapods.
