The `<experimental/filesystem>` header was introduced in C++17 as an experimental feature. In C++17, the `<experimental/filesystem>` header was included in the `<filesystem>` header. Therefore, to use the `<filesystem>` header, you should include `<filesystem>` instead of `<experimental/filesystem>`.

To fix the error, replace the following line:
```c++
#include <experimental/filesystem>
```
with:
```c++
#include <filesystem>
```

Then, you should also change the namespace from `std::experimental::filesystem` to `std::filesystem`:
```c++
for (const auto& entry: std::filesystem::directory_iterator(imageDirectory))
```

Note that you need to compile your code with the `-std=c++17` flag to enable C++17 features.
