You can use `grep` with a regular expression to match the `lang` attribute regardless of its position in the HTML tag. Here's an example command that should work for both cases:

```
curl -Ls yahoo.com | grep -oP '(?<=lang=")[^"]+' | head -1
```

This command uses the `-o` option to only output the matched string, and the `-P` option to enable Perl-compatible regular expressions. The regular expression `(?<=lang=")[^"]+` matches any sequence of characters that come after `lang="` and before the next double quote. The `head -1` command is used to only output the first match.

You can replace `yahoo.com` with any other URL you want to test.
