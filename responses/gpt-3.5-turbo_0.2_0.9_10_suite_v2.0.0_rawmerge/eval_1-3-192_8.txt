Here's the Python code to solve the problem:

```python
def to_camel_case(text):
    if not text:
        return ""
    words = re.split(r'[-_]', text)
    return words[0] + ''.join(word.capitalize() for word in words[1:])
```

This function first checks if the input string is empty, in which case it returns an empty string. Otherwise, it splits the string into words using a regular expression that matches either a dash or an underscore. It then capitalizes the first letter of each word except the first one, and concatenates the resulting words into a single string. Finally, it returns the resulting string.

You will need to import the `re` module to use regular expressions.
