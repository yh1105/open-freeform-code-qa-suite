The error message is caused by the line `user.HasIndex(x => x.Gender);`. You are trying to create an index on the `Gender` property, which is a navigation property, and EF Core doesn't support creating indexes on navigation properties.

To fix this issue, you can remove the line `user.HasIndex(x => x.Gender);` from your `OnModelCreating` method. If you need to create an index on the `GenderId` property, you can do it like this:

```c#
protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder modelBuilder)
{
    modelBuilder.Entity<User>(user =>
    {
        user
        .HasOne(x => x.Gender)
        .WithMany(x => x.Users)
        .HasForeignKey(x => x.GenderId);

        user.HasIndex(x => x.GenderId);
    });
}
```

This will create an index on the `GenderId` property, which is a foreign key to the `Gender` entity.
