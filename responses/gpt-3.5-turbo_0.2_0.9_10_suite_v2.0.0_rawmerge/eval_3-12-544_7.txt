This error occurs when the `getApplicationDocumentsDirectory()` method returns null. This can happen if the path_provider package is not properly installed or if there is an issue with the platform-specific implementation of the package.

To fix this, make sure that you have added the path_provider package to your `pubspec.yaml` file and run `flutter pub get` to install it.

If the issue persists, try running `flutter clean` to clear the build cache and then run `flutter pub get` again.

If the issue still persists, try running the app on a physical device instead of an emulator as some platform-specific features may not work properly on emulators.
