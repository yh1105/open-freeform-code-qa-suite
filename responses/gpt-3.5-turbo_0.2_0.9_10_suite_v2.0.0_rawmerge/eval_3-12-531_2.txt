The warning is caused by null safety in Dart. The value of `myMap[1]` may be null, so its type is `String?` instead of `String`. To solve the warning, you can either change the type of the variable `s` to `String?` or use a null-aware operator to handle the null case. Here are two possible solutions:

1. Change the type of `s` to `String?`:
```dart
void foo(Map<int, String> myMap) {
  if (myMap.containsKey(1)) {
    String? s = myMap[1];
  }
}
```

2. Use a null-aware operator to handle the null case:
```dart
void foo(Map<int, String> myMap) {
  String s = myMap[1] ?? '';
}
```
In this solution, if `myMap[1]` is null, the empty string `''` will be assigned to `s`.
