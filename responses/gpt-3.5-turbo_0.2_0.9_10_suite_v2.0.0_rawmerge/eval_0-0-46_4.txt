The error message indicates that ESLint is unable to find the `tsconfig.json` file. This is because the `tsconfig.json` file is located in the `src` directory, which is not included in the default ESLint configuration.

To fix this issue, you need to update the `parserOptions` section of your `.eslintrc.js` file to include the path to the `tsconfig.json` file. 

Change the `parserOptions` section to the following:

```javascript
parserOptions: {
  project: "./src/tsconfig.json",
  sourceType: "module",
},
```

This should resolve the error and allow ESLint to find the `tsconfig.json` file.
