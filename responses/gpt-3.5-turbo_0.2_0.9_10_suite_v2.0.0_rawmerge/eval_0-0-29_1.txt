To make sure the second query runs only after the first one is fulfilled, you can use the `useEffect` hook to watch for changes in the `userFulfilled` variable. Once it becomes `true`, you can then run the second query.

Here's the code for the second query:

```javascript
const [userBio, setUserBio] = useState(null);

useEffect(() => {
  if (userFulfilled && user) {
    const { data } = await useGetUserBioQuery(user.id).unwrap();
    setUserBio(data);
  }
}, [userFulfilled, user]);
```

In this code, we're using the `useState` hook to store the result of the second query. We're also using the `useEffect` hook to watch for changes in `userFulfilled` and `user`. Once both of these variables are truthy, we run the second query using `useGetUserBioQuery(user.id).unwrap()`. The `unwrap()` method is used to extract the data from the query result. Finally, we set the result of the second query using `setUserBio(data)`.
