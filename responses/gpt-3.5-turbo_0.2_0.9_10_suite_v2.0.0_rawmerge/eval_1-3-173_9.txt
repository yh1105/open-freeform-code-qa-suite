Yes, you can use the `date_range` function from pandas to create a range of dates for the given year and then calculate the length of the range to get the total number of days in the year. Here's a function `DaysInYear` that takes a year as an argument and returns the total number of days in that year:

```python
import pandas as pd

def DaysInYear(year):
    start_date = pd.to_datetime(str(year) + '-01-01')
    end_date = pd.to_datetime(str(year) + '-12-31')
    days_in_year = len(pd.date_range(start_date, end_date))
    return days_in_year
```

You can call this function with the year as an argument to get the total number of days in that year. For example:

```python
DaysInYear(2020) # returns 366
DaysInYear(2019) # returns 365
```
