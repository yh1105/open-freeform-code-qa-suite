It seems like the issue is with the way you are starting the Vite server inside the Docker container. When you run `npm run vite` inside the container, it starts the Vite server on the container's localhost, which is not accessible from outside the container.

To fix this, you need to start the Vite server with the `--host` option set to `0.0.0.0`, which will make it accessible from outside the container. You can modify the `vite` script in your `package.json` file to include this option:

```json
"vite": "vite --host 0.0.0.0"
```

Then, when you start the container, you can use the following command to publish the container's port to your host machine:

```bash
docker-compose run --publish 8080:8080 --rm app npm run vite
```

This should make the Vite server accessible at `localhost:8080` on your host machine.
