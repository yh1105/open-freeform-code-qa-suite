The error message "419 Page Expired" usually occurs when the CSRF token has expired or is invalid. This is a security feature in Laravel to prevent cross-site request forgery attacks.

To avoid this error message, you can try the following solutions:

1. Use AJAX requests for logout: Instead of using a regular form submission for logout, you can use AJAX requests to send the logout request to the server. This way, the CSRF token will be automatically included in the request headers, and you won't have to worry about the token expiring.

2. Increase the CSRF token lifetime: By default, the CSRF token lifetime in Laravel is set to 120 minutes. You can increase this value in the `config/session.php` file by changing the `lifetime` option. However, keep in mind that increasing the token lifetime also increases the risk of CSRF attacks.

3. Refresh the CSRF token on logout: When the user logs out, you can refresh the CSRF token by generating a new token and updating the session data. This way, even if the user tries to logout from another tab with an expired token, the new token will be used instead.

4. Use a stateless API for authentication: If you're building a single-page application or a mobile app, you can use a stateless API for authentication instead of relying on sessions and CSRF tokens. In this case, you would use JSON Web Tokens (JWT) or OAuth2 for authentication, which don't require CSRF tokens.
