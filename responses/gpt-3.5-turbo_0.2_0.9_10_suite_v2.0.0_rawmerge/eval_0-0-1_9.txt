If you are receiving a 404 error when deploying your NextJS app to Vercel, it is likely that your app is not being built correctly during the deployment process. Here are some steps you can take to troubleshoot the issue:

1. Check your Vercel deployment logs: When you deploy your app to Vercel, you should be able to see the deployment logs in the Vercel dashboard. Check the logs to see if there are any errors or warnings that might indicate what is causing the 404 error.

2. Check your `next.config.js` file: Even though you mentioned that you don't have a `next.config.js` file, it is possible that you might need one to properly configure your app for deployment. You can create a `next.config.js` file in the root of your project and add the following code:

```
module.exports = {
  target: 'serverless'
}
```

This will tell NextJS to build your app for serverless deployment, which is what Vercel uses.

3. Check your dynamic routes: If you have dynamic routes in your app, make sure that they are properly configured. Dynamic routes in NextJS are defined using square brackets, like this: `[id].js`. Make sure that your dynamic routes are properly defined and that they are being built correctly during the deployment process.

4. Check your `package.json` file: Make sure that your `package.json` file has the correct scripts for building and deploying your app. The `build` script should be set to `next build` and the `start` script should be set to `next start`.

If none of these steps solve the issue, you can try reaching out to the Vercel support team for further assistance.
