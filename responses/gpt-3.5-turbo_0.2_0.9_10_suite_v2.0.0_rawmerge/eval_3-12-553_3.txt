The error message indicates that your app is not using AndroidX, which is a major change in the Android ecosystem that provides new features and APIs while maintaining backward compatibility with older versions of Android. 

To fix this issue, you need to migrate your app to AndroidX. You can follow the steps provided in the error message or use the Android Studio Refactor tool to automatically migrate your app to AndroidX. 

Once you have migrated your app to AndroidX, you can try building the app again using the command:

```
flutter build appbundle
```

If you still encounter the same error, you can try cleaning the project by running the following command:

```
flutter clean
```

Then, try building the app again. If the issue persists, you can try updating your Gradle version and dependencies to the latest version. You can also check if there are any conflicting dependencies in your project and resolve them.
