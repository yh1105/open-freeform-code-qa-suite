This error occurs because pdftk is a 32-bit application and MacOS Catalina only supports 64-bit applications. Here are some possible solutions:

1. Use an alternative tool: There are many alternative tools that can perform similar tasks to pdftk, such as PDFsam, qpdf, and PDFtk Server. You can try using one of these tools instead.

2. Use a virtual machine: You can install a virtual machine on your Mac that runs an older version of MacOS that supports 32-bit applications. You can then install pdftk on the virtual machine and use it from there.

3. Use Docker: You can use Docker to run pdftk in a container. This allows you to run pdftk on your Mac without worrying about compatibility issues.

4. Use Homebrew: You can use Homebrew to install a 32-bit version of pdftk. First, install Homebrew by running the following command in Terminal:

```
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)"
```

Then, install pdftk by running the following command:

```
brew install https://raw.githubusercontent.com/turforlag/homebrew-cervezas/master/pdftk.rb
```

This will install a 32-bit version of pdftk that should work on your Mac.
