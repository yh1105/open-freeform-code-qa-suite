You can disable the automatic ordering of includes in clang-format by using the `SortIncludes` option. To disable it, set the value of `SortIncludes` to `false` in your `.clang-format` file.

Here's an example of what your `.clang-format` file should look like:

```
---
Language: Cpp
SortIncludes: false
...
```

By setting `SortIncludes` to `false`, clang-format will no longer reorder your includes. Keep in mind that this may cause issues with third-party libraries that require a specific include order, so make sure to manually order your includes correctly.
