The reason it didn't work is that this needs to be done inside a function or a method, not at the top level.

Another solution is to declare your map in Flutter with the keyword "late". Here's an example:

```dart
late Map<String, int> someMap = {
  "a": 1,
  "b": 2,
};

void main() {
  someMap["c"] = 3;
  print(someMap); // Output: {a: 1, b: 2, c: 3}
}
```

Using the "late" keyword tells Dart that the variable will be initialized at a later time, allowing you to declare it at the top level without an initial value.
