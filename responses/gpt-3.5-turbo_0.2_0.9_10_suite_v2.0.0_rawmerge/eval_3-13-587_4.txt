This error occurs because Jacoco 0.8.6 is not compatible with Java 9 and above. Gradle 7.0.x requires Java 9 or above, so the error occurs when running the test coverage report task.

To fix this issue, you can upgrade Jacoco to version 0.8.7 or above, which is compatible with Java 9 and above. You can update the Jacoco version in your build.gradle file like this:

```
jacoco {
    toolVersion = "0.8.7"
}
```

After updating the Jacoco version, run the test coverage report task again and it should work without any errors.
