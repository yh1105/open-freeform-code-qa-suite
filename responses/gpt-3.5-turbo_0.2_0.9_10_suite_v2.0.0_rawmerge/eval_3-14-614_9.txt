There are a few things you can try to get the preview canvas to show up in Xcode 11 beta:

1. Make sure you have the latest version of Xcode 11 beta installed.
2. Check that you are in the correct canvas mode. You can switch between code and canvas mode by clicking the appropriate button in the top-right corner of the editor.
3. Try cleaning your project and rebuilding it. Sometimes Xcode can get stuck and needs a fresh start.
4. If none of the above solutions work, try resetting Xcode preferences by running the following command in Terminal: `defaults delete com.apple.dt.Xcode`. This will reset Xcode to its default settings and may fix the issue.

If none of these solutions work, you may want to file a bug report with Apple.
