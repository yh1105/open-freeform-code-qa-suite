Here's the bash script to install Python 3.6.5 using brew:

```
#!/bin/bash
brew install python@3.6
```

Save this script to a file with a `.sh` extension (e.g. `install_python.sh`), make it executable with `chmod +x install_python.sh`, and then run it with `./install_python.sh`. This will install Python 3.6.5 using brew.
