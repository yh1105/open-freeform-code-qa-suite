You can use the `groupby` method to group the DataFrame by column A, and then use the `idxmin` method to get the index of the minimum value in column B for each group. Finally, you can use the `loc` method to select the rows with those indices.

Here's the code for the `getMin` function:

```python
def getMin(df):
    idx = df.groupby(['A'])['B'].idxmin()
    result = df.loc[idx]
    return result
```

This function first groups the DataFrame by column A using the `groupby` method, and then applies the `idxmin` method to column B to get the index of the minimum value for each group. The resulting `idx` variable is a Pandas Series object with the group names as the index and the index of the minimum value as the value.

The function then uses the `loc` method to select the rows with those indices from the original DataFrame, and returns the resulting DataFrame as the result.
