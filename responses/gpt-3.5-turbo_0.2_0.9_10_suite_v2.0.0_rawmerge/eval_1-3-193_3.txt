This error message indicates that the Firefox browser binary location is not set or not found in the default location. You can try the following solutions:

1. Make sure that Firefox is installed on your system and its binary location is added to the PATH environment variable.

2. Specify the path to the Firefox binary location explicitly in your code. For example:

```python
from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.firefox.firefox_binary import FirefoxBinary

binary = FirefoxBinary('/path/to/firefox/binary')
browser = webdriver.Firefox(firefox_binary=binary)
browser.get('http://www.seleniumhq.org')
```

Replace `/path/to/firefox/binary` with the actual path to the Firefox binary location on your system.

3. If you are using a virtual environment, make sure that the Firefox binary location is accessible from within the virtual environment. You may need to activate the virtual environment before running the code.

4. If none of the above solutions work, try updating your Selenium and Firefox versions to the latest ones.
