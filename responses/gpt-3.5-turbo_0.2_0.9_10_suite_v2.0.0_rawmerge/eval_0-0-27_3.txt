It seems that you are trying to fetch data from a GraphQL API that is not available. The `uri` you are using in your `ApolloClient` configuration is `https://48p1r2roz4.sse.codesandbox.io`, which is a demo API provided by Apollo Client. It may not be available at all times.

You should replace the `uri` with the actual GraphQL API endpoint that you want to fetch data from. You can check with the API provider for the correct endpoint.

If you are still having issues after updating the `uri`, you can try adding the `fetchPolicy` option to your `useQuery` hook. For example, you can set it to `network-only` to always fetch data from the network and not use the cache:

```javascript
const { loading, error, data } = useQuery(EXCHANGE_RATES, {
  fetchPolicy: 'network-only',
});
```

This may help if you are having issues with cached data.
