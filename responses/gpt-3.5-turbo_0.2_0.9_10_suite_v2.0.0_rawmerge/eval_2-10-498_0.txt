In Rust, the caret operator (`^`) is not used for exponentiation. Instead, you can use the `pow` method provided by the `num_traits` crate. Here's an example:

```rust
use num_traits::pow;

fn main() {
    let base = 2;
    let exponent = 3;
    let result = pow(base, exponent);
    println!("{} raised to the power of {} is {}", base, exponent, result);
}
```

This will output:

```
2 raised to the power of 3 is 8
```

Note that the `pow` method takes two arguments: the base and the exponent. It returns the result of raising the base to the power of the exponent.
