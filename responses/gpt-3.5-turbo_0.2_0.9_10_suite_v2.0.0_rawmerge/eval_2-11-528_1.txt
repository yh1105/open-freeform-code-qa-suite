You can disable the automatic ordering of includes in clang-format by adding the following line to your `.clang-format` file:

```
SortIncludes: false
```

This will disable the sorting of includes and preserve the order in which they appear in your code. 

If you don't have a `.clang-format` file yet, you can create one in the root directory of your project and add the above line to it. 

Note that disabling the sorting of includes may lead to issues with some third-party libraries that require a specific include order. In this case, you may need to manually reorder your includes to match the required order.
