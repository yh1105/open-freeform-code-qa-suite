The error message `HTTP Error 410: Gone` indicates that the video you are trying to download is no longer available on YouTube. This could be due to various reasons such as the video being removed by the uploader or YouTube, or the video being age-restricted or region-restricted.

You can try with a different video URL to see if the issue persists. If the issue persists, you can try using a VPN to change your location and access the video. If none of these solutions work, it is likely that the video is no longer available on YouTube.
