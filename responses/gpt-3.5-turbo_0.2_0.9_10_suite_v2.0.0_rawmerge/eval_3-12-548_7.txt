To disable the back button in Flutter when the user has reached the login page after logging out, you can use the `WillPopScope` widget. Wrap your login page with `WillPopScope` and set its `onWillPop` property to return `false`. This will prevent the user from going back to the previous page using the back button or any other means.

Here's an example:

```
WillPopScope(
  onWillPop: () async => false,
  child: LoginPage(),
)
```

Note that this will only disable the back button on Android devices. On iOS devices, the back button will still be visible but it will not have any effect.
