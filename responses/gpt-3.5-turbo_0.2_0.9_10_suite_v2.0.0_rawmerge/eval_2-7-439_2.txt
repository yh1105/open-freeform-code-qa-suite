The `ext-zip` package is not a regular package that can be installed via Composer. It is an extension that needs to be installed on your system separately. 

To install the `ext-zip` extension, you need to follow these steps:

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Run the following command to install the `zip` extension:
   - For Ubuntu/Debian: `sudo apt-get install php-zip`
   - For CentOS/Fedora: `sudo yum install php-zip`
   - For macOS: `brew install php-zip`
3. Restart your web server to apply the changes.

After installing the `zip` extension, you can try running the `composer require ext-zip` command again. It should work without any issues.
