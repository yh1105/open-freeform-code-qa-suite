Your approach is correct. You can use the `lastIndexOf` method to find the position of the last occurrence of "-354" in the string and then use the `Substring` method to extract the part of the string before that position.

Here's the corrected code:

```
$FileArray = @("Name1-354-03.pdf", "Name23-354-H11.pdf", "Name354-354-02.pdf", "Name3545-354.pdf")
ForEach ($n in $FileArray){
     Write-Host $n.Substring(0, $n.lastIndexOf('-354'))
}
```

This should give you the desired output:

```
Name1-354
Name23-354
Name354-354
Name3545-354
```
