When you run the container with `docker run IMAGE_NAME`, it does not execute the `~/.bashrc` file because it is not an interactive shell. To source the `~/.bashrc` file, you can modify your `launch.sh` script to source it explicitly before running the `npm` and `node` commands. You can add the following line at the beginning of your `launch.sh` script:

```
source /root/.bashrc
```

This will ensure that the `~/.bashrc` file is sourced before running the `npm` and `node` commands.
