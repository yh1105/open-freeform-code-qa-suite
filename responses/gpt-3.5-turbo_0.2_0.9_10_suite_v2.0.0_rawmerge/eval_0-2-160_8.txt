When you set `"sourceMap": false` in your `tsconfig.json` file, it means that the TypeScript compiler will not generate source map files for your TypeScript code. 

Source maps are files that map the compiled JavaScript code back to the original TypeScript code. They are useful for debugging purposes, as they allow you to see the original TypeScript code in the browser's developer tools, even though the code that is actually running is the compiled JavaScript code.

If you set `"sourceMap": false`, the browser's developer tools will not be able to show you the original TypeScript code, and you will only see the compiled JavaScript code. This can make debugging more difficult, especially if you are working with a large codebase.

However, setting `"sourceMap": false` can also have some benefits. It can reduce the size of your compiled JavaScript files, as the source map files can be quite large. This can improve the performance of your application, especially on slower networks.

Overall, whether or not to use source maps is a trade-off between debugging convenience and performance. If you are just starting out with Angular, it is recommended to keep `"sourceMap": true` until you are comfortable with the debugging process.
