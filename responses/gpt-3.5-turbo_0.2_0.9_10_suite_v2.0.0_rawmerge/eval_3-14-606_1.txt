To enable Developer Mode on iOS 16.0, follow these steps:

1. Open the Settings app on your iOS device.
2. Scroll down and tap on "Developer".
3. Toggle on the switch next to "Developer Mode".
4. You may be prompted to enter your device passcode or Apple ID password to confirm the action.
5. Once enabled, you should be able to run the provisioned testing build without any issues.

Note: If you do not see the "Developer" option in your Settings app, it may be hidden. To unhide it, go to "Settings" > "General" > "About" and tap on the "Name" field at the top. This will bring up a prompt to rename your device, and once you have done so, the "Developer" option should appear in the Settings app.
