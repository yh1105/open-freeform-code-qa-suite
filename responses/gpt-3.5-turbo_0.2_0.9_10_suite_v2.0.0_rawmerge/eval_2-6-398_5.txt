You need to register the ILogger service in the ServiceCollection. You can do this by adding the following line to your Main method:
```c#
var services = new ServiceCollection()
    .AddLogging(logging => logging.AddConsole())
    .AddTransient<MyClass>() // Add this line
    .BuildServiceProvider();
```
This will register the MyClass with the ServiceCollection and allow the ILogger to be injected into it.
