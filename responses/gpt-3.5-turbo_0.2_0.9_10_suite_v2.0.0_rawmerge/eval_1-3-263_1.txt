The "f" in `print(f"...")` stands for "formatted string literals" or "f-strings" for short. It is a feature introduced in Python 3.6 that allows you to embed expressions inside string literals, using curly braces `{}`. 

In the example you provided, the curly braces `{}` are used to insert the values of `args.input_directory` and `args.output_directory` into the string. The `f` before the string literal indicates that it is a formatted string, and the expressions inside the curly braces are evaluated at runtime and inserted into the string.

For example, if `args.input_directory` is `"input"` and `args.output_directory` is `"output"`, the output of the two `print` statements would be:

```
Input directory: input
Output directory: output
```
