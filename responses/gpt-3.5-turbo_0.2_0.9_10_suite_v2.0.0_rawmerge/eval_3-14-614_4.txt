There are a few things you can try to get the preview canvas to show up in Xcode 11 beta:

1. Make sure you have the latest version of Xcode 11 beta installed.
2. Check that you have selected the Preview canvas by clicking on the "Resume" button in the top left corner of the Xcode window.
3. Try cleaning the build folder by going to "Product" -> "Clean Build Folder" in the Xcode menu.
4. If you are using a simulator, make sure it is running and that you have selected it in the Xcode toolbar.
5. If none of the above work, try restarting Xcode or your computer.

If none of these solutions work, please provide more information about your setup and any error messages you are seeing.
