The error message "Failed to clear cache. Make sure you have the appropriate permissions." indicates that the user running the command does not have the necessary permissions to clear the cache. 

To fix this, you can try running the command with elevated privileges by using `sudo`:

```
sudo php artisan cache:clear
```

This should allow you to clear the cache successfully. However, be careful when using `sudo` as it grants elevated privileges and can potentially cause damage to your system if used incorrectly.
