You need to add two things to your `~/.zshenv`. First, add the rbenv initialization itself by running `echo 'eval "$(rbenv init -)"' >> ~/.zshenv`. Second, add the ruby path by running `echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.rbenv/shims:${PATH}"' >> ~/.zshenv`. 

You might also run the command `rbenv doctor` to check your installation.
