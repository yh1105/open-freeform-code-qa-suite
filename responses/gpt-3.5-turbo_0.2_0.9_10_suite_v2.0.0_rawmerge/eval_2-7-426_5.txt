The "CSRF token mismatch" error occurs when the CSRF token generated by the server does not match the one sent by the client. This can happen due to a variety of reasons, including session issues.

Since you have already checked that the CSRF token is being generated and included in the header, it is possible that the issue is with the session configuration on the host domain.

Here are some things you can check:

1. Make sure that the session driver on the host domain is set to the same as the one on your local environment. If you are using the file driver locally, make sure that it is also set to file on the host domain.

2. Check the session cookie settings on the host domain. Make sure that the session cookie domain and path are set correctly. If they are not set correctly, the session cookie may not be sent with the request, resulting in a new session being created for each request.

3. Check if there are any caching mechanisms in place on the host domain that may be interfering with the session data. If there are, you may need to configure them to exclude the session data.

4. Check if there are any security settings on the host domain that may be blocking the session data from being stored or retrieved. If there are, you may need to adjust the settings to allow the session data to be stored and retrieved.

5. Check if there are any load balancers or reverse proxies in place on the host domain that may be causing issues with the session data. If there are, you may need to configure them to handle the session data correctly.

I hope this helps you resolve the issue.
