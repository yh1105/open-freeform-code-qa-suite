It seems like ESLint is unable to find your `tsconfig.json` file. You can try the following steps to resolve the issue:

1. Make sure that the `tsconfig.json` file is located in the root directory of your project.

2. In your `.eslintrc.js` file, update the `parserOptions` property to include the `tsconfigRootDir` property and set it to the root directory of your project:

```javascript
parserOptions: {
  project: "./tsconfig.json",
  tsconfigRootDir: __dirname,
  sourceType: "module",
},
```

3. If the above step doesn't work, you can try specifying the path to your `tsconfig.json` file relative to your `.eslintrc.js` file:

```javascript
parserOptions: {
  project: "./path/to/tsconfig.json",
  sourceType: "module",
},
```

4. If none of the above steps work, you can try installing the `@typescript-eslint/parser` package as a dev dependency and update your `.eslintrc.js` file to use it as the parser:

```javascript
parser: "@typescript-eslint/parser",
parserOptions: {
  project: "./tsconfig.json",
  sourceType: "module",
},
```

After making any changes to your `.eslintrc.js` file, make sure to restart VSCode for the changes to take effect.
