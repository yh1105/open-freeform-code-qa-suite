This issue is caused by the incompatibility between Jacoco 0.8.6 and Kotlin 1.5.10. To fix this issue, you can try upgrading Jacoco to version 0.8.7 or higher. 

To upgrade Jacoco, you can modify your build.gradle file as follows:
```
kotlin_version = "1.5.10"
...
jacoco {
    toolVersion = "0.8.7"
}
...
distributionUrl=https\://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-7.0.2-all.zip
```

After modifying the build.gradle file, run the following command to clean and rebuild your project:
```
./gradlew clean build
```

This should fix the issue and allow you to generate the test coverage report successfully.
