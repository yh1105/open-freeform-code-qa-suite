This error message indicates that the integrity check of the package installation failed. Here are some possible measures to resolve the issue:

1. Clear the npm cache by running `npm cache clean --force` and then try running `npm install` again.

2. Delete the `node_modules` folder and `package-lock.json` file and then run `npm install` again.

3. Update your npm version to the latest version by running `npm install -g npm`.

4. If you are using a private registry, check if the registry is up to date and try running `npm install` again.

5. If none of the above solutions work, try deleting the `node_modules` folder and `package-lock.json` file, then run `npm cache clean --force`, and finally run `npm install --no-package-lock`. This will install the packages without using the package-lock.json file.

If none of these solutions work, you may need to investigate further or seek help from the npm community.
