This error occurs because IntelliJ IDEA is using an older version of Maven (3.6.3) than the one used by the Spring Boot project (3.8.5). To fix this issue, you can follow these steps:

1. Open the Maven settings in IntelliJ IDEA by going to File > Settings > Build, Execution, Deployment > Build Tools > Maven.
2. Click on the "Maven home directory" field and select the directory where Maven 3.8.5 is installed.
3. Click "OK" to save the settings.
4. Re-import the Maven project by going to File > New > Project from Existing Sources and selecting the pom.xml file of your Spring Boot project.

This should resolve the issue and allow you to work with your Spring Boot project in IntelliJ IDEA.
