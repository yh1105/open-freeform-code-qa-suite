The error message you are getting indicates that the username and password you are using to authenticate with Gmail are not being accepted. Here are a few things you can try to fix this issue:

1. Make sure that you have enabled "Less secure app access" in your Gmail account settings. You can do this by going to your Google Account settings, clicking on "Security" in the left-hand menu, and then scrolling down to "Less secure app access". Make sure that this option is turned on.

2. Double-check that you are using the correct username and password for your Gmail account. Make sure that there are no typos or mistakes in either field.

3. If you are using two-factor authentication for your Gmail account, you will need to generate an app-specific password to use with nodemailer. You can do this by going to your Google Account settings, clicking on "Security" in the left-hand menu, and then scrolling down to "App passwords". Generate a new app-specific password for nodemailer and use that instead of your regular Gmail password.

4. If none of the above solutions work, you may need to enable "Display Unlock Captcha" in your Gmail account settings. This will allow nodemailer to access your account even if it is not able to authenticate using your regular username and password. To enable this option, go to your Google Account settings, click on "Security" in the left-hand menu, and then scroll down to "Display Unlock Captcha". Click on the "Continue" button and follow the instructions to enable this option.

I hope one of these solutions helps you resolve the issue.
