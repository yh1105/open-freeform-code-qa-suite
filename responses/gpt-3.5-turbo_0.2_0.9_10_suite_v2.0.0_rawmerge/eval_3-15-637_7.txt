The issue you are facing could be due to the incompatibility of the Selenium WebDriver version with the Excel 2019 version. Here are a few suggestions that you can try:

1. Make sure that you have the latest version of the Selenium WebDriver installed. You can download it from the official Selenium website.

2. Check if the reference to the Selenium WebDriver is properly set in the VBA editor. To do this, go to Tools > References and make sure that the reference to the Selenium Type Library is checked.

3. Try using a different browser driver. For example, if you are using the Internet Explorer driver, try using the Chrome or Firefox driver instead.

4. Try running the code in compatibility mode. To do this, right-click on the Excel icon and select Properties > Compatibility. Check the box that says "Run this program in compatibility mode for" and select the version of Excel that was previously working.

5. If none of the above solutions work, try uninstalling and reinstalling Excel 2019 and the Selenium WebDriver.

I hope one of these solutions helps you resolve the issue.
