The reason why you are seeing the logs in that order is because the `onItemSelected` function is called asynchronously when the user selects an item in the spinner. This means that the `return` statement is executed before the `onItemSelected` function is called, so the value of `itemSelected` is still an empty string.

To fix this, you can use a callback function to return the selected item instead of returning it directly from the `setupListWithAdapter` function. Here's an example:

```
fun Spinner.setupListWithAdapter(list: MutableList<String>, callback: (String) -> Unit) {
    val adapter = ArrayAdapter(context, android.R.layout.simple_spinner_item, list)
    adapter.setDropDownViewResource(android.R.layout.simple_spinner_dropdown_item)
    this.adapter = adapter
    this.onItemSelectedListener = object : AdapterView.OnItemSelectedListener {
        override fun onItemSelected(p0: AdapterView<*>?, p1: View?, p2: Int, p3: Long) {
            val itemSelected = list[p2]
            callback(itemSelected)
        }
        override fun onNothingSelected(p0: AdapterView<*>?) {
        }
    }
}
```

In this version of the function, we pass a callback function as a parameter. This function takes a `String` parameter (the selected item) and returns nothing (`Unit`). When an item is selected in the spinner, we call the callback function with the selected item as the argument.

To use this function, you can pass a lambda expression as the callback parameter:

```
spinner.setupListWithAdapter(list) { selectedItem ->
    // Do something with the selected item
}
```

In this example, `selectedItem` is the selected item from the spinner, and you can use it to perform any necessary actions.
