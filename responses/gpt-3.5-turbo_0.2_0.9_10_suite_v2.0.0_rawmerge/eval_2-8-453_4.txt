The err113 warning in golangci-lint is suggesting that you should not define dynamic errors using `errors.New()` directly in your code. Instead, you should use wrapped static errors.

Wrapped static errors are errors that are defined once and reused throughout the codebase. They are usually defined as package-level variables and can be wrapped with additional context information as needed.

Here's an example of how you can define a wrapped static error:

```
var ErrRepo = errors.New("repo error")

// ...

func foo() error {
    // ...
    return fmt.Errorf("failed to do something: %w", ErrRepo)
}
```

In this example, `ErrRepo` is a wrapped static error that can be reused throughout the codebase. When returning an error, you can wrap it with additional context information using `fmt.Errorf()` and `%w` verb to include the wrapped error.

To fix the err113 warnings in your code, you can define wrapped static errors for the dynamic errors that you are currently defining using `errors.New()`. Then, use the wrapped static errors instead of defining new errors each time.

For example:

```
var ErrRepoGaveErr = errors.New("repo gave err")
var ErrOops = errors.New("oops")

// ...

repoMock.EXPECT().Save(gomock.Eq(&foooBarBar)).Return(nil, ErrRepoGaveErr)
repoMock.EXPECT().FindAll().Return(nil, ErrOops)
```

By using wrapped static errors, you can ensure that your error messages are consistent and reusable throughout your codebase.
