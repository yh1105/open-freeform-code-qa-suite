Starting from macOS Catalina 10.15, the default shell for new user accounts is zsh instead of bash. Therefore, if you have upgraded to Catalina, your shell might be zsh instead of bash.

To set environment variables in zsh, you need to add them to `~/.zshrc` instead of `~/.bash_profile` or `~/.profile`.

To set the `JBOSS_HOME` environment variable in zsh, you can add the following line to your `~/.zshrc` file:

```
export JBOSS_HOME=/Users/{USERNAME}/Desktop/jboss7
```

After adding this line, save the file and run the following command to apply the changes:

```
source ~/.zshrc
```

Now, you should be able to access the `JBOSS_HOME` environment variable by running `echo $JBOSS_HOME` in your terminal.
