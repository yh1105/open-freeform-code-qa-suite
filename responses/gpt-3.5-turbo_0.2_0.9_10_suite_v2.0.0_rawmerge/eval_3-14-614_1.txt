There are a few things that could be causing the preview to not show up in Xcode 11 beta. Here are a few things you can try:

1. Make sure you are running Xcode 11 beta on macOS Catalina beta. The preview canvas requires the latest version of macOS to work properly.

2. Check that you have the latest version of Xcode 11 beta installed. You can check for updates in the App Store.

3. Try cleaning your project and rebuilding it. Sometimes Xcode can get stuck and needs a fresh start.

4. Make sure you have the canvas open by clicking the "Canvas" button in the top right corner of the Xcode window.

5. Check that you have selected the correct device and orientation for the preview canvas. You can do this by clicking the device and orientation dropdown menus in the top left corner of the canvas.

6. If none of the above solutions work, try restarting Xcode or your computer.

Hopefully one of these solutions will help you get the preview canvas working in Xcode 11 beta.
