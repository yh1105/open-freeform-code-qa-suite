2. Clean and rebuild your project to ensure that the changes take effect.

Regarding adding email and cardholder name in Stripe, you can use the `com.stripe.android.model.Card` class to create a card object with the required information and then use the `com.stripe.android.Stripe` class to create a payment method with the card object. Here's an example:

```kotlin
val card = Card.create(
    "4242424242424242",
    12,
    2022,
    "123"
)
card.email = "test@example.com"
card.name = "John Doe"

val stripe = Stripe(context, "pk_test_...")
stripe.createPaymentMethod(
    PaymentMethodCreateParams.create(
        card.toPaymentMethodParamsCard(),
        PaymentMethod.BillingDetails.Builder()
            .setEmail(card.email)
            .setName(card.name)
            .build()
    ),
    callback
)
```

Note that you need to replace `"pk_test_..."` with your actual publishable key. Also, make sure to handle the callback appropriately.
