The error message indicates that your app is not using AndroidX, which is a major change in the Android ecosystem that happened in 2018. AndroidX replaces the original support library and provides backward compatibility while also adding new features. 

To fix this issue, you need to migrate your app to AndroidX. You can do this by following the steps provided in the error message or by using the Android Studio Refactor tool. Here are the steps to migrate your app to AndroidX using Android Studio:

1. Open your project in Android Studio.
2. Click on "Refactor" in the top menu and select "Migrate to AndroidX".
3. A dialog box will appear, click on "Migrate" to start the migration process.
4. Wait for the migration process to complete. Android Studio will automatically update your project files to use AndroidX.
5. Once the migration is complete, rebuild your project using the command "flutter build appbundle" or "flutter build apk".

After migrating to AndroidX, you should be able to generate the Android project study and its APK without any issues.
