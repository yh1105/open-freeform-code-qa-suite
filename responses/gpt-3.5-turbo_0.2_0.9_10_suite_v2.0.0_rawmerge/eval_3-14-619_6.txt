The issue might be that you are using a `@Binding` property in a `PreviewProvider`. Try changing `@State` to `@Binding` in `ContentView_Previews` and pass a `Bool` value to `selected` in the preview. For example:

```
struct ContentView_Previews: PreviewProvider {
    static var previews: some View {
        ContentView(isSelected: .constant(true))
    }
}
``` 

This should update the view when the button is clicked.
