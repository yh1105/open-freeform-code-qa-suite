You can try the following steps to install the latest version of CMake on your Linux environment:

1. Remove the current version of CMake using the following command:

   ```
   sudo apt-get remove cmake
   ```

2. Download the latest version of CMake from the official website using the following command:

   ```
   wget https://cmake.org/files/v3.21/cmake-3.21.3-linux-x86_64.tar.gz
   ```

   Note: You can check for the latest version on the official website and replace the version number in the above command accordingly.

3. Extract the downloaded file using the following command:

   ```
   tar -xzvf cmake-3.21.3-linux-x86_64.tar.gz
   ```

4. Move the extracted folder to the /opt directory using the following command:

   ```
   sudo mv cmake-3.21.3-linux-x86_64 /opt/cmake-3.21.3
   ```

5. Create a symbolic link for the new version of CMake using the following command:

   ```
   sudo ln -s /opt/cmake-3.21.3/bin/cmake /usr/local/bin/cmake
   ```

6. Verify the installation by checking the version of CMake using the following command:

   ```
   cmake --version
   ```

   This should display the latest version of CMake that you have installed.

Note: The above steps assume that you are using a 64-bit Linux environment. If you are using a different architecture, you will need to download the appropriate version of CMake from the official website.
