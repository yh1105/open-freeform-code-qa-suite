It seems that the issue is related to the network connection. The URI provided in the code is not working properly. 

You can try changing the URI to a working GraphQL API endpoint. For example, you can use the following URI:

```
https://48p1r2roz4.sse.codesandbox.io/graphql
```

Also, make sure that your device or emulator is connected to the internet. 

If the issue persists, you can try adding the `fetchPolicy` option to your `useQuery` hook. For example, you can set it to `network-only` to force the query to always fetch data from the server:

```javascript
const { loading, error, data } = useQuery(EXCHANGE_RATES, {
  fetchPolicy: 'network-only',
});
```

I hope this helps!
