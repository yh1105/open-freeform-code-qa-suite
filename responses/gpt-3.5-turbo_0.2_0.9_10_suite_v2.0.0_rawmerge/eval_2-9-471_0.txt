To import images in a React component with TypeScript and Parcel, you need to do the following:

1. Create a `.d.ts` file with the same name as the image file you want to import. For example, if your image is named `image.jpg`, create a file named `image.d.ts`. Inside this file, add the following code:

```typescript
declare module '*.jpg' {
  const value: any;
  export default value;
}
```

This tells TypeScript that any file with a `.jpg` extension can be imported as a module.

2. Move the `.d.ts` file to the same directory as the image file. In your case, move `image.d.ts` to the `assets` directory.

3. In your component file, import the image like this:

```typescript
import * as React from 'react';
import image from '../assets/image.jpg';

const Box = props => {
  // do things...
}

export default Box;
```

Note that you don't need to specify the file extension when importing the image. Also, you should use the `default` export instead of `*`.

4. Finally, make sure that the `assets` directory is included in Parcel's asset pipeline. You can do this by adding the following line to your `package.json` file:

```json
{
  "parcel": {
    "includeFiles": [
      "src/assets/**/*"
    ]
  }
}
```

This tells Parcel to include all files in the `assets` directory and its subdirectories in the asset pipeline.

If you still get the error `Cannot find module`, try restarting your development server. If that doesn't work, make sure that your `tsconfig.json` file includes the following line:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "esModuleInterop": true
  }
}
```

This enables interoperability between CommonJS and ES6 modules, which can sometimes cause issues when importing modules.
