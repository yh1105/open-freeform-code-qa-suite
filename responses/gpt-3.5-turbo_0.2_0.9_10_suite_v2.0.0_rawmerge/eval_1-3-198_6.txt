To read a CSV file from Google Drive, you need to modify the URL as follows:

1. Replace "file/d/" with "uc?id="
2. Replace "/view?usp=sharing" with "&export=download"

Here's the modified code:

```python
import pandas as pd

def processURL(url):
    file_id = url.split('/')[-2]
    dwn_url = "https://drive.google.com/uc?id=" + file_id
    return pd.read_csv(dwn_url)
```

This function takes the Google Drive URL as input, extracts the file ID from the URL, modifies the URL as described above, and then reads the CSV file using `pd.read_csv()`. 

You can call this function with your original URL as follows:

```python
url = 'https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B6GhBwm5vaB2ekdlZW5WZnppb28/view?usp=sharing'
df = processURL(url)
``` 

This should return a pandas DataFrame with the contents of the CSV file.
