It seems like you are trying to fetch data from a GraphQL API endpoint that is not available. The `uri` provided in your `ApolloClient` configuration is for a demo endpoint that may not be available all the time.

You can try changing the `uri` to a different GraphQL API endpoint that is available and has the schema that matches your query.

For example, you can try using the following `uri`:

```
uri: 'https://countries.trevorblades.com/graphql'
```

This endpoint has a public GraphQL API with a simple schema that you can use to test your query.

If you still face issues, you can try adding the `networkError` property to your `useQuery` hook to see if there are any network errors:

```javascript
const { loading, error, data, networkError } = useQuery(EXCHANGE_RATES);

console.log(loading, error, data, networkError);
```

This will log any network errors that occur during the query.
