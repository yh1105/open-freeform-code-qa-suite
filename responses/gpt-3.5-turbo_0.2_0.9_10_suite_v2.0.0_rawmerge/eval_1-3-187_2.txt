You can use the following function to replace the elements in `b` with the elements in `rest` and then replace the corresponding elements in `last` with the updated `b` list:

```python
def ReplaceElementsByIndex(rest, b, last):
    b[:len(rest)] = rest
    for i in range(len(last)):
        if last[i] in b:
            last[i] = b[b.index(last[i])]
    return last
```

Here's how it works:

1. The first line of the function replaces the first `len(rest)` elements in `b` with the elements in `rest`.
2. The `for` loop iterates over each element in `last`.
3. For each element in `last`, the `if` statement checks if it is in `b`.
4. If the element is in `b`, the corresponding element in `last` is replaced with the element in `b`.
5. The updated `last` list is returned.

You can call this function with your example lists like this:

```python
rest=[5, 7, 11, 4]
b=[21, 22, 33, 31, 23, 15, 19, 13, 6]
last=[33, 19, 40, 21, 31, 22, 6, 15, 13, 23]

result = ReplaceElementsByIndex(rest, b, last)
print(result)
```

Output:
```
[11, 19, 40, 5, 4, 7, 6, 15, 13, 23]
```
