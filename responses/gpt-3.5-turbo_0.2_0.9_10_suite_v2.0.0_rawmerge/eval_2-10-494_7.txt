This error is caused by a bug in rust-analyzer, which is a language server for Rust. It is a false positive and does not indicate any actual issues with your code. 

You can try updating rust-analyzer to the latest version, as this bug may have been fixed in a newer release. Alternatively, you can ignore the error for now and continue working on your code. 

If you want to suppress the error message in your editor, you can add the following comment above the `use` statement:
```rust
// rust-analyzer incorrectly reports an error here
``` 
This will tell rust-analyzer to ignore the error in this specific location.
