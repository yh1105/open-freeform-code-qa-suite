This error is caused by a bug in rust-analyzer, which is a language server for Rust that provides IDE-like features such as code completion and error highlighting. The error message is indicating that rust-analyzer is unable to resolve the `format_args` macro, which is used internally by the `pad_str` function.

This error is a false positive and does not indicate any actual issues with your code. You can safely ignore it, or you can try updating rust-analyzer to the latest version to see if the issue has been fixed.
