Starting from macOS Catalina 10.15, the default shell for new user accounts is now zsh instead of bash. Therefore, if you are using the default shell, you should add your environment variables to `~/.zshrc` instead of `~/.bash_profile` or `~/.profile`.

To set the `JBOSS_HOME` environment variable in zsh, you can add the following line to your `~/.zshrc` file:

```
export JBOSS_HOME=/Users/{USERNAME}/Desktop/jboss7
```

After adding the line, save the file and run the following command to apply the changes:

```
source ~/.zshrc
```

Now, you should be able to access the `JBOSS_HOME` environment variable by running `echo $JBOSS_HOME` in your terminal.
