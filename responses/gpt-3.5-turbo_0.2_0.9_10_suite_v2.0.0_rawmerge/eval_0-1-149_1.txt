You can use the `group-hover` variant in Tailwind to apply styles to an element when its parent is being hovered over. Here's an example of how you can achieve the animation effect you want:

```html
<a href="#" class="group relative text-sky-600">
  Link
  <span class="absolute inset-x-0 bottom-0 h-0.5 bg-sky-600 transform origin-bottom-left scale-x-0 group-hover:scale-x-100 transition duration-500"></span>
</a>
```

In this code, we're using the `group` class to apply styles to both the link and its child element. We're also using the `relative` class on the link to make the child element position itself relative to the link.

The child element is an absolutely positioned `span` element that spans the full width of the link and has a height of `0.5rem`. We're using the `transform` property to scale the element horizontally from `0` to `100%` when the link is being hovered over. We're also using the `transition` property to animate the scaling effect over a duration of `500ms`.

Note that we're not using the `:after` pseudo-element in this code. Instead, we're using a separate `span` element to achieve the animation effect.
