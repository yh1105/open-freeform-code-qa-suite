The warning occurs because the value of `myMap[1]` is nullable (`String?`) and cannot be assigned to a non-nullable variable (`String`). To solve the warning, you can either change the type of the variable to nullable (`String?`) or use the null-aware operator (`?`) to check for null before assigning the value. Here are two ways to solve the warning:

1. Change the type of the variable to nullable (`String?`):
```dart
void foo(Map<int, String> myMap) {
  if (myMap.containsKey(1)) {
    String? s = myMap[1];
  }
}
```

2. Use the null-aware operator (`?`) to check for null before assigning the value:
```dart
void foo(Map<int, String> myMap) {
  if (myMap.containsKey(1)) {
    String s = myMap[1]!;
  }
}
```
In this case, we are using the null-aware operator (`!`) to tell Dart that we are sure that the value is not null and can be safely assigned to a non-nullable variable.
