With Font Awesome 5, the syntax for using icons has changed. You need to use the `font-family: "Font Awesome 5 Free"` or `font-family: "Font Awesome 5 Pro"` depending on the version you are using. Also, the icon codes have changed from `\fXXX` to `\fXXX` or `\uXXXX`. Here's the updated code:

```css
#mainNav .navbar-collapse .navbar-sidenav .nav-link-collapse:after {
  float: right;
  content: "\f107";
  font-family: "Font Awesome 5 Free";
}
```

Note that you need to include the Font Awesome 5 CSS file in your project for this to work.
