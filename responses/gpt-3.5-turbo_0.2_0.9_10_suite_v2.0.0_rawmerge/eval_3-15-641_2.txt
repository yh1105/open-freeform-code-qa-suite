You can try using the following VBA code to get the local path of the OneDrive folder:

```
Sub GetOneDriveLocalPath()
    Dim objShell As Object
    Set objShell = CreateObject("Shell.Application")
    MsgBox objShell.Namespace(13).Self.Path
End Sub
```

This code uses the Windows Shell object to retrieve the local path of the OneDrive folder. The `Namespace(13)` method represents the OneDrive folder, and the `Self.Path` property returns the local path.

Note that this code may not work if the OneDrive folder is not synced to the local computer.
