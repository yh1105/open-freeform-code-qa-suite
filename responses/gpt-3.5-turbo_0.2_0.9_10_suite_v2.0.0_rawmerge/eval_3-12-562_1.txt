You can use the `add` and `subtract` methods of the `DateTime` class in Dart to add or subtract months/years to a date. 

To add/subtract months/years to a `DateTime` object, you can use the `add` or `subtract` method with a `Duration` object that represents the number of months/years you want to add/subtract. For example, to add 3 months to a `DateTime` object `date`, you can use the following code:

```
DateTime newDate = date.add(Duration(months: 3));
```

Similarly, to subtract 2 years from a `DateTime` object `date`, you can use the following code:

```
DateTime newDate = date.subtract(Duration(years: 2));
```

Alternatively, you can use the `DateTime` constructor to define the base time and change the day/month/year properties. For example, to add 2 years to a `DateTime` object `date`, you can use the following code:

```
DateTime newDate = DateTime(date.year + 2, date.month, date.day);
```

Note that this method only changes the year property of the `DateTime` object, and leaves the month and day properties unchanged.
