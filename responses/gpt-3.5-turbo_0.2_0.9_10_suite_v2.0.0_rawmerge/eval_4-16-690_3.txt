Starting from macOS Catalina 10.15, the default shell for new user accounts is now zsh instead of bash. Therefore, if you are using the default shell, you need to add your environment variables to the `~/.zshrc` file instead of `~/.bash_profile` or `~/.profile`.

To set the `JBOSS_HOME` environment variable in zsh, you can add the following line to your `~/.zshrc` file:

```
export JBOSS_HOME=/Users/{USERNAME}/Desktop/jboss7
```

After adding this line, save the file and then run the following command to apply the changes:

```
source ~/.zshrc
```

This will load the updated `~/.zshrc` file and make the `JBOSS_HOME` environment variable available in your terminal session.

You can then check if the environment variable is set correctly by running the following command:

```
echo $JBOSS_HOME
```

This should output the path to your JBoss installation directory.
