This error usually occurs when there is an issue with the build settings or the script used in the build phase. Here are some steps you can try to resolve the issue:

1. Clean the project: Go to Product > Clean Build Folder in Xcode and try building the project again.

2. Check build settings: Make sure that the build settings for the project and target are correct. Check if there are any missing or incorrect settings.

3. Check script: Check the script used in the build phase and make sure it is correct. You can also try removing the script and adding it again.

4. Check dependencies: Check if all the dependencies are installed correctly and up to date. You can try removing and reinstalling the dependencies.

5. Check Xcode version: Make sure you are using the latest version of Xcode. You can try updating Xcode to the latest version and try building the project again.

6. Check for conflicts: Check if there are any conflicts between the dependencies. You can try removing one dependency at a time and see if the error goes away.

7. Check for warnings: Check if there are any warnings in the build log. Sometimes warnings can cause the build to fail.

If none of the above steps work, you can try creating a new project and adding the dependencies one by one to see if the error occurs again.
