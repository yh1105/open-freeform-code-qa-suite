You can specify the path to the Java executable that you want to use by setting the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable. Here's how you can do it:

1. Find the path to the Java executable that you want to use. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:

   ```
   which java
   ```

   This will output the path to the Java executable that is currently being used by your system.

2. Set the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable to the path that you found in step 1. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:

   ```
   export JAVA_HOME=/path/to/java
   ```

   Replace `/path/to/java` with the path that you found in step 1.

3. Run the Maven wrapper command as you normally would. Maven will now use the Java executable that you specified in the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable.

   ```
   ./mvnw clean install
   ```

   Note that you need to run the `export` command in every terminal session where you want to use the Maven wrapper with the specified Java version. If you want to make this change permanent, you can add the `export` command to your shell's startup script (e.g. `~/.bashrc` for Bash).
