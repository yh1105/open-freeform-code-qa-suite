This error is caused by a bug in rust-analyzer, a popular Rust language server. It is a false positive and does not indicate any issues with your code. 

You can try updating your rust-analyzer extension to the latest version, or ignoring the error for now. In the meantime, you can continue to use `cargo run` and `cargo test` without any issues.
