You can use the `conda list --show-channel-urls` command to display the size of each package in your conda environment. 

Here's how to do it:

1. Open the Anaconda Prompt or your terminal.
2. Type `conda list --show-channel-urls` and press Enter.
3. Wait for the command to finish running. This may take a few seconds to a few minutes, depending on the number of packages you have installed.
4. The output will show the package name, version, build number, and size in bytes.

Note that the size shown is the compressed size of the package. When the package is installed, it will take up more space on your disk.
