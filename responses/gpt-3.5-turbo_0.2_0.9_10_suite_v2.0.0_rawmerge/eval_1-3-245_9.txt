It seems like the Dockerfile is unable to find the `app` module. You can try modifying the `COPY` command to include the parent directory of the `app` module. Here's an updated Dockerfile:

```Dockerfile
FROM python:3.8
WORKDIR /app

COPY requirements.txt /
RUN pip install --requirement /requirements.txt

COPY ./fastapi /app

EXPOSE 8000
CMD ["uvicorn", "app.main:app", "--host=0.0.0.0" , "--reload" , "--port", "8000"]
```

In this updated Dockerfile, we are copying the `fastapi` directory instead of the `app` directory. This should include the `app` module as well as any other modules or files in the `fastapi` directory. 

Make sure to rebuild the Docker image after modifying the Dockerfile:

```bash
docker-compose build
```

Then you can start the container using:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
``` 

This should resolve the `ModuleNotFoundError` issue.
