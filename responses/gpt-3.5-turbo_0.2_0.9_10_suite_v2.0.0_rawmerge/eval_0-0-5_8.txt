The error message indicates that Python is not installed on your system or it is not added to the PATH environment variable. Here are the steps to fix this:

1. Download and install Python 2.7.x from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/
2. During the installation process, make sure to select the option to add Python to the PATH environment variable.
3. After the installation is complete, open a new command prompt and run the following command to verify that Python is installed and added to the PATH:

```
python --version
```

4. If the command above returns the version of Python installed, then you can try to rebuild the node-sass module by running the following command in your project directory:

```
npm rebuild node-sass
```

This should rebuild the node-sass module with the correct dependencies and resolve the issue.
