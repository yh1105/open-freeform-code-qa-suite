To transfer native SOL directly into the event account's vault address in an anchor smart contract instruction, you can use the following code:

```
let ix = anchor_lang::solana_program::system_instruction::transfer(
    from_wallet_address,
    &event_account.vault,
    amount,
);
anchor_lang::solana_program::program::invoke(
    &ix,
    &[
        &event_account.vault,
        &spl_token::id(),
    ],
);
```

Replace `from_wallet_address` with the address of the wallet from which you want to transfer SOL, and `amount` with the amount of SOL you want to transfer. 

`event_account` is the account struct for your event account, which should have a `vault` field that contains the address of the event account's vault. 

The `invoke` function takes an instruction and an array of accounts. In this case, we pass the vault address as the first account and the SPL token program ID as the second account.
