This issue is caused by the incompatibility between Jacoco 0.8.6 and Kotlin 1.5.10. You can try upgrading Jacoco to version 0.8.7 or higher, which should be compatible with Kotlin 1.5.10.

To upgrade Jacoco, change the `toolVersion` property in your `build.gradle` file to:

```
jacoco {
    toolVersion = "0.8.7"
}
```

After making this change, run the test coverage report task again and see if the issue is resolved.
