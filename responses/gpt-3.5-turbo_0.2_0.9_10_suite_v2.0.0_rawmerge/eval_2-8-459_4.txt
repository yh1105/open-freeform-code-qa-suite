It seems like the go module system is unable to download the dependency `github.ibm.com/kms/key-protect-client@v0.1.5`. Here are some steps you can take to debug this issue:

1. Check if the dependency is available in the module cache on computer B. You can do this by running the following command:

   ```bash
   go list -m github.ibm.com/kms/key-protect-client@v0.1.5
   ```

   If the dependency is not available in the module cache, then the go module system is unable to download it. You can try to download it manually by running the following command:

   ```bash
   go get github.ibm.com/kms/key-protect-client@v0.1.5
   ```

   If this command fails, then there might be an issue with your credentials or access to the private repo.

2. Check if the dependency is available in the vendor directory. If you have a vendor directory in your project, then the dependency might be available there. You can check this by running the following command:

   ```bash
   ls vendor/github.ibm.com/kms/key-protect-client
   ```

   If the dependency is not available in the vendor directory, then you might need to run `go mod vendor` to download the dependencies and populate the vendor directory.

3. Check if the dependency is available on computer A. If the dependency is available on computer A, then you can try copying the dependency to computer B and see if that resolves the issue.

   You can find the dependency in the module cache on computer A by running the following command:

   ```bash
   go env GOMODCACHE
   ```

   This will give you the path to the module cache. You can then copy the dependency from the cache to computer B and place it in the same location in the module cache.

   Note that this is not a recommended solution, as it can lead to inconsistencies in the module cache and cause issues in the future. It's better to resolve the issue with the go module system so that it can download the dependency correctly.
