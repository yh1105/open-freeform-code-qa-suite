Using `@Autowired` on the constructor is a recommended way of injecting dependencies in Spring. It makes the code more readable and easier to understand the dependencies of a class. It also ensures that all required dependencies are available at the time of object creation. Additionally, it allows for constructor injection, which is considered a better practice than setter injection as it ensures that the object is fully initialized before it is used. However, if you prefer to use setter injection, you can still do so without using `@Autowired`.
