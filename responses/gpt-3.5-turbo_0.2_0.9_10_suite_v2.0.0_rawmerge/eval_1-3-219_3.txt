Here are some steps you can try to solve the issue:

1. Check if the Jupyter package is installed in your virtual environment "da38". You can do this by activating the environment and running the command `conda list`. If Jupyter is not installed, you can install it by running `conda install jupyter`.

2. Check if the IPython kernel is installed in your virtual environment "da38". You can do this by activating the environment and running the command `conda list`. If IPython kernel is not installed, you can install it by running `conda install ipykernel`.

3. Check if the correct Python interpreter is selected in VS Code. You can do this by opening the command palette (Ctrl+Shift+P) and searching for "Python: Select Interpreter". Make sure that the interpreter for your virtual environment "da38" is selected.

4. Try restarting the Jupyter server by opening the command palette (Ctrl+Shift+P) and searching for "Jupyter: Restart Kernel". This will restart the Jupyter server and may solve the issue.

5. If none of the above steps work, try uninstalling and reinstalling the Python extension in VS Code. You can do this by opening the Extensions panel (Ctrl+Shift+X), searching for "Python", and clicking on the uninstall and install buttons.

Hopefully, one of these steps will solve the issue and you will be able to launch Jupyter notebook from within VS Code.
