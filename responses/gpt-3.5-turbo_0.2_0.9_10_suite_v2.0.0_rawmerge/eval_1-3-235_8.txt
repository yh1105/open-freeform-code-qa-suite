The error occurs because some of the values in the "year" column are not integers, but floats with a decimal point. To convert the column to integers, we need to remove the decimal points first.

Here's a modified version of your code that should work:

```python
data_h_df['year'] = data_h_df['year'].astype(str).str.split('.').str[0].astype(int)
```

This code first converts the "year" column to a string, then splits each string on the decimal point, and finally takes the first part (i.e., the integer part) and converts it to an integer.

Here's the complete `transformation` function:

```python
def transformation(data_h_df):
    data_h_df['year'] = data_h_df['year'].astype(str).str.split('.').str[0].astype(int)
    return data_h_df
```

You can call this function with your dataframe as follows:

```python
transformed_df = transformation(data_h_df)
```
