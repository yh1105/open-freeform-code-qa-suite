There are a few things you can try to get the preview canvas to show up in Xcode 11 beta:

1. Make sure you have the latest version of Xcode 11 beta installed.
2. Try cleaning the build folder by going to Product > Clean Build Folder.
3. Restart Xcode and try again.
4. Make sure you are in the Preview canvas by clicking on the "Resume" button in the top left corner of the canvas.
5. Check if there are any errors in the console or in the code that may be preventing the preview from showing up.
6. Try creating a new project and see if the preview canvas works in the new project.

If none of these solutions work, you may want to file a bug report with Apple.
