The error message you are getting indicates that there is an issue with the line endings in the `npm` executable file. This is a common issue when using Windows-based tools in a Linux environment.

To fix this issue, you can try the following steps:

1. Open the `npm` executable file in a text editor that supports Unix-style line endings (e.g. Notepad++, Sublime Text, etc.).
2. Convert the line endings to Unix-style by selecting "Edit" > "EOL Conversion" > "Unix (LF)" in the text editor.
3. Save the file and try running the `npm -v` command again.

If this does not work, you can try reinstalling `npm` using the following command:

```
sudo apt-get install -y npm
```

This should install the latest version of `npm` and set it up correctly.
