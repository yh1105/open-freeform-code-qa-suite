The error message suggests that there is an issue with the encryption of a message in your Rails application. To fix this, you can try resetting your Rails application's secret key base on Heroku by running the following command:
```
heroku config:set SECRET_KEY_BASE=`rails secret`
```
This will generate a new secret key base and set it as an environment variable on your Heroku app.

Regarding the error when pushing to Heroku, it seems like there is an issue with the pre-receive hook. You can try disabling the pre-receive hook by running the following command:
```
git config --global core.hooksPath /dev/null
```
This will temporarily disable the pre-receive hook and allow you to push your code to Heroku. However, it's important to note that the pre-receive hook is there for a reason and disabling it may cause issues in the future. It's recommended to investigate the cause of the pre-receive hook error and fix it properly.
