In AndroidX, you can instantiate a ViewModel using the `ViewModelProvider` class. Here's an example:

```
val viewModel = ViewModelProvider(this).get(MyViewModel::class.java)
```

Make sure you have added the necessary dependencies in your app's build.gradle file:

```
implementation 'androidx.lifecycle:lifecycle-viewmodel-ktx:2.2.0'
implementation 'androidx.lifecycle:lifecycle-livedata-ktx:2.2.0'
``` 

Also, make sure that your ViewModel class extends `ViewModel`.
