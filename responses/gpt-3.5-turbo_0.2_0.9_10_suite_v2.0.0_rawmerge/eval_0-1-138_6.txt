Yes, it is possible to detect if the user's system is in Dark Mode in Safari/Chrome/Firefox using CSS media queries. Here's an example:

```css
@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
  /* styles for dark mode */
}

@media (prefers-color-scheme: light) {
  /* styles for light mode */
}
```

The `prefers-color-scheme` media query allows you to target styles based on the user's preferred color scheme. If the user is in Dark Mode, the `dark` query will be matched, and if they are in Light Mode, the `light` query will be matched.

You can also use JavaScript to detect the user's preferred color scheme and apply styles accordingly. Here's an example using the `matchMedia` method:

```javascript
if (window.matchMedia && window.matchMedia('(prefers-color-scheme: dark)').matches) {
  // user is in dark mode
} else {
  // user is in light mode
}
```

Note that not all browsers support the `prefers-color-scheme` media query, so you may need to use a JavaScript fallback for older browsers.
