This error occurs because pdftk is a 32-bit application and macOS Catalina only supports 64-bit applications. Here are a few solutions you can try:

1. Use an alternative to pdftk: There are several alternatives to pdftk that are compatible with macOS Catalina, such as PDFsam Basic, PDFtk Server, and QPDF.

2. Use a virtual machine: You can install a virtual machine on your Mac and run an older version of macOS that supports 32-bit applications. This will allow you to use pdftk without any issues.

3. Use Homebrew: You can install pdftk using Homebrew, which will install a version of pdftk that is compatible with macOS Catalina. To install pdftk using Homebrew, open Terminal and run the following commands:

```
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
brew install pdftk-java
```

4. Use Docker: You can use Docker to run pdftk in a container. This will allow you to use pdftk without any issues on macOS Catalina. To do this, you will need to install Docker on your Mac and then run the following command in Terminal:

```
docker run --rm -v /path/to/local/directory:/pdf bwits/pdf2htmlex pdftk input.pdf output.pdf
```

Replace `/path/to/local/directory` with the path to the directory where your PDF files are located.
