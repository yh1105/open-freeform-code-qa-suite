The err113 lint rule is suggesting that you should not define dynamic errors using `errors.New()` and instead use wrapped static errors. This is because dynamic errors can make it difficult to identify the root cause of an error and can make error handling more complex.

To fix this, you can use a static error message that describes the error in a more meaningful way. You can use the `fmt.Errorf()` function to create a wrapped static error message that includes the original error message.

For example, instead of:
```
errors.New("repo gave err")
```
you can use:
```
fmt.Errorf("failed to save foobarbar: %w", err)
```
This creates a wrapped static error message that includes the original error message and can help identify the root cause of the error.

Similarly, instead of:
```
errors.New("oops")
```
you can use:
```
fmt.Errorf("failed to find all foobars: %w", err)
```
This creates a wrapped static error message that includes the original error message and can help identify the root cause of the error.

By using wrapped static errors, you can make error handling more consistent and easier to understand.
