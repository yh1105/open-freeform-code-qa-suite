The error message is indicating that you are trying to access a `@State` variable outside of the `body` property of a `View`, which is not allowed in SwiftUI. 

To initialize the value of a `@State` variable based on external data, you can use a separate `init` method that takes the external data as a parameter and sets the value of the `@State` variable accordingly. Here's an example:

```
struct StateFromOutside: View {
    let list = [
        "a": "Letter A",
        "b": "Letter B",
        // ...
    ]
    @State var fullText: String

    init(letter: String) {
        self._fullText = State(initialValue: list[letter]!)
    }

    var body: some View {
        TextField($fullText)
    }
}
```

In this example, we're using the `_fullText` property wrapper to directly set the initial value of the `@State` variable in the `init` method. This should allow you to initialize the value of the `@State` variable based on external data without encountering the error you were seeing.
