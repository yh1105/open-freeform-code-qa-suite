It looks like the package `aws-sdk-js` is not found in the npm registry. This is indicated by the `404 Not Found` error in the log. 

You can try running `npm cache clean` to clear your npm cache and then try running `npm install` again. If that doesn't work, you can try specifying a specific version of the package in your `package.json` file, like `"aws-sdk-js": "^2.0.0"`, and then running `npm install` again. 

If the issue persists, you can try using a different npm registry by running `npm config set registry https://registry.npmjs.org/` and then running `npm install` again.
