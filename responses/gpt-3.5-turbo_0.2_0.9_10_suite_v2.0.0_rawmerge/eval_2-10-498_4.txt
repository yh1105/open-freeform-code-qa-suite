In Rust, the caret operator (`^`) is not used for exponentiation. Instead, you can use the `pow` method that is available on the `num::Integer` trait. Here's an example:

```rust
use num::Integer;

fn main() {
    let base = 2;
    let exponent = 10;
    let result = base.pow(exponent);
    println!("{}^{} = {}", base, exponent, result);
}
```

This will output:

```
2^10 = 1024
```

Note that you need to import the `num::Integer` trait to use the `pow` method.
