Here are some steps you can try to solve the issue:

1. Make sure that you have the latest version of the Python extension installed in VS Code.

2. Check if the Jupyter server is running. Open a terminal in VS Code and type `jupyter notebook`. If it's not running, start it by typing `jupyter notebook` in the terminal.

3. Check if the correct kernel is selected. In the top right corner of the notebook, you should see the kernel name. Click on it and select the correct kernel.

4. Try to create a new virtual environment and install Jupyter in it. Activate the new environment and try to launch Jupyter notebook from within VS Code.

5. If none of the above steps work, try uninstalling and reinstalling Anaconda or Miniconda.

6. If the issue persists, try creating a new user profile in Windows and see if the issue occurs there as well. If not, the issue may be related to your user profile.

Hopefully, one of these steps will solve the issue for you.
