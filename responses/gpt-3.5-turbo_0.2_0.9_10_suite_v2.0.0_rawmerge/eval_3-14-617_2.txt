This error usually occurs when there is an issue with the build settings or the project file. Here are some steps you can try to resolve the issue:

1. Clean the project: Go to Product > Clean Build Folder in Xcode and try building the project again.

2. Check build settings: Make sure that the build settings are correct for the project. Check if there are any missing or incorrect settings.

3. Check for missing files: Make sure that all the required files are present in the project and are not missing.

4. Check for conflicting libraries: Check if there are any conflicting libraries in the project. Try removing the libraries one by one and see if the error goes away.

5. Update the pods: Try updating the pods to the latest version and see if the error goes away.

6. Check for any warnings: Check if there are any warnings in the project. Fixing the warnings may resolve the issue.

7. Try a different Xcode version: If none of the above steps work, try using a different version of Xcode and see if the error goes away.

Hopefully, one of these steps will help you resolve the issue.
