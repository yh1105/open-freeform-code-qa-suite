To create an index on a property in a Mongoose schema using Nest.js, you can use the `@Schema` decorator to define the schema and the `@Prop` decorator to define the properties. To create an index on a property, you can pass an object with the `index` property set to `true` as an option to the `@Prop` decorator.

Here's an example:

```javascript
import { Prop, Schema, SchemaFactory } from '@nestjs/mongoose';
import { Document } from 'mongoose';

@Schema()
export class MySchema extends Document {
  @Prop({ required: true, index: true })
  type: string;

  @Prop()
  creationDate: string;

  @Prop()
  name: string;
}

export const MySchema = SchemaFactory.createForClass(MySchema);
```

In this example, an index is created on the `type` property by passing `{ index: true }` as an option to the `@Prop` decorator.

You can also create indexes using the `SchemaFactory.createForClass()` method by chaining the `index()` method to the schema definition:

```javascript
export const MySchema = SchemaFactory.createForClass(MySchema).index({ type: 1 });
```

In this example, an index is created on the `type` property by calling the `index()` method on the schema definition and passing an object with the property name and the index direction (1 for ascending, -1 for descending).
