Here is the bash script you can use to install Python 3.6.5 using brew:

```
brew install python@3.6
```

This will install Python 3.6.5 as a separate package, and you can switch between different versions of Python using the `brew switch` command. For example, to switch to Python 3.6.5, you can run:

```
brew switch python 3.6.5
```

Note that you may need to update your PATH environment variable to use the newly installed version of Python.
