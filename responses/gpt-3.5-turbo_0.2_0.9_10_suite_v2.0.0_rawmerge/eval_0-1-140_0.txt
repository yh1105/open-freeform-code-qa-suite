With Font Awesome 5, the syntax for using icons in CSS has changed. You need to use the `font-family` property with the value `"Font Awesome 5 Free"` or `"Font Awesome 5 Pro"` depending on the version you are using. Additionally, you need to use the `content` property with the value `"\\f107"` instead of `"\f107"`. Here's the updated code:

```css
#mainNav .navbar-collapse .navbar-sidenav .nav-link-collapse:after {
  float: right;
  content: "\\f107";
  font-family: "Font Awesome 5 Free";
}
```

Make sure that you have included the Font Awesome 5 CSS file in your project and that the font files are in the correct directory.
