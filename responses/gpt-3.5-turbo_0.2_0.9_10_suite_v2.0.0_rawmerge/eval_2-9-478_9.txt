This error occurs because `reference` method was removed from `ActiveSupport::Dependencies` module in Rails 6.0. To fix this error, you need to upgrade your `devise` gem to version 4.8.1 or higher, which includes the fix for this issue.

To upgrade `devise` gem, you can update your `Gemfile` with the following line:

```
gem 'devise', '~> 4.8.1'
```

Then run `bundle update devise` to update the gem.

After updating the gem, you should be able to use `devise` without any issues.
