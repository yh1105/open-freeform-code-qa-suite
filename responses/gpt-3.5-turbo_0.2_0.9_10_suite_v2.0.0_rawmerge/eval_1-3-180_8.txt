To filter the data by `TEST_STATUS` column where the value is "PASS TEST" and group by `TEST_STATUS`, you can use the following code:

```python
data_useless[data_useless['TEST_STATUS'] == 'PASS TEST'].groupby('TEST_STATUS').count()
```

This will filter the data where `TEST_STATUS` is "PASS TEST" and group the data by `TEST_STATUS` and count the values of each column. The result will be a DataFrame with one row for "PASS TEST" and the count of each column for that row.
