The error message indicates that Selenium can't find the Firefox binary in its default location. This could be due to several reasons:

1. Firefox is not installed on your system.
2. Firefox is installed but not in the default location.
3. The path to Firefox is not set in the system's PATH environment variable.

Here are some solutions:

1. **Install Firefox**: If Firefox is not installed on your system, you should download and install it.

2. **Specify the Firefox Binary Location**: If Firefox is installed but not in the default location, you can specify the binary location in your code. Here's how you can do it:

```python
from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.firefox.service import Service
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By
from selenium.webdriver.firefox.options import Options as FirefoxOptions

options = FirefoxOptions()
options.binary_location = "/path/to/your/firefox/binary"
driver = webdriver.Firefox(service=Service("/path/to/your/geckodriver"), options=options)
driver.get('http://www.seleniumhq.org')
```

Replace `"/path/to/your/firefox/binary"` with the actual path to your Firefox binary, and `"/path/to/your/geckodriver"` with the actual path to your Geckodriver.

3. **Set the PATH Environment Variable**: If the path to Firefox is not set in your system's PATH environment variable, you can add it. The process to do this varies depending on your operating system.

For **Windows**:

- Right-click on 'My Computer' and select 'Properties'.
- Click on 'Advanced System Settings'.
- Click on 'Environment Variables'.
- Under 'System Variables', find the 'Path' variable, select it, and click on 'Edit'.
- In the 'Variable value' field, add the path to your Firefox binary.

For **Linux/Mac**:

- Open a terminal.
- If you use bash, edit `~/.bashrc`. If you use zsh, edit `~/.zshrc`.
- Add this line at the end of the file: `export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/your/firefox/binary`
- Save the file and exit.
- Run `source ~/.bashrc` or `source ~/.zshrc` to reload the file.
- Verify that the path is set correctly by running `echo $PATH`.

Remember to replace `"/path/to/your/firefox/binary"` with the
