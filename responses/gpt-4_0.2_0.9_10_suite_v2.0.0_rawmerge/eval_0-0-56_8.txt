The issue you're experiencing is likely due to the fact that Vite's server is binding to `localhost` (127.0.0.1) by default, which is not accessible outside of the Docker container. 

To fix this, you need to configure Vite to bind to `0.0.0.0` so that it can accept connections from any IP address. You can do this by modifying your `vite.config.ts` file as follows:

```typescript
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import vue from '@vitejs/plugin-vue'

// https://vitejs.dev/config/
export default defineConfig({
    resolve: { alias: { '@': '/src' } },
    plugins: [vue()],
    server: {
        host: '0.0.0.0', // Add this line
        port: 8080
    }
})
```

This tells Vite to listen on all network interfaces, which should allow you to access your application from outside the Docker container. 

After making this change, you should be able to access your application by visiting `localhost:8080` in your browser or by using `curl localhost:8080` from your command line.
