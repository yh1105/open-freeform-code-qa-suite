To conform to the `ShapeStyle` protocol, you need to implement the `func _apply(to shape: inout _ShapeStyle_ShapeType)` method. However, this method is part of SwiftUI's private API and not intended for direct use.

Instead, you can create a struct that conforms to `ShapeStyle` and uses a `Color` to fill a shape. Here's how you can do it:

```swift
struct MyContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        Circle()
            .fill(RedShapeStyle())
    }
}

struct RedShapeStyle: ShapeStyle {
    func _apply(to shape: inout _ShapeStyle_ShapeType) {
        Color.red._apply(to: &shape)
    }
}
```

Please note that using private APIs is generally not recommended as they can change without notice and can lead to your app being rejected from the App Store.
