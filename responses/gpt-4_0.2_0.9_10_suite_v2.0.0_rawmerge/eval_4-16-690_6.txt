Starting with macOS Catalina 10.15, the default shell is zsh and not bash. Therefore, `.bash_profile` or `.profile` will not be sourced if you're using zsh.

If you want to set environment variables for your shell sessions, you should add them to the `.zshrc` file in your home directory. If the file doesn't exist, you can create it.

Here's how you can do it:

1. Open Terminal.
2. Type `nano ~/.zshrc` to open this file in a text editor.
3. Add your export statement to the file:

    ```
    export JBOSS_HOME=/Users/{USERNAME}/Desktop/jboss7
    ```

4. Press `Control+O` to save the changes, then `Control+X` to exit the editor.
5. Type `source ~/.zshrc` to manually source the `.zshrc` file or simply close and reopen your Terminal.

Now, when you type `echo $JBOSS_HOME` in a new Terminal window, it should display the path you specified.

If you want to continue using bash instead of zsh, you can change your default shell back to bash by using the `chsh -s /bin/bash` command in the Terminal. But please note that bash is deprecated in macOS Catalina and newer versions.
