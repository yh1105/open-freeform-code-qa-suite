Yes, you can convert your OpenSSH private key to a RSA private key. Here is the command you need to run:

```bash
ssh-keygen -p -m PEM -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```

This command will ask for your passphrase (if you have one), and then it will write the RSA private key out to the same file (`~/.ssh/id_rsa`).

As for your second question, you don't need to convert your public key. The public key format is standard and does not need to be converted. The public key file (`id_rsa.pub`) is used by the server to authenticate you. As long as the server has your public key and you have your private key, you should be able to authenticate successfully.

Please note that the above command will overwrite your existing private key file. If you want to keep your existing OpenSSH private key, you should make a backup of it before running the command. You can do this with the following command:

```bash
cp ~/.ssh/id_rsa ~/.ssh/id_rsa_backup
```
