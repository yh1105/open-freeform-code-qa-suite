Sure, you need to mock the class and its constructor. Here is the revised version of your code:

```javascript
import API from 'utils/API';

jest.mock('utils/API', () => {
  return jest.fn().mockImplementation(() => {
    return {someMethod: () => {}};
  });
});
```

In this code, `jest.fn().mockImplementation()` is used to mock the implementation of the `API` class. This way, when you call `new API()`, it will return an object with `someMethod` as a function.
