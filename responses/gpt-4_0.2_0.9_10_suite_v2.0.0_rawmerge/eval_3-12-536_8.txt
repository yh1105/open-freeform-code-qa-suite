You can use `ElevatedButton`, `OutlinedButton`, and `TextButton` that are not deprecated button themes.
You can change the `shape` property which is placed in the `style` property.

Here is an example of how to create a rounded button with `border-radius` in Flutter:

```dart
ElevatedButton(
  onPressed: () {},
  child: Text('Button'),
  style: ElevatedButton.styleFrom(
    shape: RoundedRectangleBorder(
      borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(20), // Change this to your desired radius
    ),
  ),
)
```

In this example, `ElevatedButton` is used. You can replace it with `OutlinedButton` or `TextButton` based on your needs. The `shape` property is placed in the `style` property, and it's set to `RoundedRectangleBorder` with a `borderRadius` of your choice.
