You can use the `.toast('show')` method to display the toast. Here's how you can modify your JavaScript code:

```javascript
$('.toast').toast('show');
```

This will show the toast when the page loads. If you want to show the toast on a specific event, like a button click, you can use something like this:

```javascript
$('#myButton').click(function() {
  $('.toast').toast('show');
});
```

In this case, the toast will show up when the element with the id `myButton` is clicked.

Also, make sure you have included the necessary Bootstrap CSS and JS files in your HTML file.
