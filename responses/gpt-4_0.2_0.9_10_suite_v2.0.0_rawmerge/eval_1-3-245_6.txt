The error message `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'app'` is indicating that Python cannot find the module 'app'. This could be due to the structure of your project or the way you are referencing your application in the Dockerfile.

Here is a revised version of your Dockerfile:

```Dockerfile
# Use an official Python runtime as a parent image
FROM python:3.8

# Set the working directory in the container to /app
WORKDIR /app

# Add the current directory contents into the container at /app
ADD . /app

# Install any needed packages specified in requirements.txt
COPY requirements.txt /app
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Make port 8000 available to the world outside this container
EXPOSE 8000

# Run the command to start uVicorn
CMD ["uvicorn", "app.main:app", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "8000", "--reload"]
```

This Dockerfile will add the entire current directory (which should be your project directory) to the Docker image. It then installs the Python dependencies and starts the application.

Please make sure that your `docker-compose.yml` file is correctly set up and that you are running the `docker-compose up -d` command from the correct directory (it should be the same directory where your `docker-compose.yml` file is located). 

Also, ensure that your `main.py` file is correctly importing the `app` module. If your `main.py` file is located in the same directory as your `app` module, you might need to use a relative import like `from . import app` or `import .app`.
