The `ext-zip` is a PHP extension, not a Composer package. You can't install it via Composer. You need to install it via your PHP installation.

If you are using Linux, you can install it via the following command:

```bash
sudo apt-get install php-zip
```

If you are using Windows, you need to enable it in your `php.ini` file. Find the line `;extension=php_zip.dll` and remove the semicolon at the beginning.

After installing or enabling the extension, you need to restart your web server.

Then, you can add the extension to your `composer.json` file as a platform requirement:

```json
"require": {
    "php": "^7.1.3",
    "ext-zip": "*"
}
```

This won't install the extension, but it will prevent Composer from installing packages that require a version of the extension that you don't have.
