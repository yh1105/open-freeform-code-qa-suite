The error message you're seeing suggests that the `--add-opens` option is not recognized. This is likely because this option is not available in Java 8, which you're using according to your `java -version` output. The `--add-opens` option is a JVM argument introduced in Java 9 to relax the strong encapsulation of Java platform modules.

Hyperledger Besu requires Java 11 or later to run. You can download it from the [official Oracle website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html) or use OpenJDK which can be downloaded from [AdoptOpenJDK](https://adoptopenjdk.net/).

After installing Java 11 or later, you can verify the installation by running `java -version` again in your terminal. The output should indicate that you're running Java 11 or later. Once you've done this, try running the `bin\besu --help` command again.

If you still encounter issues, ensure that your `JAVA_HOME` environment variable points to your Java 11 installation and that your `PATH` includes `$JAVA_HOME/bin` (or `%JAVA_HOME%\bin` on Windows).
