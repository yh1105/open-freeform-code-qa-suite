Angular CLI does not provide a specific command to remove a package. However, you can remove a package manually by following these steps:

1. Open your `package.json` file.
2. Find the package you want to remove in the `dependencies` or `devDependencies` section and delete it.
3. Run `npm install` to update your `node_modules` folder and `package-lock.json` file.

Alternatively, you can use npm or yarn to remove the package:

- If you are using npm, run `npm uninstall <package>` in your terminal.
- If you are using yarn, run `yarn remove <package>` in your terminal.

Remember to replace `<package>` with the name of the package you want to remove.
