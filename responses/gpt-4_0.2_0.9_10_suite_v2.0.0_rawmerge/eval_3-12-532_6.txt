The error `FormatException: Unexpected character (at character 1)` usually occurs when the response from the server is not a valid JSON. 

Here are some steps to debug and solve this issue:

1. **Check the server response:** Print the server response before decoding it to JSON. This will help you to understand what you are receiving from the server.

```dart
print('Response body: ${response.body}');
```

2. **Check the server-side script:** Make sure that your PHP script is returning a valid JSON. You can use `json_encode()` function in PHP to convert an array or object into a JSON formatted string.

3. **Check the response status code:** Before decoding the response body, check the status code of the response. If the status code is not 200, it means there is an error on the server-side.

```dart
if (response.statusCode == 200) {
  List data = json.decode(response.body);
} else {
  print('Request failed with status: ${response.statusCode}.');
}
```

4. **Handle exceptions:** Wrap your JSON decoding inside a try-catch block to handle any exceptions that might occur.

```dart
try {
  List data = json.decode(response.body);
} catch (e) {
  print('Error: $e');
}
```

By following these steps, you should be able to identify and fix the issue causing the `FormatException`.
