The code you posted is correct, but it seems like you're missing the part where `isSelected` is being changed from outside `ContentView`. 

`@Binding` is a two-way connection to a `@State` property owned by a parent view. It allows you to read and write the value, but the parent view is still the source of truth. 

In your case, `ContentView` is trying to modify `isSelected`, but there's no parent view that owns a `@State` variable that is bound to `isSelected`.

Here's an example of how you could use it:

```swift
struct ParentView: View {
    @State private var isSelected: Bool = false

    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            ContentView(isSelected: $isSelected)
            Text("Is selected: \(isSelected.description)")
        }
    }
}

struct ContentView: View {
    @Binding var isSelected: Bool

    var body: some View {
        Button(action: {
            self.isSelected.toggle()
        }) {
            Text(isSelected ? "Selected" : "Not Selected")
        }
    }
}
```

In this example, `ParentView` owns `isSelected` and `ContentView` can modify it through the `@Binding`. When `ContentView` modifies `isSelected`, the `ParentView` is updated because it's observing `isSelected`.
