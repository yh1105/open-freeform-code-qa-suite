The error message suggests that Laravel is unable to write or delete files in the directory where it stores its cache. This is typically a permissions issue. Laravel needs to be able to write to the `storage` and `bootstrap/cache` directories.

You can try to fix this by changing the owner of these directories to the user that the web server is running as, or by changing the permissions so that the user you are running the `php artisan cache:clear` command as can write to these directories.

Here's how you can change the permissions:

```bash
sudo chmod -R 755 storage
sudo chmod -R 755 bootstrap/cache
```

And here's how you can change the owner (replace `www-data` with the actual user the web server runs as):

```bash
sudo chown -R www-data:www-data storage
sudo chown -R www-data:www-data bootstrap/cache
```

Remember to run these commands from the root directory of your Laravel project.
