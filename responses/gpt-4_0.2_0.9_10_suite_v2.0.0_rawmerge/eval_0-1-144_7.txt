You can change the color of the accordion arrow by targeting the `::after` pseudo-element of the `.accordion-button` class. This pseudo-element is used by Bootstrap to create the arrow.

Here's how you can do it:

```css
.accordion-button:not(.collapsed)::after {
    /* This is the arrow when the accordion is expanded */
    color: green;
}

.accordion-button.collapsed::after {
    /* This is the arrow when the accordion is collapsed */
    color: green;
}
```

This CSS code will change the color of the arrow to green both when the accordion is expanded and when it is collapsed.

Please note that you need to include this CSS after the Bootstrap CSS in your HTML file, so that it overrides the default Bootstrap styles.
