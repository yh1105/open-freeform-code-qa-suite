The error message `ImportError: DLL load failed while importing _psycopg: The operating system cannot run %1.` suggests that there might be a problem with the psycopg2 binary compatibility with your system.

Here are a few things you could try:

1. **Reinstall psycopg2-binary**: Sometimes, the issue can be resolved by installing `psycopg2-binary` instead of `psycopg2`. You can do this with the following command:

    ```bash
    pip uninstall psycopg2
    pip install psycopg2-binary
    ```

    Note: `psycopg2-binary` is a stand-alone package (it includes its own PostgreSQL binary libraries) and it's easier to install, but it might not be as efficient as compiling the package from source.

2. **Check your Python version**: Make sure you are using a Python version that is compatible with the psycopg2 version you are trying to install. You can check your Python version with the command `python --version`.

3. **Check your PostgreSQL version**: Make sure you have a compatible version of PostgreSQL installed on your system. You can check your PostgreSQL version with the command `psql --version`.

4. **Check your system architecture**: Make sure your Python, PostgreSQL, and psycopg2 versions are all either 32-bit or 64-bit. Mixing 32-bit and 64-bit versions can cause issues.

5. **Check PATH environment variable**: Make sure the PostgreSQL binary directory is in your system's PATH environment variable. This directory contains the DLL files that psycopg2 needs to run.

If none of these solutions work, you might want to consider using a different PostgreSQL adapter, like `pg8000` or `SQLAlchemy`.
