Font Awesome 5 has made some changes in the way it is used compared to Font Awesome 4. The main change is that the font-family is now specified as either "Font Awesome 5 Free", "Font Awesome 5 Brands", or "Font Awesome 5 Pro" depending on the type of icon you are using.

Also, they have introduced a new CSS property, `font-weight`, which should be set to 900 for solid icons, 400 for regular and light icons.

Here is how you can modify your CSS to work with Font Awesome 5:

```css
#mainNav .navbar-collapse .navbar-sidenav .nav-link-collapse:after {
  float: right;
  content: "\f107";
  font-family: "Font Awesome 5 Free"; /* or "Font Awesome 5 Brands" or "Font Awesome 5 Pro" */
  font-weight: 900; /* 400 for regular and light icons */
}
```

Please replace the `font-family` with the appropriate one based on the type of icon you are using. If you are using a free version, then it should be "Font Awesome 5 Free". If you are using brand icons, then it should be "Font Awesome 5 Brands". If you are using a pro version, then it should be "Font Awesome 5 Pro".

Also, please note that not all Font Awesome 4 icons have a direct equivalent in Font Awesome 5, so you may need to check the Font Awesome 5 icon gallery to find the equivalent icon.
