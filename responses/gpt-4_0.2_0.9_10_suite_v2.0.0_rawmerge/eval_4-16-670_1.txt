Yes, you can convert your OpenSSH private key to a traditional RSA private key using the `ssh-keygen` tool. Here's how:

1. Convert OpenSSH private key to RSA private key:

```bash
ssh-keygen -p -m PEM -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```

This command will prompt you for the passphrase (if any) of your private key. After entering the passphrase, your private key will be re-written in place in the RSA format. The `-p` option tells `ssh-keygen` to change the passphrase of a private key file, `-m PEM` tells it to use the older PEM private key format instead of the new OpenSSH format, and `-f ~/.ssh/id_rsa` specifies the path to the private key file.

2. You don't need to convert your public key. The public key format is standard and doesn't need to be converted when you convert your private key. The public key file (`id_rsa.pub`) doesn't have a header like the private key because it's format is different and simpler. It can be used as is.

Please note that this conversion doesn't change the actual key, it just changes the format of the file. The key pair remains the same, and you don't need to send a new public key to the server administrator.
