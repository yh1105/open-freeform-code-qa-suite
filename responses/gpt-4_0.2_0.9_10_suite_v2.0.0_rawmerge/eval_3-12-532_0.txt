The error you're encountering is due to the fact that the response you're getting from your server is not a valid JSON string. The `FormatException: Unexpected character (at character 1)` error is thrown when `json.decode()` tries to parse a string that does not start with either `{` or `[`, the beginning characters of a JSON object or array, respectively.

Here are some steps you can take to debug and solve this issue:

1. **Check the server response**: Print the server response before trying to decode it. This will help you see exactly what you're trying to parse.

    ```dart
    print('Response body: ${response.body}');
    ```

    If the printed response is not a valid JSON string, then you've found the source of your problem. The issue could be with the server-side PHP script.

2. **Check the server-side PHP script**: Make sure your PHP script is correctly outputting a JSON string. You can use `json_encode()` to convert an array or object into a JSON string in PHP. Also, ensure that no characters (including whitespace or error messages) are being output before the JSON string.

3. **Handle non-200 HTTP status codes**: If the server returns a non-200 HTTP status code, the `response.body` may not contain a valid JSON string. You can check the status code like this:

    ```dart
    if (response.statusCode == 200) {
      List data = json.decode(response.body);
      // ...
    } else {
      print('Request failed with status: ${response.statusCode}.');
    }
    ```

4. **Catch and handle exceptions**: You can catch the `FormatException` and handle it gracefully, perhaps by showing an error message to the user.

    ```dart
    try {
      List data = json.decode(response.body);
      // ...
    } catch (e) {
      print('Error: $e');
    }
    ```

By following these steps, you should be able to identify and fix the issue causing the `FormatException`.
