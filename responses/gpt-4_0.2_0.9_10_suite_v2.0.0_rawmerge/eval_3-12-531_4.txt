The warning is due to the fact that Dart's `Map` interface returns a nullable value when you access a key. This is because the key might not exist in the map, so it could potentially return `null`. 

To solve the warning, you can either change the type of `s` to `String?` or use the `!` operator to cast the right-hand side to `String`. 

Here are the two solutions:

**Solution 1: Changing the type of `s` to `String?`**

```dart
void foo(Map<int, String> myMap) {
  if (myMap.containsKey(1)) {
    String? s = myMap[1];
  }
}
```

**Solution 2: Using the `!` operator to cast the right-hand side to `String`**

```dart
void foo(Map<int, String> myMap) {
  if (myMap.containsKey(1)) {
    String s = myMap[1]!;
  }
}
```

Please note that using the `!` operator can cause a runtime error if the value is `null`. So, it's safer to use it only when you are sure that the value is not `null`. In this case, you are checking if the key exists before accessing it, so it should be safe.
