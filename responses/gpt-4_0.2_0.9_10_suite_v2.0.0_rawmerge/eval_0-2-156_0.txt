It seems like you want to align the "Stop Game" button with the "Begin Game" button. To do this, you can use CSS to position the buttons. Here are a few methods:

1. **Flexbox**: You can use CSS Flexbox to align items along a horizontal or vertical line. For example, you can make `#DanceScoreboard` a flex container and align its children (`#GameStopped` and `#GameRunning`) in a column. Then, you can use `justify-content: space-between;` to distribute the space between the children evenly.

```css
#DanceScoreboard {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  justify-content: space-between;
}
```

2. **Grid**: CSS Grid is another powerful tool for layout design. You can define a grid on the `#DanceScoreboard` and place the children in the grid cells.

```css
#DanceScoreboard {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-rows: 1fr 1fr;
}
```

3. **Positioning**: You can use CSS positioning to place the buttons. This method requires more manual work and may not be as flexible as the previous methods. For example, you can use `position: absolute;` to position the buttons relative to the `#DanceScoreboard`.

```css
#StartBtn {
  position: absolute;
  top: 0;
}

#StopBtn {
  position: absolute;
  top: 50px; /* adjust this value as needed */
}
```

Remember to adjust these examples according to your needs. You may need to add more CSS properties to achieve the desired layout.
