GitLab CI/CD uses a simple variable substitution method, which doesn't support nested variable expansion like Bash does. This is why your nested parameter expansion isn't working as expected.

In your case, you can use a script to achieve the same result:

```yaml
job1:
  script:
    - |
      if [[ -n "$CI_MERGE_REQUEST_SOURCE_BRANCH_NAME" ]]; then
        GIT_BRANCH=$CI_MERGE_REQUEST_SOURCE_BRANCH_NAME
      elif [[ -n "$CI_COMMIT_BRANCH" ]]; then
        GIT_BRANCH=$CI_COMMIT_BRANCH
      else
        GIT_BRANCH=$CI_DEFAULT_BRANCH
      fi
      echo $GIT_BRANCH
```

This script will check the variables in order and assign the first non-empty one to `GIT_BRANCH`.
