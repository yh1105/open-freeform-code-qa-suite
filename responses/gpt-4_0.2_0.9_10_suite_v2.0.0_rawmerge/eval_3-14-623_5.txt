This issue can be caused by a variety of factors, but here are a few solutions that have worked for other developers:

1. **Clean Build Folder**

   Try to clean the build folder in Xcode. You can do this by going to `Product -> Clean Build Folder` or by pressing `Shift + Command + K`.

2. **Delete Derived Data**

   You can delete derived data by going to `Window -> Organizer -> Projects -> Your Project -> Delete Derived Data`.

3. **Update CocoaPods**

   If you're using CocoaPods, make sure you're using the latest version. You can update CocoaPods by running `sudo gem install cocoapods` in Terminal.

4. **Reinstall Pods**

   Try reinstalling your pods. You can do this by running `pod deintegrate` and then `pod install` in Terminal.

5. **Check Swift Version**

   Make sure all your pods are compatible with the Swift version you're using. You can specify the Swift version for each pod in the Podfile like this:

   ```markdown
   post_install do |installer|
       installer.pods_project.targets.each do |target|
           target.build_configurations.each do |config|
               config.build_settings['SWIFT_VERSION'] = '4.2'
           end
       end
   end
   ```

6. **Disable Incremental Builds**

   In some cases, disabling incremental builds can solve the problem. You can do this by going to `File -> Project/Workspace Settings` and setting `Build System` to `Legacy Build System`.

If none of these solutions work, the problem might be with one of your pods. Try removing them one by one to see if the problem persists.
