You can use the `openpyxl` library in Python to write a list of lists into an Excel file. Here is the function `writeToExcel` you asked for:

```python
from openpyxl import Workbook

def writeExcel():
    new_list = [["first", "second"], ["third", "fourth"]]
    wb = Workbook()
    ws = wb.active

    for i in range(len(new_list)):
        for j in range(len(new_list[i])):
            ws.cell(row=i+1, column=j+1, value=new_list[i][j])

    wb.save("data.xlsx")
```

This function creates a new Excel workbook, gets the active worksheet, and then iterates over the list of lists, writing each value to the appropriate cell in the worksheet. Finally, it saves the workbook to a file named "data.xlsx".

Please make sure to install the `openpyxl` library before running this code. You can install it using pip:

```shell
pip install openpyxl
```
