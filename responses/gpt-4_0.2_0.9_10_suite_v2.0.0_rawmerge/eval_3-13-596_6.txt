Yes, you can disallow Gradle from generating the `*.plain.jar` file. Starting from Spring Boot 2.5.0, the plugin generates a plain jar alongside the fat jar. You can disable this behavior by configuring the `bootJar` task in your `build.gradle` file like this:

```groovy
bootJar {
    enabled = false
}
```

This will prevent the generation of the `*.plain.jar` file.
