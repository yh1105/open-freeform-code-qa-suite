You can use `awk` to extract the language code. The `awk` command is a powerful tool for text processing. Here is how you can modify your command:

```bash
curl -Ls stick-it.app | grep -o 'lang="[a-zA-Z-]*"' | head -1 | awk -F'"' '{print $2}'
```

Here is what each part of the command does:

- `curl -Ls stick-it.app`: Fetches the content of the page.
- `grep -o 'lang="[a-zA-Z-]*"'`: Searches for the `lang` attribute. The `-o` option tells `grep` to only output the part of the line that matches the pattern.
- `head -1`: Takes only the first match.
- `awk -F'"' '{print $2}'`: Splits the line on the `"` character and prints the second field, which is the language code.

This command will work regardless of where the `lang` attribute is on the line.
