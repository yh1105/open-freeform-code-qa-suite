The error message you're seeing is because `req.logout()` is not a function in Express.js by default. It's added by Passport.js when you use it as middleware. 

In your case, you are using Passport.js correctly and `req.logout()` should be available. The error you're seeing might be due to the request not being authenticated when the `/logout` route is hit. 

However, Passport.js is designed to fail silently if `req.logout()` is called when no user is authenticated. This means that the error might be coming from somewhere else in your code.

That said, your logout route seems to be correct. Here is the correct way to implement a logout route with Passport.js:

```javascript
app.get('/logout', function(req, res){
  req.logout();
  res.redirect('/');
});
```

This is exactly what you have in your code. 

If you're still seeing the error, I would recommend checking other parts of your code to make sure you're not calling `req.logout()` somewhere else without an authenticated user.
