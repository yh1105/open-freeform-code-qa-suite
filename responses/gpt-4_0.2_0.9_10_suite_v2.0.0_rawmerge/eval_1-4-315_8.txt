Here is a function in R that will concatenate every two columns starting from `X2`:

```r
concat <- function(df) {
  # Create a new data frame with the column X1
  new_df <- data.frame(X1 = df$X1)
  
  # Concatenate every two columns starting from X2
  new_df$X2 <- paste(df$X2, df$X3, sep = "")
  new_df$X3 <- paste(df$X4, df$X5, sep = "")
  new_df$X4 <- paste(df$X6, df$X7, sep = "")
  
  return(new_df)
}
```

This function works by first creating a new data frame with the column `X1` from the input data frame. Then, it concatenates every two columns starting from `X2` using the `paste` function with the `sep` argument set to `""` (empty string), which means that the values will be concatenated without any separator. The results are then assigned to the corresponding columns in the new data frame. Finally, the new data frame is returned.

Please note that this function assumes that the input data frame has exactly the structure specified in the question (i.e., columns `X1` to `X7`). If the structure of the input data frame is different, the function may not work as expected.
