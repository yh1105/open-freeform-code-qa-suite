This issue might be due to the SwiftUI Preview not being associated with a target. Here's how you can fix it:

1. Click on the file that contains your `ContentView_Previews`.
2. In the right-hand side panel, under the "Target Membership" section, make sure your app's target is checked.

If the target is already checked, try the following:

1. Clean the build folder (Product -> Clean Build Folder).
2. Close Xcode.
3. Delete the derived data folder (`~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData`).
4. Restart your Mac.
5. Open your project and try again.

If the issue persists, it might be a bug with Xcode 12.3. You can try updating to a newer version of Xcode if available, or downgrading to a previous stable version.
