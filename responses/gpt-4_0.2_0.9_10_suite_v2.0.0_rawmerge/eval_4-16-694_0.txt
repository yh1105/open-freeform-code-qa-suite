You can use `awk` to extract the language code. Here is an example:

```bash
curl -Ls stick-it.app | grep -o 'lang="[a-zA-Z-]*"' | head -1 | awk -F'"' '{print $2}'
```

Here is how it works:

- `curl -Ls stick-it.app` fetches the content of the page.
- `grep -o 'lang="[a-zA-Z-]*"'` extracts the `lang` attribute. The `-o` option tells `grep` to print only the matched parts of a matching line. The regular expression `'lang="[a-zA-Z-]*"'` matches the `lang` attribute and its value.
- `head -1` gets the first match.
- `awk -F'"' '{print $2}'` splits the line by the double quote character and prints the second field, which is the language code.

This command should work regardless of the position of the `lang` attribute in the tag.
