You can use the `date` command in Unix to convert the date format. Here is a simple script that reads each line from the file, converts the date, and prints it:

```bash
while IFS= read -r line
do
    date -d "${line:0:10}" '+%d %b %Y'
done < filename.txt
```

This script reads the file `filename.txt` line by line. For each line, it extracts the first 10 characters (which is the date in `YYYY-MM-DD` format), converts it to `DD MMM YYYY` format using the `date` command, and prints it.

Note: The `%b` format in the `date` command prints the abbreviated month name, which is in uppercase. If you want the month name in lowercase, you can use `tr` command to convert it:

```bash
while IFS= read -r line
do
    date -d "${line:0:10}" '+%d %b %Y' | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]'
done < filename.txt
```
