You can use the following function in PowerShell to check if a specified folder is in your PATH:

```powershell
function FolderIsInPATH($Path_to_directory) {
    $path = $env:Path -split ';'
    return $path -contains $Path_to_directory
}
```

This function splits the PATH environment variable at each semicolon (since paths are separated by semicolons) and checks if the specified directory is in the resulting array. It returns `$true` if the directory is in the PATH, and `$false` otherwise.
