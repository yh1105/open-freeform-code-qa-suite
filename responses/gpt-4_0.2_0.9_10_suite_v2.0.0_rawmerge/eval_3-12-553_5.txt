The error message indicates that your app isn't using AndroidX. AndroidX is a major improvement to the original Android Support Library, which is no longer maintained. AndroidX maps the original support library API packages into the androidx namespace. 

To migrate your app to AndroidX, you can follow these steps:

1. Backup your project.
2. Open your project's `android/gradle.properties` file.
3. Add the following lines to the file:

```markdown
android.useAndroidX=true
android.enableJetifier=true
```

4. Save the file.
5. Open your project's `android/app/build.gradle` file.
6. Update the `compileSdkVersion` and `targetSdkVersion` to `28` or higher:

```markdown
android {
    compileSdkVersion 28

    defaultConfig {
        // ...
        targetSdkVersion 28
        // ...
    }
}
```

7. Save the file.
8. Run `flutter clean` in your terminal to clean your project.
9. Run `flutter pub get` in your terminal to get the packages again.
10. Try to build your app again.

If you still encounter issues, you might need to manually migrate your dependencies to their AndroidX equivalents. You can refer to the [official AndroidX migration guide](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/migrate) for more details.
