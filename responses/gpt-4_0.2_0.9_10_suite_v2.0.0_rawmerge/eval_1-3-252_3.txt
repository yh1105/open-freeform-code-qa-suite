You can use the `groupby` method of pandas DataFrame to group the data by column 'A' and then use the `idxmin` method to get the index of the minimum value in column 'B'. After that, use the `loc` method to select these rows. Here is the function:

```python
import pandas as pd

def getMin(df):
    return df.loc[df.groupby('A')['B'].idxmin()]
```

This function works as follows:

1. `df.groupby('A')['B'].idxmin()` groups the DataFrame by column 'A' and gets the index of the minimum value in column 'B' for each group.
2. `df.loc[...]` selects the rows with these indices from the DataFrame.

So, if you call this function with your DataFrame, it will return the rows with the minimum 'B' value for each 'A' value.
