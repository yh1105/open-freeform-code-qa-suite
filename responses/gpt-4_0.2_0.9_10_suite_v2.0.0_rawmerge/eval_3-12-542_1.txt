The issue you're facing is due to the default behavior of the Scaffold widget in Flutter. When the keyboard appears, the Scaffold widget adjusts its layout to accommodate the keyboard. This is why your bottom navigation bar is moving up along with the keyboard.

To prevent this behavior, you can set the `resizeToAvoidBottomInset` property of the Scaffold widget to `false`. This will tell the Scaffold not to resize when the keyboard appears.

Here's how you can modify your code:

```dart
class _AppHomeViewState extends State<AppHomeView>
    with TickerProviderStateMixin {

  TabController tabController;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    tabController = TabController(length: 4, vsync: this, initialIndex: 0);
    tabController.addListener(handleTabSelection);
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    final scaffold = Scaffold(
      resizeToAvoidBottomInset: false, // Add this line
      body: SafeArea(child: _buildBody(context)),
      bottomNavigationBar: Container(
        height: 48,
        decoration: BoxDecoration(
          color: StyledColors.BACKGROUND_COLOR,
          boxShadow: [
            BoxShadow(
              color: StyledColors.FORGROUND_COLOR.withOpacity(0.16),
              blurRadius: 12,
              offset: Offset(0, 0),
            ),
          ],
        ),
        child: SafeArea(
          child: _buildTabBar(context),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
  ...
}
```

Please note that setting `resizeToAvoidBottomInset` to `false` may cause your content to be obscured by the keyboard. You may need to adjust your layout accordingly to ensure that all important content is still visible when the keyboard is displayed.
