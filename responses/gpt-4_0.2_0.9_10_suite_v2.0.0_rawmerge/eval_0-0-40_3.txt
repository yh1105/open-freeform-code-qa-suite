The issue you're encountering is due to the fact that your `npm` command is trying to use the Windows version of Node.js, which is installed in `/mnt/c/Program Files/nodejs/npm`. This is not compatible with the WSL environment.

To solve this issue, you need to make sure that the WSL environment uses the Node.js and npm versions installed in the Linux subsystem, not the Windows versions.

You can achieve this by adding the following lines to your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc` file:

```bash
export PATH="/usr/bin:$PATH"
```

This line will ensure that the binaries in `/usr/bin` (where your Linux version of Node.js and npm are located) will be prioritized over the ones in the Windows directories.

After adding this line, you need to source your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc` file to apply the changes:

```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```

or

```bash
source ~/.zshrc
```

Now, if you run `node -v` and `npm -v`, you should see the correct versions that are installed in your WSL environment.
