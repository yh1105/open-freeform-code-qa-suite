You can achieve this by simply not replacing the special characters with a space, but with an empty string. Here's how you can modify your code:

```vba
Sub ReplaceSpecial()
    Dim cel As Range
    Dim strVal As String
    Dim i As Long
    Application.ScreenUpdating = False
    For Each cel In Selection
        strVal = cel.Value
        For i = 1 To Len(strVal)
            Select Case Asc(Mid(strVal, i, 1))
                Case 48 To 57, 65 To 90, 97 To 122
                    ' Leave ordinary characters alone
                Case Else
                    Mid(strVal, i, 1) = ""
            End Select
        Next i
        cel.Value = strVal
    Next cel
    Application.ScreenUpdating = True
End Sub
```

However, this code will not work because VBA does not allow you to replace a character in a string with an empty string using the `Mid` function. Strings in VBA are immutable, which means once a string is created, it cannot be changed.

Instead, you can use the `Replace` function in VBA to replace each special character with an empty string. Here's how you can modify your code:

```vba
Sub ReplaceSpecial()
    Dim cel As Range
    Dim strVal As String
    Dim i As Long
    Application.ScreenUpdating = False
    For Each cel In Selection
        strVal = cel.Value
        For i = 1 To Len(strVal)
            Select Case Asc(Mid(strVal, i, 1))
                Case 48 To 57, 65 To 90, 97 To 122
                    ' Leave ordinary characters alone
                Case Else
                    strVal = Replace(strVal, Mid(strVal, i, 1), "")
                    i = i - 1 ' Adjust counter as length of string has decreased
            End Select
        Next i
        cel.Value = strVal
    Next cel
    Application.ScreenUpdating = True
End Sub
```

This code will replace each special character with an empty string, effectively removing it from the string.
