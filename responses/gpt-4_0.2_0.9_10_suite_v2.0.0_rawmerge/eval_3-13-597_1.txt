In Kotlin, you can use the `ArrayList` constructor with an initial capacity if you know the eventual number of elements in advance. This is a perfectly valid `MutableList`. This approach can help to optimize performance by reducing the number of memory reallocations.

Here is an example:

```kotlin
val list = ArrayList<Int>(initialCapacity)
```

So, your first option is the recommended solution in this case. It's idiomatic Kotlin and it's also efficient.
