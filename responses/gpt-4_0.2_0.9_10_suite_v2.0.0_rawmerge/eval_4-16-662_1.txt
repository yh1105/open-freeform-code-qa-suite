You can use `jq` to minify JSON in a shell script. `jq` is a lightweight and flexible command-line JSON processor. If it's not installed, you can install it using a package manager like `apt` for Ubuntu, `brew` for MacOS, etc.

Here is an example of how you can use `jq` to minify JSON:

```bash
echo '{
    "foo": "lorem",
    "bar": "ipsum"
}' | jq -c .
```

This will output:

```bash
{"foo":"lorem","bar":"ipsum"}
```

In this command, `jq -c .` means "compact output" (`-c`) and "take the input as it is" (`.`).
