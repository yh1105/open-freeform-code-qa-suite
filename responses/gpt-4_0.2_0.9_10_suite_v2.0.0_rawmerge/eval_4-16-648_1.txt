The error message you're seeing suggests that the `/data` directory is on a read-only file system. This could be due to a few reasons:

1. The directory is on a mounted drive that is read-only.
2. The directory is protected by System Integrity Protection (SIP).

In macOS Catalina and later versions, the system disk is split into two volumes: one for the system files and another for data. The system volume is mounted as read-only to prevent modifications.

If you're trying to create a directory at the root level, it's likely that you're trying to create it on the system volume, which is why you're seeing this error.

Instead, you should create directories in your home directory or under `/Users/Shared`.

If you need to create the directory specifically under `/data/db` for MongoDB, you can create it under `/System/Volumes/Data/data/db` instead, which corresponds to the data volume.

Here's how you can do it:

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /System/Volumes/Data/data/db
sudo chown -R `id -un` /System/Volumes/Data/data/db
```

The second command changes the ownership of the directory to the current user, which should allow MongoDB to access it.

Remember to update your MongoDB configuration to use the new path.
