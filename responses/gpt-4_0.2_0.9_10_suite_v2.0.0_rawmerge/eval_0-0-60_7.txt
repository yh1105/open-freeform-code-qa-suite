The error you're encountering is because Bootstrap requires `Popper.js` for the dropdowns and other interactive components. 

To fix this, you need to install `Popper.js` in your project. You can do this by using npm or yarn.

If you're using npm, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm install popper.js --save
```

If you're using yarn, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
yarn add popper.js
```

After installing `Popper.js`, you need to import it in your file before importing Bootstrap. Here's how you can do it:

```javascript
import Popper from 'popper.js';
import 'bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min';
```

The `bootstrap.bundle.min.js` file includes `Popper.js`, so you don't need to worry about importing it separately.

If you're using Bootstrap 4, you can import the bundle file which includes `Popper.js`:

```javascript
import 'bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle';
```

This should resolve the error you're encountering.
