The error message you're seeing is due to a conflict between the Node.js and npm versions installed on your Windows system and those installed in your WSL2 environment. 

When you run `node -v` or `npm -v`, the system is trying to execute the Windows version of these programs, which won't work because of the differences in how Windows and Linux handle executable files.

To solve this issue, you need to remove the Windows PATH from the WSL2 environment and add the correct PATH for the Linux versions of Node.js and npm.

Here are the steps to do this:

1. Open your `.bashrc` file in a text editor. You can do this by running the command `nano ~/.bashrc`.

2. Add the following lines at the end of the file:

    ```bash
    export PATH="$HOME/.npm-global/bin:$PATH"
    export PATH="/usr/bin:$PATH"
    ```

    The first line adds the global npm directory to your PATH, which is where global npm packages are installed. The second line ensures that the system will look in `/usr/bin` for executables, which is where the Linux version of Node.js and npm are installed.

3. Save the file and exit the text editor.

4. Run the command `source ~/.bashrc` to apply the changes.

5. Now, when you run `node -v` and `npm -v`, you should see the versions of Node.js and npm that are installed in your WSL2 environment.
