The error message you're seeing is related to the Groovy VM plugin trying to create a Java 9 VM plugin and failing because it can't find `java.lang.Module`. However, this error message is a debug message and not the cause of your task failure.

The actual issue is likely related to the compatibility of the versions of Kotlin, Gradle, and JaCoCo you're using. 

As of now, JaCoCo version `0.8.6` does not fully support Kotlin `1.5.10` with Gradle `7.0.2`. 

You can try the following solutions:

1. **Downgrade your Kotlin version**: You can try downgrading your Kotlin version to `1.4.32` which is known to work with JaCoCo `0.8.6` and Gradle `7.0.2`.

2. **Use a snapshot version of JaCoCo**: You can try using a snapshot version of JaCoCo that has better support for Kotlin `1.5.10`. For example, you can try using JaCoCo `0.8.7-SNAPSHOT`. However, keep in mind that snapshot versions are not stable and may have other issues.

3. **Wait for a stable release of JaCoCo that supports Kotlin `1.5.10`**: You can monitor the JaCoCo GitHub repository for updates and use a stable release when it becomes available.

Remember to clean and rebuild your project after making these changes.
