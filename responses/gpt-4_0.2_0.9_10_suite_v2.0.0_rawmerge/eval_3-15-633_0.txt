Yes, you can achieve similar functionality using the `INDEX` and `SMALL` functions in combination with `ROW` and `IF` functions. Here's how you can do it:

```excel
=INDEX($B$1:$B$100, SMALL(IF($A$1:$A$100="x", ROW($A$1:$A$100)-ROW(INDEX($A$1:$A$100,1,1))+1), ROW(1:1)))
```

This is an array formula, so you need to press Ctrl+Shift+Enter after typing it, instead of just Enter. 

This formula will return the first match. To get the next matches, you need to drag the formula down.

This formula works by creating an array of row numbers where the condition is met (`$A$1:$A$100="x"`), then using `SMALL` to get the nth smallest value from that array, where n is the current row number (`ROW(1:1)`). `INDEX` then returns the value from column B at that row number.

Remember to adjust the ranges `$B$1:$B$100` and `$A$1:$A$100` to match your actual data.
