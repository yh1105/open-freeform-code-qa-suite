This error is related to the compatibility of IntelliJ IDEA with the Maven version. The version of Maven that comes with Spring Boot 2.7.0 is 3.8.5, which is not yet fully supported by IntelliJ IDEA.

Here are some possible solutions:

1. **Downgrade Maven version**: You can manually downgrade the Maven version in your project to a version that is compatible with your IntelliJ IDEA. You can do this by modifying the `pom.xml` file in your project. Change the Maven version in the properties section to a lower version (e.g., 3.8.4 or lower).

2. **Update IntelliJ IDEA**: JetBrains regularly releases updates for IntelliJ IDEA to support newer versions of Maven. You can check if there is an update available for your IntelliJ IDEA and install it.

3. **Use IntelliJ IDEA's bundled Maven**: IntelliJ IDEA comes with a bundled Maven that is guaranteed to be compatible. You can switch to use the bundled Maven in IntelliJ IDEA settings. Go to `File -> Settings -> Build, Execution, Deployment -> Build Tools -> Maven`. In the `Maven home directory` field, select `Bundled (Maven 3)`.

4. **Use External Maven**: If you have an external Maven installation that is compatible with your IntelliJ IDEA, you can use it instead. In the same settings as above, instead of selecting `Bundled (Maven 3)`, browse to the directory of your external Maven installation.

Remember to re-import your project after changing the Maven version or Maven home directory. You can do this by right-clicking on the `pom.xml` file in your project and selecting `Maven -> Reimport`.
