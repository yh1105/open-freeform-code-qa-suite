The `truncate` class in Tailwind CSS only works for single line text. It sets `overflow: hidden`, `text-overflow: ellipsis`, and `white-space: nowrap`. 

If you want to truncate text that spans multiple lines, you'll need to use a different approach because CSS doesn't natively support multiline text truncation. 

Here is a workaround using line-clamp which is supported in Tailwind CSS v2.0:

```html
<div className="ml-1 inline-block">
   <span>Label: </span>
   <span className="font-semibold line-clamp-1">
     long texttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttt
   </span>
</div>
```

This will limit the text to 1 line. If you want to limit it to 2 lines, you can use `line-clamp-2`, and so on.

Please note that `line-clamp` is not supported in all browsers. It is not supported in IE and has partial support in some other browsers. You can check the compatibility table on [Can I use](https://caniuse.com/?search=line-clamp).
