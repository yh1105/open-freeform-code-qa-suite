In C++, string interpolation isn't as straightforward as in languages like C# or JavaScript. However, you can achieve similar results using `std::stringstream` or the `std::format` function (available from C++20).

Here is an example using `std::stringstream`:

```cpp
#include <sstream>

int myVariable = 5;
std::stringstream ss;
ss << "My variable has value " << myVariable;
std::string result = ss.str();
```

And here is an example using `std::format` (C++20):

```cpp
#include <format>

int myVariable = 5;
std::string result = std::format("My variable has value {}", myVariable);
```

Please note that `std::format` is not yet widely supported by all compilers as of the time of writing.
