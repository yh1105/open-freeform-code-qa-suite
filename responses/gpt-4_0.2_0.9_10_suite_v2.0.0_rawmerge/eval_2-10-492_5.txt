Sure, here is the code snippet with the blanks filled:

```rust
    let ix = anchor_lang::solana_program::system_instruction::transfer(
        from_pubkey, // the sender's public key
        to_pubkey, // the receiver's public key
        amount,
    );
    anchor_lang::solana_program::program::invoke(
        &ix,
        &[
            from_account, // the sender's account info
            to_account, // the receiver's account info
        ],
    );
```

In this code:

- `from_pubkey` is the public key of the sender's account.
- `to_pubkey` is the public key of the receiver's account.
- `amount` is the amount of SOL to be transferred.
- `from_account` is the account info of the sender's account.
- `to_account` is the account info of the receiver's account.

Please replace the placeholders with your actual variables.
