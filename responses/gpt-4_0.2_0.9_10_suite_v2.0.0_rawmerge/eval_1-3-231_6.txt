Sure, you can use the `size()` method of PyTorch tensor to get the shape of each tensor in the list. Here is a function that does this:

```python
def getSize(t):
    sizes = [x.size() for x in t]
    return sizes
```

This function iterates over each tensor in the list `t` and appends its size to the `sizes` list. The `size()` method returns the shape of the tensor as a `torch.Size` object, which is a subclass of Python's tuple.

You can use this function like this:

```python
t = [your list of tensors]
sizes = getSize(t)
print(sizes)
```

This will print a list of shapes for each tensor in your list.
