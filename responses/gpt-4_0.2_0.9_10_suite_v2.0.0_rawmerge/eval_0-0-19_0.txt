The error message indicates that the package `aws-sdk-js` cannot be found in the npm registry. This is because the correct name of the package is `aws-sdk`, not `aws-sdk-js`.

You should run the following command to install the AWS SDK:

```bash
npm install --verbose aws-sdk
```

This will install the AWS SDK for JavaScript in Node.js.
