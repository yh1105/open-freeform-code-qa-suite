The error message is indicating that you are trying to create an index on a navigation property, which is not allowed. In Entity Framework Core, indexes can only be created on scalar properties, not on navigation properties.

You should create an index on the `GenderId` property instead of the `Gender` navigation property. Here is how you can do it:

```c#
protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder modelBuilder)
{
    modelBuilder.Entity<User>(user =>
    {
        user
        .HasOne(x => x.Gender)
        .WithMany(x => x.Users)
        .HasForeignKey(x => x.GenderId);

        user.HasIndex(x => x.GenderId); // Create index on GenderId, not Gender
    });
}
```

Now, when you run the `dotnet ef add migration User` command, it should work without any errors.
