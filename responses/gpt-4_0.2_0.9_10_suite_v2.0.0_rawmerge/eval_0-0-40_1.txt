The error message you're seeing suggests that your shell is trying to execute the Windows version of `npm` instead of the Linux version. This is likely because the Windows path is included in your Linux `$PATH` environment variable.

You can confirm this by running the command `echo $PATH` in your WSL2 terminal. If you see `/mnt/c/Program Files/nodejs/` in the output, that's the cause of the problem.

To solve this issue, you need to remove the Windows path from your Linux `$PATH` environment variable. You can do this by editing your shell's configuration file.

If you're using bash (which seems to be the case), you can edit the `.bashrc` file in your home directory. Open the file with a text editor like `nano`:

```bash
nano ~/.bashrc
```

Then, add the following line at the end of the file:

```bash
export PATH=$(echo "$PATH" | sed -e 's/:\/mnt\/c\/Program Files\/nodejs//')
```

This command removes the `/mnt/c/Program Files/nodejs/` path from the `$PATH` environment variable.

Save the file and exit the text editor. Then, run the following command to apply the changes:

```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```

Now, if you run `npm -v`, it should show the version of the Linux `npm` instead of trying to run the Windows version.
