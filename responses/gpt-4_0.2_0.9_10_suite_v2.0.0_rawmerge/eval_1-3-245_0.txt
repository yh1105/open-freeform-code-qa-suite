The error message `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'app'` is indicating that Python cannot find the module named 'app'. This is likely due to the way your Dockerfile is set up.

Here is a revised version of your Dockerfile:

```Dockerfile
# Use an official Python runtime as a parent image
FROM python:3.8

# Set the working directory in the container to /app
WORKDIR /app

# Add the current directory contents into the container at /app
ADD . /app

# Install any needed packages specified in requirements.txt
COPY requirements.txt /app
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Make port 8000 available to the world outside this container
EXPOSE 8000

# Run the command to start uVicorn server
CMD ["uvicorn", "app.main:app", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "8000", "--reload"]
```

This Dockerfile starts with the Python 3.8 image, sets the working directory to `/app`, and then adds the current directory into the container at `/app`. It then copies the `requirements.txt` file into the container at `/app` and installs any necessary packages using `pip`. It exposes port 8000 and then starts the uVicorn server.

Also, make sure your `docker-compose.yml` file is correctly set up. Here is an example:

```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  web:
    build: .
    command: uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
    volumes:
      - .:/app
    ports:
      - 8000:8000
```

This `docker-compose.yml` file sets up a single service, `web`, builds the Dockerfile in the current directory, and runs the command to start the uVicorn server. It also maps the current directory on the host to `/app` in the container and exposes port 8000.
