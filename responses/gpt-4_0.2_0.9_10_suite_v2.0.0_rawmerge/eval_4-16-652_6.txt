The AWS CLI uses a pager program to handle its output. By default, it uses the `less` program. The pager is activated when the output of a command is too large to fit in one screen.

To disable the pager, you can set the `AWS_PAGER` environment variable to an empty string. You can do this in one of the following ways:

1. **For a single command**, prefix the command with `AWS_PAGER=""`. Here's how you can modify your script:

    ```bash
    for x in 1 2 3; do 
      AWS_PAGER="" aws sqs purge-queue --queue-url https://sqs.<aws-region>.amazonaws.com/<id>/<env>-$x-<queueName>.fifo; 
    done
    ```

2. **For the current shell session**, run this command before running your script:

    ```bash
    export AWS_PAGER=""
    ```

3. **Permanently for all shell sessions**, add the above export command to your shell's profile script (e.g., `~/.bashrc` or `~/.bash_profile` for Bash).

    ```bash
    echo 'export AWS_PAGER=""' >> ~/.bashrc
    ```

    Then, source the profile script or restart your shell to apply the change.

    ```bash
    source ~/.bashrc
    ```

4. **For a specific AWS CLI profile**, add the following lines to the `~/.aws/config` file:

    ```bash
    [profile profilename]
    cli_pager=
    ```

    Replace `profilename` with the name of your AWS CLI profile.

Remember that setting `AWS_PAGER=""` will disable the pager for all AWS CLI commands, not just `aws sqs purge-queue`. If you want to keep the pager for other commands, you should use method 1.
