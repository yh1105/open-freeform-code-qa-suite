You can add your SSH key to Git Bash by using the `ssh-add` command. However, before doing that, you need to start the ssh-agent in the background.

Here are the steps:

1. Start Git Bash.
2. Start the ssh-agent in the background:

```bash
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
```

3. Add your SSH private key to the ssh-agent:

```bash
ssh-add /d/keys/your_key
```

Replace `your_key` with the name of your private key.

Please note that the path to the key file should be in Unix format (`/d/keys/your_key`), not in Windows format (`D:\keys\your_key`). 

If you get an error like "Could not open a connection to your authentication agent" when trying to add the key, it means the ssh-agent is not running. Make sure you've started the ssh-agent before adding the key.
