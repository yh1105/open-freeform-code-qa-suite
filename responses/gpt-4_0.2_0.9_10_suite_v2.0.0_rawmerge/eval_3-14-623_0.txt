This error is quite generic and can be caused by a variety of issues. However, here are a few solutions that have worked for other developers:

1. **Clean the project and delete derived data:**

    - Select `Product -> Clean` from the Xcode menu.
    - Delete derived data. You can do this by going to `Xcode -> Preferences -> Locations -> Derived Data`. Click on the arrow to open the folder in Finder and then delete it.

2. **Check your Swift version:**

    - Make sure that all your pods and your project are using the same Swift version. You can check this by going to `Build Settings -> Swift Compiler - Language -> Swift Language Version`.

3. **Update CocoaPods:**

    - Sometimes, updating CocoaPods can solve the issue. You can do this by running `sudo gem install cocoapods` in your terminal.

4. **Disable parallel builds:**

    - Go to `Xcode -> Preferences -> Locations -> Derived Data -> Advanced...` and select `Build Location: Unique`.
    - Then, uncheck `Build System -> Enable parallelize build`.

5. **Check your code for errors:**

    - Sometimes, the error can be caused by a problem in your code. Check your code for any syntax errors or other issues.

6. **Reinstall Xcode:**

    - If none of the above solutions work, you might want to consider reinstalling Xcode.

Remember to restart Xcode after trying each solution. If the problem persists, you might want to consider contacting Apple support or asking for help on a platform like StackOverflow.
