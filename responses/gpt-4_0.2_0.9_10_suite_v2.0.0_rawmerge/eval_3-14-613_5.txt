This issue can be caused by several factors. Here are some steps you can try to resolve it:

1. **Clean the build folder**: You can do this by going to `Product > Clean Build Folder` or by pressing `Shift + Command + K`.

2. **Delete derived data**: Go to `Xcode > Preferences > Locations > Derived Data`, then delete the derived data folder.

3. **Check your scheme**: Ensure that your scheme is set to the correct target. Go to `Product > Scheme > Edit Scheme` and make sure your target is selected.

4. **Restart Xcode**: Sometimes, simply restarting Xcode can resolve the issue.

5. **Update Xcode**: If you're not on the latest version of Xcode, consider updating. There may be a bug in your current version that's causing the issue.

6. **Check your code**: Make sure there are no errors in your code that could be causing the issue. Even if the code compiles, there may be something that's causing the preview to fail.

If none of these steps work, it could be a bug with Xcode itself. In that case, you might want to consider filing a bug report with Apple.
