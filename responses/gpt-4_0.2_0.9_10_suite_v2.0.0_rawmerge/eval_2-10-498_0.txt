In Rust, the caret operator (`^`) is not used for exponentiation. It is actually a bitwise XOR operator. 

To perform exponentiation in Rust, you can use the `pow` method. Here is an example:

```rust
fn main() {
    let base = 2;
    let exponent = 3;
    let result = base.pow(exponent);
    println!("{}", result);  // Outputs: 8
}
```

In this example, `2.pow(3)` raises `2` to the power of `3`, which results in `8`.

Note that the `pow` method is available for several numeric types in Rust, including `i32`, `f32`, `u32`, etc. The type of the exponent argument is `u32`.
