The `myprogram-0.0.1-plain.jar` is generated by the `bootJar` task in Spring Boot 2.5.0. If you want to disable the generation of this file, you can modify your `build.gradle` file to disable the `bootJar` task:

```groovy
bootJar {
    enabled = false
}
```

This will prevent the generation of the `myprogram-0.0.1-plain.jar` file. However, please note that this file is typically used when you want to run your application without the Spring Boot loader classes. If you disable this task, you won't be able to generate this file when needed.
