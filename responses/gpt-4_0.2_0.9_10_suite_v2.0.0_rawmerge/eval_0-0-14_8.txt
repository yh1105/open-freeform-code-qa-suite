Sure, you can use the `onChange` event of the `Switch` component to update the value of the form field. Here is how you can do it:

```jsx
<Form.Item name="switch" valuePropName="checked">
  <Switch 
    checkedChildren="Yes" 
    unCheckedChildren="No" 
    onChange={(checked) => {
      form.setFieldsValue({ switch: checked });
    }}
  />
  <span>Chargable</span>
</Form.Item>
```

In this code, whenever the switch is toggled, the `onChange` event is triggered, and the new value of the switch is set in the form field named "switch".
