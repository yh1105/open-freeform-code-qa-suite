The `AbstractController::getDoctrine()` method has been deprecated since Symfony 4.2. The alternative is to use dependency injection to get the Doctrine service you need.

For instance, if you need the Doctrine's EntityManager, you can inject it into your controller method like this:

```php
use Doctrine\ORM\EntityManagerInterface;

public function myMethod(EntityManagerInterface $entityManager)
{
    // Now you can use $entityManager as you would use $this->getDoctrine()->getManager()
}
```

Or if you need the repository of an entity, you can inject it directly:

```php
use App\Entity\MyEntity;
use Doctrine\Persistence\ObjectRepository;

public function myMethod(ObjectRepository $myEntityRepository)
{
    // Now you can use $myEntityRepository as you would use $this->getDoctrine()->getRepository(MyEntity::class)
}
```

Remember to configure your services correctly to allow autowiring. You can check the Symfony documentation on how to do this.
