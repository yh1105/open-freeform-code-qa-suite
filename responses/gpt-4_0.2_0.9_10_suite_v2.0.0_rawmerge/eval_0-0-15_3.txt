Sure, the issue is that you're trying to instantiate an object as a class. You should mock the class and its methods like so:

```javascript
import API from 'utils/API';

jest.mock('utils/API', () => {
  return jest.fn().mockImplementation(() => {
    return {someMethod: () => {}};
  });
});
```

In this way, you're mocking the class constructor and the `someMethod` method. Now, you can use `const api = new API()` without any issues.
