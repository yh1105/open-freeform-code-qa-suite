Yes, there is a better way to refactor this code using the `?` operator in Rust. The `?` operator is used for error propagation. When used with `Option<T>`, it will either return the value inside an `Option` if it is `Some`, or it will immediately return `None` from the current function.

Here is how you can refactor your code:

```rust
let i = func1().ok_or_else(|| println!("func 1 returned None"))?;
let j = func2(i).ok_or_else(|| println!("func 2 returned None"))?;
let k = func3(j).ok_or_else(|| println!("func 3 returned None"))?;
let result = func4(k).ok_or_else(|| println!("func 4 returned None"))?;
// Do something with result
```

This code does exactly the same thing as your original code, but it's much more readable and has a flatter structure. Each function is called in a sensible order, and if any function returns `None`, an error message is printed and the function immediately returns.

Please note that this code needs to be inside a function that returns `Option<T>` or `Result<T, E>`. The `?` operator can only be used in functions that return `Result` or `Option` or some other type that implements `std::ops::Try`.
