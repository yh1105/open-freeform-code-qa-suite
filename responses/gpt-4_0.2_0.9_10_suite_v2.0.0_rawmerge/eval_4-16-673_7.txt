The `apt-get` package manager may not have the latest version of cmake. You can download the latest version directly from the cmake website and install it manually. Here are the steps:

1. First, remove the existing cmake:

```bash
sudo apt-get remove cmake
```

2. Download the latest version of cmake from the official website. At the time of writing, the latest version is 3.21.1. Replace `3.21.1` with the latest version number if it's different:

```bash
wget https://github.com/Kitware/CMake/releases/download/v3.21.1/cmake-3.21.1.tar.gz
```

3. Extract the downloaded file:

```bash
tar -xzvf cmake-3.21.1.tar.gz
```

4. Navigate to the extracted directory:

```bash
cd cmake-3.21.1
```

5. Run the bootstrap script:

```bash
./bootstrap
```

6. Compile the source code:

```bash
make
```

7. Install cmake:

```bash
sudo make install
```

8. Verify the installed version:

```bash
cmake --version
```

This should display the version number of cmake that you just installed.
