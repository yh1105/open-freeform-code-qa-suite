In Rust, the caret (`^`) operator is not used for exponentiation. It is actually the bitwise XOR operator.

To raise a number to a power in Rust, you can use the `.pow()` method. Here is an example:

```rust
fn main() {
    let base = 2;
    let exponent = 3;
    let result = base.pow(exponent);
    println!("{}", result);  // Outputs: 8
}
```

In this example, `base.pow(exponent)` raises `base` to the power of `exponent`.

Note that the `.pow()` method is available for several types in Rust, including integers and floating-point numbers. The type of the exponent argument depends on the type of the number you are raising to a power. For integers, it's an `u32`, while for floating-point numbers, it's an `f64`.
