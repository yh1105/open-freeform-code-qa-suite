The error message `Error: Invalid login: 535-5.7.8 Username and Password not accepted` indicates that the username and password you're using to authenticate with the Gmail SMTP server are not correct. 

Here are a few things you can do to resolve this issue:

1. **Check your credentials**: Make sure that the username (email) and password are correct.

2. **Enable Less Secure Apps**: By default, Google blocks attempts from apps it deems less secure from sending emails. You can change this setting from your Google account settings. Here is the link: [Less secure apps](https://myaccount.google.com/lesssecureapps)

3. **Unlock Captcha**: Sometimes, Google may block a login attempt with a new device or location. You can unlock it by visiting this link: [Unlock Captcha](https://accounts.google.com/DisplayUnlockCaptcha)

4. **Use App Password**: If you have 2-Step Verification enabled for your Google account, you may need to use an App Password instead of your regular password. You can generate one from your Google account settings. Here is the link: [App Passwords](https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords)

Remember to replace the `pass` field in your code with the new password or App Password you generated.

```javascript
var transporter = nodemailer.createTransport({
  service: 'gmail',
  auth: {
    user: 'haideryaqoobengr@gmail.com',
    pass: 'your-new-password-or-app-password'
  }
});
```

Please note that it's not a good practice to hard code your credentials in your code. Consider using environment variables or some sort of configuration that is not committed with your code to keep your credentials secure.
