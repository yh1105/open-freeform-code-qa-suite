Sure, you can use the `size()` method provided by PyTorch to get the size of each tensor in the list. Here is a function that does that:

```python
def getSize(t):
    sizes = [tensor.size() for tensor in t]
    return sizes
```

This function iterates over each tensor in the list `t` and appends its size to the `sizes` list. The `sizes` list is then returned. The size of a tensor is a tuple that represents the dimensions of the tensor. For example, a tensor with size `(3, 4)` is a 2-dimensional tensor with 3 rows and 4 columns.
