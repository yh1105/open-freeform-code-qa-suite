The error you're encountering is due to the absence of the `libffi` library on your macOS. You can install it using Homebrew, a package manager for macOS. Here are the steps:

1. If you haven't installed Homebrew yet, you can install it by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

2. Once Homebrew is installed, you can install `libffi` by running:

```bash
brew install libffi
```

3. After installing `libffi`, you need to set the `PKG_CONFIG_PATH` environment variable to the directory where the `libffi.pc` file is located. You can do this by adding the following lines to your shell configuration file (`.bashrc`, `.bash_profile`, or `.zshrc` depending on your shell):

```bash
export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/usr/local/opt/libffi/lib/pkgconfig"
```

4. Source your shell configuration file to apply the changes:

```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```
or
```bash
source ~/.bash_profile
```
or
```bash
source ~/.zshrc
```
depending on which file you added the export line to.

5. Now, you should be able to install `travis`:

```bash
gem install travis
```

Please replace the paths and filenames with your actual paths and filenames if they are different.
