In R, when you bind two data frames with the same column names, R will automatically make the names unique by appending a suffix to the duplicate names. In your case, the two columns will be named `a` and `a.1`.

You can select the second column by its name `a.1` like this:

```r
second_col <- d3$a.1
```

If for some reason the names are not automatically made unique, you can select the second column by its index like this:

```r
second_col <- d3[,2]
```

This will select the second column regardless of its name.
