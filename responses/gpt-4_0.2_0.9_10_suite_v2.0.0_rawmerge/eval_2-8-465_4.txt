The `ext-zip` is a PHP extension, not a Composer package. This means it needs to be installed on your PHP environment, not through Composer. 

The error message you're seeing is because Composer is trying to find a package named `ext-zip`, but it doesn't exist.

Here's how you can install the `ext-zip` extension:

**For Ubuntu/Debian**

You can install it via `apt-get`:

```bash
sudo apt-get install php-zip
```

**For CentOS/RHEL**

You can install it via `yum`:

```bash
sudo yum install php-pecl-zip
```

**For Windows**

1. Find your `php.ini` file (you can check where it is from `phpinfo();`).
2. Open that file in a text editor.
3. Search for `extension=php_zip.dll`.
4. If this line is present, but commented out (i.e., preceded by a `;`), then remove the `;` to enable the extension.
5. If this line is not present, add it yourself.
6. Save `php.ini` and restart your web server.

**For MacOS**

You can install it via `pecl`:

```bash
pecl install zip
```

After installing the extension, you can add it to your `composer.json` file like this:

```json
{
    "require": {
        "php": "^7.1",
        "ext-zip": "*"
    }
}
```

This won't actually install `ext-zip` (because it's not a Composer package), but it will make Composer check if the extension is installed when you run `composer install`. This is useful if other people are going to be running your code on their own machines, because it will remind them to install the `ext-zip` extension if they haven't already.
