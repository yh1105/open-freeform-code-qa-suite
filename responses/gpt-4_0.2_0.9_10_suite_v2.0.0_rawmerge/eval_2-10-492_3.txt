In your case, the `transfer` function requires the sender's public key and the receiver's public key. The `invoke` function requires the instruction and the accounts involved in the transaction. Here's how you can fill in the blanks:

```rust
    let ix = anchor_lang::solana_program::system_instruction::transfer(
        &sender_pubkey,
        &event_vault_address,
        amount,
    );
    anchor_lang::solana_program::program::invoke(
        &ix,
        &[
            sender_account_info.clone(),
            event_vault_account_info.clone(),
        ],
    );
```

In this code:

- `sender_pubkey` is the public key of the sender's account.
- `event_vault_address` is the public key of the event account's vault.
- `amount` is the amount of SOL to be transferred.
- `sender_account_info` is the account info of the sender's account.
- `event_vault_account_info` is the account info of the event account's vault.

Please replace these placeholders with your actual variables.
