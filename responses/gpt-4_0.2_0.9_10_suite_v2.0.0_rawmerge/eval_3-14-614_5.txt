There could be several reasons why the SwiftUI preview is not showing in Xcode 11. Here are some common solutions:

1. **Check your macOS and Xcode versions:** SwiftUI requires macOS Catalina and Xcode 11. Make sure you're running the appropriate versions.

2. **Check your SwiftUI code:** Make sure your SwiftUI code doesn't have any errors. Even a small error can prevent the preview from showing.

3. **Try restarting Xcode:** Sometimes, Xcode might just need a restart to function properly.

4. **Try cleaning the build folder:** You can do this by going to `Product > Clean Build Folder` or by pressing `Shift + Command + K`.

5. **Check if you're in the correct editor mode:** Make sure you're in the correct editor mode to see the SwiftUI preview. You can do this by going to `View > Editor > Canvas` or by pressing `Option + Command + Return`.

6. **Try manually refreshing the preview:** You can do this by pressing `Option + Command + P`.

7. **Check your device and OS in the preview:** Make sure you're previewing for a device and OS that supports SwiftUI.

8. **Check your `ContentView_Previews` struct:** Make sure your `ContentView_Previews` struct is correct. It should look something like this:

```swift
#if DEBUG
struct ContentView_Previews: PreviewProvider {
    static var previews: some View {
        ContentView()
    }
}
#endif
```

If none of these solutions work, there might be a problem with your Xcode installation. You might want to consider reinstalling Xcode.
