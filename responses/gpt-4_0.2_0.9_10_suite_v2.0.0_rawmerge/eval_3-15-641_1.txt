It seems like you're trying to find a way to get the local path of a file that's synced with OneDrive/SharePoint in Excel VBA. Unfortunately, Excel VBA doesn't have a built-in function to retrieve the local path of a file that's synced with OneDrive/SharePoint. 

However, you can use the `Environ` function to get the local OneDrive path, and then append the relative path of your file to it. Here's a simple example:

```vba
Sub GetOneDrivePath()

    Dim OneDrivePath As String
    Dim FilePath As String

    ' Get the local OneDrive path
    OneDrivePath = Environ("OneDrive")

    ' Append the relative path of your file
    FilePath = OneDrivePath & "\path\to\your\file"

    ' Print the local path of the file
    Debug.Print FilePath

End Sub
```

Please replace `"\path\to\your\file"` with the relative path of your file. Note that this method assumes that the user has the same relative path in their local OneDrive folder.

If the users sync folders at different levels, you might need to create a more complex function that searches for the folder in the OneDrive directory. This could potentially be slow, as you've mentioned.

As for the "Open File Location" button, it's a feature of the Excel interface and its functionality can't be accessed directly through VBA.
