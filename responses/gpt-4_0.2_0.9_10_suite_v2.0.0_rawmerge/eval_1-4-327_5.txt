In R, you cannot have two columns with the same name in a data frame. When you bind two data frames with the same column names using `cbind()`, R will automatically make the column names unique by adding a suffix to the duplicate names.

In your case, the column names of `d3` will be `a` and `a.1`. You can select the second column by its name `a.1`:

```r
second_col <- d3$a.1
```

If you still want to select the second column by the original name `a`, you can use the column index instead:

```r
second_col <- d3[,2]
```

This will select the second column regardless of its name.
