It seems like you are missing the `libffi` library which is a dependency for the `travis-cli` gem. You can install it using Homebrew.

Here are the steps to install `libffi`:

1. If you don't have Homebrew installed, install it first:

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

2. Install `libffi`:

```bash
brew install libffi
```

3. After installation, you might need to add the `libffi` library path to your `PKG_CONFIG_PATH` environment variable. You can do this by adding the following line to your shell configuration file (`.bashrc`, `.bash_profile`, or `.zshrc`):

```bash
export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/usr/local/opt/libffi/lib/pkgconfig"
```

4. Source your shell configuration file to apply the changes:

```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```

Or, if you're using Zsh:

```bash
source ~/.zshrc
```

5. Now, you should be able to install the `travis-cli` gem:

```bash
gem install travis
```

Please replace the shell configuration file with the one you are using. If you are using a different shell, the file will be different (e.g., `.bashrc`, `.bash_profile`, `.zshrc`, etc.).
