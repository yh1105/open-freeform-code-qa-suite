The error you're seeing is due to a change in Android 12 (API level 31) that requires you to specify whether a `PendingIntent` is mutable or immutable when you create it. 

The `MediaSessionCompat` class in the AndroidX Media library version 1.4.0 has already been updated to handle this change. However, it seems like you're still getting the error.

This could be due to one of the following reasons:

1. You might be using an older version of the AndroidX Media library in another part of your code. Make sure all instances of the library are updated to version 1.4.0.

2. There might be another library in your project that is creating a `PendingIntent` without specifying the mutability. Check your dependencies and make sure they are all updated to versions that support Android 12.

3. You might be creating a `PendingIntent` in your own code without specifying the mutability. If this is the case, you need to update your code to specify the mutability when creating the `PendingIntent`.

Here is an example of how to create a `PendingIntent` that is immutable:

```kotlin
val intent = Intent(this, MyBroadcastReceiver::class.java)
val pendingIntent: PendingIntent
if (Build.VERSION.SDK_INT >= Build.VERSION_CODES.M) {
    pendingIntent = PendingIntent.getBroadcast(this, 0, intent, PendingIntent.FLAG_IMMUTABLE or PendingIntent.FLAG_UPDATE_CURRENT)
} else {
    pendingIntent = PendingIntent.getBroadcast(this, 0, intent, PendingIntent.FLAG_UPDATE_CURRENT)
}
```

In this example, the `PendingIntent` is created with the `FLAG_IMMUTABLE` flag if the Android version is 6.0 (Marshmallow) or higher. For lower versions, the `PendingIntent` is created without the `FLAG_IMMUTABLE` flag.
