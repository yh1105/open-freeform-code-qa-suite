This error can occur due to a variety of reasons. Here are a few solutions you can try:

1. **Check your code signing settings**: Make sure you have the correct provisioning profiles selected for your target under "Build Settings" > "Signing" > "Code Signing Identity". Also, ensure that your provisioning profile is valid and not expired.

2. **Check your podfile**: Make sure all the pods are installed correctly. Try to deintegrate the pods using `pod deintegrate` and then install them again using `pod install`.

3. **Check your script phases**: If you have any scripts in the "Build Phases" section of your target, make sure they are correct and not causing the error.

4. **Check your Swift version**: If you are using a library that is not compatible with your Swift version, it can cause this error. Make sure all your libraries are compatible with your Swift version.

5. **Clean and rebuild your project**: Sometimes, simply cleaning the project and rebuilding it can solve the problem. You can clean the project by going to "Product" > "Clean Build Folder" in Xcode.

6. **Delete derived data**: You mentioned that you already did this, but it's worth mentioning again. You can delete derived data by going to "Preferences" > "Locations" > "Derived Data" in Xcode, then click on the arrow to open the folder in Finder and move it to the trash.

7. **Check your disk space**: If your disk is full, it can cause this error. Make sure you have enough free space on your disk.

8. **Check your Xcode version**: Make sure you are using the latest version of Xcode. If not, update it.

If none of these solutions work, you might need to provide more information or the exact error message you are getting for further assistance.
