The error message you're seeing, `NoReverseMatch`, is raised by Django when it is unable to match a URL pattern for a view. In your case, it's failing to find a match for the 'profile' view with the arguments you're providing.

The error message is indicating that the argument being passed to the 'profile' URL pattern is an empty string. This is likely because `post.author.username` is empty or `None` for at least one of your `NewPost` instances.

In your `index.html` template, you have the following line:

```html
<a href="{% url 'profile' post.author.username %}">
```

This line is trying to generate a URL for the 'profile' view, passing `post.author.username` as an argument. If `post.author.username` is empty or `None`, Django will not be able to match the URL pattern and will raise a `NoReverseMatch` error.

To fix this, you need to ensure that `post.author.username` is not empty or `None` for any of your `NewPost` instances. You can do this by adding a check in your template like so:

```html
{% for post in posts %}
    <div class="card">
        <div class="card-body"> Title: {{post.title}} </div>
        <div class="card-body"> Description: {{post.description}}</div>
        {% if post.author.username %}
            <p> {{post.author.username}} </p>
            <div class="card-body">
                <a href="{% url 'profile' post.author.username %}">
                    @{{post.author.username}}
                </a>
            </div>
        {% endif %}
    </div>
{% endfor %}
```

This will only generate the link if `post.author.username` is not empty.
