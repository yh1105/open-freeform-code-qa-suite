The error message indicates that your app isn't using AndroidX, which is the open-source project used by the Android team to develop, test, package, version and release libraries within Jetpack.

AndroidX is a major improvement to the original Android Support Library, which is no longer maintained. It provides parity across Android releases, and means that you only need to manage a single version of the support library.

To migrate your app to AndroidX, you can follow these steps:

1. Backup your project.
2. Update your `android/gradle.properties` file and add the following lines:

    ```markdown
    android.useAndroidX=true
    android.enableJetifier=true
    ```

3. Update your `compileSdkVersion` to 28 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file.

    ```markdown
    android {
        compileSdkVersion 28

        ...
    }
    ```

4. Update your dependencies in your `pubspec.yaml` file to the AndroidX equivalents. You can find the AndroidX equivalents of common libraries [here](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/migrate).

5. Run `flutter clean` to clean your project.
6. Finally, run `flutter pub get` to fetch the packages.

After you've migrated your app to AndroidX, you should be able to generate the Android project and its APK without any issues.

If you still encounter the error, it might be due to a problem with your Gradle configuration. You can try to delete the `android/.gradle` directory and rebuild your project.
