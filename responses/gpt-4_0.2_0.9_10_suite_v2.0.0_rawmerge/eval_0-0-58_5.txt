The `EINTEGRITY` error is a checksum error that occurs when the `npm` client verifies the integrity of the downloaded packages. The error message indicates that the checksum of the downloaded package does not match the expected checksum.

Here are some possible solutions to resolve this issue:

1. **Clear the npm cache:** The package might have been corrupted during download. Clearing the npm cache forces npm to download the package again. You can clear the npm cache with the following command:

```bash
npm cache clean --force
```

2. **Delete the `node_modules` directory and `package-lock.json` file:** Sometimes, the `node_modules` directory or the `package-lock.json` file might be causing the issue. You can delete them with the following commands:

```bash
rm -rf node_modules
rm package-lock.json
```

Then, try to install the packages again with `npm install`.

3. **Update npm:** The issue might be caused by a bug in the npm client. Updating npm to the latest version might resolve the issue. You can update npm with the following command:

```bash
npm install -g npm@latest
```

4. **Use a different package registry:** The issue might be caused by the npm registry. You can try using a different package registry, such as Yarn or cnpm.

5. **Check your network connection:** A poor network connection might cause the package to be corrupted during download. If possible, try to install the packages on a different network.

Remember to always backup your project before making any changes.
