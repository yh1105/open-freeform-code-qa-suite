The issue you're experiencing is likely due to Vite's server not being accessible from outside the Docker container. By default, Vite's server only listens to `localhost`, which means it's not accessible from outside the container.

To fix this, you need to change the `host` option in the Vite configuration to `0.0.0.0` which will make the server accessible from any network interface.

Here's how you can do it:

```typescript
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import vue from '@vitejs/plugin-vue'

// https://vitejs.dev/config/
export default defineConfig({
    resolve: { alias: { '@': '/src' } },
    plugins: [vue()],
    server: {
        host: '0.0.0.0', // Add this line
        port: 8080
    }
})
```

This should make your Vite server accessible from outside the Docker container.
