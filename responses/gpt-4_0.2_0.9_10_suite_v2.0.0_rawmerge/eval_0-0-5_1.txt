The error message indicates that Python is not found in your PATH. Node-gyp, which is a part of the build process, requires Python to be installed and accessible.

Here are the steps to fix this issue:

1. Install Python 2.7.x from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Node-gyp does not work with Python 3.x, so make sure to install a 2.7.x version.

2. During the installation, check the box that says "Add Python.exe to Path". This will allow the system to find Python from any command prompt.

3. After the installation, open a new command prompt and type `python --version`. This should return the Python version if it was installed correctly.

4. If Python is installed and accessible, try to rebuild your project.

If you have already installed Python and it's still not recognized, you might need to manually add it to your system PATH. Here's how to do it:

1. Open System Properties (Right click Computer in the start menu, or use the keyboard shortcut Win+Pause)

2. Click Advanced system settings in the sidebar.

3. Click Environment Variables....

4. Select PATH in the System variables section

5. Click Edit

6. Add Python's path to the end of the list (the paths are separated by semicolons). For example:
   ```
   C:\Program Files\Some Other App;C:\Python27
   ```
7. Click OK

8. Open a new command prompt and type `python --version` to verify the installation.

Remember to replace `C:\Python27` with your actual Python installation path.
