The error message you're seeing is due to the way the command is being parsed. It's having trouble with the embedded quotes in the command.

Here's a possible solution:

1. Open the `mvn.cmd` file in a text editor. You can find this file at the path `C:\Program Files\NetBeans-11.1\netbeans\java\maven\bin\`.

2. Look for a line that starts with `set MAVEN_CMD_LINE_ARGS=`. This line is setting the command line arguments for Maven, and it's where the problem is occurring.

3. Change this line to `set "MAVEN_CMD_LINE_ARGS=%*"`.

4. Save and close the file.

This change should fix the problem with the embedded quotes. Now, when you try to build your project, it should work correctly.

If the problem persists, please check your environment variables, especially `JAVA_HOME` and `PATH`. Make sure they are set correctly and pointing to the correct locations. 

Also, ensure that you have the necessary permissions to run the `cmd` command and to access the directories and files involved in the build process.
