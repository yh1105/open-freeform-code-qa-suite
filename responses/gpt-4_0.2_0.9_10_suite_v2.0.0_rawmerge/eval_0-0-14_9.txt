The code you provided seems correct. However, if you're having issues with the `onCreate` function not receiving the switch value, it might be due to the `noStyle` prop. The `noStyle` prop should not affect the form data, but it might be causing some issues.

Here's the revised version of your code:

```jsx
<Form.Item name="switch" valuePropName="checked">
    <Switch checkedChildren="Yes" unCheckedChildren="No" />
    <span>Chargable</span>
</Form.Item>
```

If you still have issues, please ensure that the `onCreate` function is correctly implemented and is able to receive and handle the form values.
