The problem you're experiencing is due to a conflict between the Node.js and npm installed in your WSL2 Ubuntu and the Node.js and npm installed in your Windows 10.

When you run `node -v` or `npm -v`, the system will look for the `node` or `npm` command in the directories listed in your `PATH` environment variable, in the order they are listed. It seems that the `/mnt/c/Program Files/nodejs` directory (which contains the Windows version of Node.js and npm) is listed before `/usr/bin` (which contains the WSL2 Ubuntu version) in your `PATH`.

To solve this issue, you can modify your `PATH` to prioritize the Ubuntu version of Node.js and npm. Here's how:

1. Open your `.bashrc` file in a text editor. You can use `nano` for this:

   ```bash
   nano ~/.bashrc
   ```

2. Add the following line to the end of the file:

   ```bash
   export PATH="/usr/bin:$PATH"
   ```

   This line prepends `/usr/bin` to your `PATH`, so the system will look for commands in `/usr/bin` before it looks in any other directory.

3. Save the file and exit the text editor. If you're using `nano`, you can do this by pressing `Ctrl+X`, then `Y`, then `Enter`.

4. Close your terminal and open a new one, or source your `.bashrc` file to apply the changes immediately:

   ```bash
   source ~/.bashrc
   ```

5. Now, when you run `node -v` or `npm -v`, you should see the version of Node.js and npm installed in your WSL2 Ubuntu.
