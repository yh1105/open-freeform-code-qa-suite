This issue might be due to the SwiftUI Preview not being associated with a target. Here's how you can fix it:

1. Select the file that contains your `ContentView_Previews`.
2. In the File Inspector (the first tab in the right sidebar), under the "Target Membership" section, make sure your app's target is checked.

If this doesn't work, try the following:

1. Clean your build folder (Product -> Clean Build Folder).
2. Quit Xcode.
3. Delete derived data (you can find the path in Xcode -> Preferences -> Locations).
4. Restart your Mac.
5. Open your project and try again.

If none of these work, it might be an Xcode bug. You can report it to Apple via their Feedback Assistant.
