The "CSRF token mismatch" error usually occurs when the application is unable to verify the CSRF token that comes with the request. This could be due to several reasons, including:

1. **Session Configuration**: Check your session configuration in the `.env` file. Make sure that the `SESSION_DOMAIN` is set correctly. It should match the domain of your application. If your application is on `www.example.com`, then `SESSION_DOMAIN` should be `.example.com`.

2. **Cookie Configuration**: Check your cookie configuration in the `config/session.php` file. Make sure that the `secure` option is set to `true` if you are using HTTPS, and `false` if you are using HTTP.

3. **Middleware**: Ensure that the `VerifyCsrfToken` middleware is included in the `web` middleware group in your `app/Http/Kernel.php` file.

4. **Cache**: Try clearing your application cache using the command `php artisan config:cache`.

5. **Browser Cookies**: Clear your browser cookies. Old cookies might be causing the issue.

6. **Server Configuration**: If you are using a load balancer or a proxy server, make sure that the sessions are being handled correctly. The server should be configured to always direct a user to the same instance of the application once a session has been established.

7. **File Permissions**: Check the permissions of the `storage/framework/sessions` directory. Laravel needs to be able to read and write to this directory. The correct permissions are usually `755` for directories and `644` for files.

Remember to always backup your files before making any changes.
