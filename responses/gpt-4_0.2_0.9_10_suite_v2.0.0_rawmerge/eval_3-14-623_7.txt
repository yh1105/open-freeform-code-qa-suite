This issue can be caused by a variety of factors. Here are some potential solutions you can try:

1. **Clean the project**: In Xcode, select `Product > Clean Build Folder`. If that doesn't work, try `Product > Clean`.

2. **Delete derived data**: Go to `Window > Organizer > Projects`, select your project, and click `Delete` next to `Derived Data`.

3. **Update CocoaPods**: If you're using CocoaPods, make sure you're using the latest version. You can update CocoaPods by running `sudo gem install cocoapods` in Terminal.

4. **Update your pods**: Run `pod update` in Terminal to update your pods to the latest versions.

5. **Check your Swift version**: Make sure your project is using the correct Swift version. You can check this in `Build Settings > Swift Compiler - Language > Swift Language Version`.

6. **Reinstall Xcode**: If all else fails, you might want to try reinstalling Xcode.

Remember to close Xcode before running any Terminal commands, and reopen it afterwards. If you're still having issues, it might be a problem with one of your pods. Try removing them one by one to see if you can isolate the issue.
