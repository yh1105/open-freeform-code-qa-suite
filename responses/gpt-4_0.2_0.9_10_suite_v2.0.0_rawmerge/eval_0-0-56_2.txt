The issue you're experiencing is likely due to Vite's server only listening on the `localhost` interface inside the Docker container. This means that it's not accessible from outside the container, even though the port is exposed.

To fix this, you need to configure Vite to listen on all interfaces. You can do this by setting the `host` option to `0.0.0.0` in your `vite.config.ts` file:

```typescript
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import vue from '@vitejs/plugin-vue'

// https://vitejs.dev/config/
export default defineConfig({
    resolve: { alias: { '@': '/src' } },
    plugins: [vue()],
    server: {
        host: '0.0.0.0',
        port: 8080
    }
})
```

This tells Vite to listen on all network interfaces, making the server accessible from outside the Docker container. Now, you should be able to access your Vite server from your host machine at `localhost:8080`.
