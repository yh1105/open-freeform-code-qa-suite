In Rust, `Box<T>` is a smart pointer that points to data on the heap. It's important to note that Rust doesn't use null pointers like C++ or other languages. Instead, Rust uses the `Option<T>` type to express the possibility of absence.

So, if you want to express that a `Node` might not exist, you should use `Option<Box<Node>>` instead of `Box<Node>`. Here's how you can modify your code:

```rust
struct Node {
    value: i32,
    next: Option<Box<Node>>,
}

struct Stack {
    top: Option<Box<Node>>,
}
```

Now, `top` and `next` can be `None`, which is equivalent to a null pointer in other languages. You can check if `top` or `next` is `None` (null) like this:

```rust
if let Some(node) = &stack.top {
    // top is not null
} else {
    // top is null
}
```

Or using `is_none()` and `is_some()` methods:

```rust
if stack.top.is_some() {
    // top is not null
} else if stack.top.is_none() {
    // top is null
}
```

Remember to initialize `top` as `None` in the `Stack`:

```rust
struct Stack {
    top: Option<Box<Node>>,
}

impl Stack {
    fn new() -> Stack {
        Stack { top: None }
    }
}
```
