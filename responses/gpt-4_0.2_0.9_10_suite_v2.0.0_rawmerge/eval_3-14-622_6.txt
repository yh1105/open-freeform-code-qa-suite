To conform to `ShapeStyle` protocol, you need to implement the `func _apply(to shape: inout _ShapeStyle_ShapeType)` method. Here's how you can do it:

```swift
struct MyContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        Circle()
            .fill(RedShapeStyle())
    }
}

struct RedShapeStyle: ShapeStyle {
    func _apply(to shape: inout _ShapeStyle_ShapeType) {
        shape.fill = Color.red._apply(to:)
    }
}
```

Please note that `_ShapeStyle_ShapeType` and `_apply(to:)` are underscored because they are private APIs, which means they are not intended for public use and may change in future versions of SwiftUI. It's generally not recommended to use private APIs in production code. 

In your case, it's better to use `Color.red` directly or create a custom `Color` extension if you need a specific color frequently.
