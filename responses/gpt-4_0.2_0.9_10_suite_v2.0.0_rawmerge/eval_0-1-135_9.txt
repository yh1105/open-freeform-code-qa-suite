This is a known issue with Safari and flexbox. The `height: auto` is not working as expected due to a bug in Safari's implementation of flexbox.

To fix this, you can use `align-self: flex-start` on the image. This will align the image at the start of the cross axis, and prevent it from stretching.

```css
.container img {
  width: 125px;
  height: auto;
  align-self: flex-start;
}
```

This should make your images display as expected in Safari.
