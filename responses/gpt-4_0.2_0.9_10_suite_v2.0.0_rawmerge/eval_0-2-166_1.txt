Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs. It doesn't provide a direct way to target child elements like you would do in traditional CSS. Tailwind CSS is more about applying styles directly to the elements you want to style.

However, you can use the `@apply` directive in your CSS to apply a set of styles to a specific selector. Here's an example:

```css
div.section > div {
  @apply bg-red-500 text-white;
}
```

In this example, direct children `div` elements of `div` with class `section` will have a red background and white text.

Remember to enable this feature in your Tailwind CSS configuration file (`tailwind.config.js`) if it's not enabled:

```js
module.exports = {
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  variants: {},
  plugins: [],
  corePlugins: {
    preflight: true,
  },
}
```

The `preflight` option includes Normalize.css and additional base styles for a modern, consistent, and flexible browser styling reset. 

Please note that using `@apply` is not the "utility-first" way of doing things in Tailwind and should be used sparingly. The utility-first approach encourages you to use utility classes directly in your HTML.
