You can use the Tailwind CSS utility classes to apply a border to the top only. The `border-t` class applies a border to the top edge of an element. The `border-blue-900` class applies a blue color to the border. 

Here is how you can modify your code:

```html
<div class="border-t border-blue-900">foo</div>
```

This will apply a border only to the top edge of the div.
