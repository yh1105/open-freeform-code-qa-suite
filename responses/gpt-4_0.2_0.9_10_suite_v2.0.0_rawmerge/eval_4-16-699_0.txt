The `lastIndexOf` method will return the last index of the specified string, which is not what you want in this case. Instead, you should use the `indexOf` method to get the first occurrence of "-354" in the string. 

However, `indexOf` will return the index where "-354" starts. You want to keep "-354" in your output, so you should add 4 to the index (since "-354" has 4 characters).

Here is the corrected code:

```powershell
$FileArray = @("Name1-354-03.pdf", "Name23-354-H11.pdf", "Name354-354-02.pdf", "Name3545-354.pdf")
ForEach ($n in $FileArray){
     $index = $n.indexOf('-354')
     if ($index -ne -1) {
         Write-Host $n.Substring(0, $index+4)
     }
}
```

This script will output:

```
Name1-354
Name23-354
Name354-354
Name3545-354
```

This code will check if "-354" is found in the string (`$index -ne -1`). If it is found, it will print the substring from the start of the string to the end of "-354". If "-354" is not found, it will not print anything.
