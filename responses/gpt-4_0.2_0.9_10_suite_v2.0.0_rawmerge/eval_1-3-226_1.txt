Sure, you can achieve this by using the `split()` function with a maximum split parameter of 1. This will split the string into two parts at most. If the string doesn't contain `_`, it will return the original string. Here is the function:

```python
def splitOne(s):
    return s.split('_', 1)[-1]
```

This function works as follows:

- The `split('_', 1)` function splits the string at the first occurrence of `_` and returns a list of at most two elements.
- If the string doesn't contain `_`, the `split()` function returns a list containing the original string.
- The `[-1]` index returns the last element of the list, which is the part of the string after the first `_` if it exists, or the original string if it doesn't.
