The `@State` property wrapper is designed to be used and modified within the view's body or methods called from it. You can't set its value in the `init` method. 

However, you can use a workaround by using a `@StateObject` or `@ObservedObject`:

```swift
class StateFromOutsideModel: ObservableObject {
    @Published var fullText: String

    init(letter: String) {
        self.fullText = list[letter]!
    }
}

struct StateFromOutside: View {
    let list = [
        "a": "Letter A",
        "b": "Letter B",
        // ...
    ]

    @StateObject var model: StateFromOutsideModel

    init(letter: String) {
        _model = StateObject(wrappedValue: StateFromOutsideModel(letter: list[letter]!))
    }

    var body: some View {
        TextField("Placeholder", text: $model.fullText)
    }
}
```

In this code, `StateFromOutsideModel` is an `ObservableObject` that holds the `fullText` state. It is initialized with the desired value in the `StateFromOutside` view's `init` method.
