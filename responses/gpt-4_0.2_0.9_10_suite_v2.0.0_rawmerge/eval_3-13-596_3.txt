The `myprogram-0.0.1-plain.jar` is generated by the `bootJar` task of the Spring Boot Gradle plugin. This is a feature of Spring Boot 2.5.0 and later versions. The `*-plain.jar` is a jar file that can be run independently of Spring Boot.

If you want to disable the generation of the `*-plain.jar` file, you can configure the `bootJar` task in your `build.gradle` file as follows:

```groovy
bootJar {
    enabled = false
}
```

This will prevent the `bootJar` task from running, and thus the `*-plain.jar` file will not be generated. However, please note that this will also disable the generation of the executable `*.jar` file. If you want to keep the executable `*.jar` file, you should not disable the `bootJar` task.

As of now, there is no direct way to disable only the `*-plain.jar` file generation. If you really don't want this file, you could add a task to delete it after the build:

```groovy
task deletePlainJar(type: Delete) {
    delete "${buildDir}/libs/myprogram-${version}-plain.jar"
}

build.finalizedBy(deletePlainJar)
```

This will delete the `*-plain.jar` file after the build is completed.
