You can use the `groupby` method in pandas to group by column 'A' and then use the `idxmin` function to find the index of the minimum value in column 'B'. Then, use `loc` to select these rows. Here is the function:

```python
def getMin(df):
    return df.loc[df.groupby('A')['B'].idxmin()]
```

This function works as follows:

1. `df.groupby('A')['B'].idxmin()` groups the DataFrame by column 'A' and finds the index of the minimum value in column 'B' for each group.
2. `df.loc[...]` selects the rows with these indices from the original DataFrame.

So, if you use this function with your DataFrame, it will return the rows with the minimum 'B' value for each 'A' value.
