The error message you're seeing usually indicates that the response from the server is not a valid JSON string. 

Here are a few things you can do to debug and solve this issue:

1. **Print the response body**: Before trying to decode the response, print it to the console. This will help you see exactly what you're trying to decode.

```dart
print('Response body: ${response.body}');
```

2. **Check the server-side script**: Make sure that the PHP script is correctly outputting a JSON string. You can test this by accessing the URL in a web browser or using a tool like Postman.

3. **Check the response status code**: Before decoding the response, check the HTTP status code. If it's not 200, there might be an error on the server side.

```dart
if (response.statusCode == 200) {
  List data = json.decode(response.body);
} else {
  print('Request failed with status: ${response.statusCode}.');
}
```

4. **Handle exceptions**: Wrap the decoding in a try-catch block to handle any exceptions that might occur.

```dart
try {
  List data = json.decode(response.body);
} catch (e) {
  print('Error: $e');
}
```

By following these steps, you should be able to identify and fix the problem.
