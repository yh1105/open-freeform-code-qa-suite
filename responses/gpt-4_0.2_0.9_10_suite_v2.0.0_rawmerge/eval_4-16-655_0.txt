GitLab CI/CD doesn't support nested variable expansion in the `variables` section of the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file. This is a limitation of GitLab CI/CD itself, not the `bash` runner.

You can work around this limitation by moving the variable expansion into the `script` section of your job:

```yaml
job1:
  script:
    - export GIT_BRANCH="${CI_MERGE_REQUEST_SOURCE_BRANCH_NAME:-${CI_COMMIT_BRANCH:-$CI_DEFAULT_BRANCH}}"
    - echo $GIT_BRANCH
```

In this case, the variable `GIT_BRANCH` is defined and expanded within the context of the `bash` shell, which does support nested variable expansion.
