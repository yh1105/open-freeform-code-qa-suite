Sure, you can use the `keydown` event to listen for the "enter" key. Here's how you can modify your code:

```javascript
mounted() {
  let editor = new Editor({
    extensions: [
      StarterKit,
      Keymap({
        "Enter": ({ state, dispatch }) => {
          console.log("good");
          // Prevent default "Enter" behavior
          return true;
        }
      })
    ],
    content: this.value
  });
  this.editor = editor;
}
```

In this code, we're adding a new keymap extension that listens for the "Enter" key. When the "Enter" key is pressed, it logs "good" to the console and prevents the default "Enter" behavior. 

Please note that you need to import `Keymap` from `prosemirror-commands` to use it.
