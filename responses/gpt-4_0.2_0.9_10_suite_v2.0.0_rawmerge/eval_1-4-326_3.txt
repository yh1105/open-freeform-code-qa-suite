You can use the `gsub` function in R to replace the commas inside the quotes. Here is the function `removeComma`:

```r
removeComma <- function(s) {
  # This regular expression matches a comma that is inside quotes
  # The lookahead (?=.*\") checks that there is a quote somewhere after the comma
  # The lookbehind (?<=\") checks that there is a quote somewhere before the comma
  regex <- ",(?=.*\")(.*\")"
  
  # Replace the matched commas with a space
  s <- gsub(regex, " ", s)
  
  return(s)
}
```

This function uses a regular expression to match commas that are inside quotes, and then replaces them with a space. The lookahead and lookbehind are used to ensure that the comma is inside quotes. The lookahead checks that there is a quote somewhere after the comma, and the lookbehind checks that there is a quote somewhere before the comma.

You can use this function like this:

```r
string <- c("1, 2, \"something, else\"", "3, 5, \"more, more, more\"", "6, \"commas, are fun\", \"no, they are not\"")
removeComma(string)
```

This will return:

```r
[1] "1, 2, \"something else\""                  
[2] "3, 5, \"more more more\""                  
[3] "6, \"commas are fun\", \"no they are not\""
```
