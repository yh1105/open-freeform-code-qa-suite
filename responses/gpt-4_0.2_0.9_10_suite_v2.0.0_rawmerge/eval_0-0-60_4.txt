The error you're seeing is because Bootstrap requires `popper.js` for tooltips, popovers, and dropdowns. You can fix this issue by installing `popper.js` in your project.

Here are the steps to install `popper.js`:

1. Install `popper.js` via npm:

```bash
npm install popper.js --save
```

2. After installing `popper.js`, you need to import it in your file where you're using Bootstrap:

```javascript
import Popper from 'popper.js';
import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css';
import 'bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.min.js';
```

3. If you're using Webpack, you can add the following plugins to your webpack configuration file:

```javascript
plugins: [
    new webpack.ProvidePlugin({
        $: 'jquery',
        jQuery: 'jquery',
        'window.jQuery': 'jquery',
        Popper: ['popper.js', 'default'],
    })
]
```

This will automatically load `$` and `jQuery` whenever it's used in your application, so you don't have to import it in every file.

Remember to restart your server after these changes. If the problem persists, try deleting the `node_modules` folder and `package-lock.json` file, then run `npm install` again.
