The error message you're seeing is due to a change in the `pandas.concat` function in pandas 1.0.0. The `join_axes` argument was removed, which is causing the `TypeError` you're seeing.

The `pandas_profiling` library you're using hasn't been updated to reflect this change in pandas. You can solve this problem by downgrading your pandas version to a version that still supports the `join_axes` argument. 

You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
conda install pandas=0.25.3
```

Alternatively, you can try to upgrade your `pandas_profiling` to the latest version, which should be compatible with the latest pandas version. You can do this by running:

```bash
pip install --upgrade pandas_profiling
```

or

```bash
conda update pandas_profiling
```

For the second error, the `profile_report()` function is a method of the `pandas_profiling` module, not the `DataFrame` object. You should use it like this:

```python
import pandas_profiling

profile = pandas_profiling.ProfileReport(data)
profile.to_widgets()
```

or

```python
import pandas_profiling

profile = pandas_profiling.ProfileReport(data)
profile.to_file("your_report.html")
```

This will generate the profile report and display it in Jupyter notebook widgets or save it to an HTML file respectively.
