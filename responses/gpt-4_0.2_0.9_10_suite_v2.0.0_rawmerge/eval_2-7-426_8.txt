The CSRF token mismatch error usually happens when the application is unable to verify the CSRF token that is sent with the request. Since you mentioned that it's working fine locally, it's likely that the issue is related to your server configuration.

Here are a few things you could check:

1. **Domain Configuration**: Ensure that your `APP_URL` in the `.env` file matches the domain you're using. If you're using `www` in your domain, make sure it's included in the `APP_URL`.

2. **Session Configuration**: Check your `config/session.php` file. The `domain` option should be set to your domain name. If it's set to `null`, Laravel will try to guess the domain, which can sometimes lead to issues.

3. **Cookie Configuration**: In your `config/session.php` file, ensure that the `secure` option is set to `true` if you're using HTTPS, and `false` if you're not.

4. **Middleware**: Ensure that the `VerifyCsrfToken` middleware is applied to the routes that are causing the issue.

5. **Cache**: Try clearing your application cache using `php artisan config:cache` and `php artisan cache:clear`.

6. **Server Configuration**: Some hosting providers or server configurations may interfere with session handling. For example, some server configurations may not allow the `file` session driver to work properly. If possible, try using a different session driver like `database` or `redis` and see if the issue persists.

7. **Permissions**: Ensure that the `storage/framework/sessions` directory is writable by the server.

8. **Session Cookie Name**: If you have other Laravel applications running on the same domain, make sure they each have a unique session cookie name. You can set this in the `config/session.php` file.
