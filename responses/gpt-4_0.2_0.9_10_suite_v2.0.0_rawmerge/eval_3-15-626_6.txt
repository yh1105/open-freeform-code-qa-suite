Your code seems to be on the right track, but there are a few issues that need to be addressed. 

First, you're trying to use `query` and `currentSheet` as variables, but you haven't declared them as such. You should declare them at the beginning of your subroutine with `Dim query As String` and `Dim currentSheet As String`.

Second, you're trying to use `query.Name` in your connection string and command text, but `query` is a string, not an object, so it doesn't have a `Name` property. You should just use `query` directly.

Here's the corrected code:

```vba
Sub LoadToWorksheetOnly()

    Dim query As String
    Dim currentSheet As String

    query = Sheets("Sheet6").Range("A1").Value 'here is where my query from power query is. I put the text from power query advanced editor in another sheet cell.
    currentSheet = ActiveSheet.Name
    With ActiveSheet.ListObjects.Add(SourceType:=0, Source:= _
        "OLEDB;Provider=Microsoft.Mashup.OleDb.1;Data Source=$Workbook$;Location=" & query _
        , Destination:=Sheets("target").Range("$A$1")).QueryTable
        .CommandType = xlCmdDefault
        .CommandText = Array("SELECT * FROM [" & query & "]")
        .RowNumbers = False
        .FillAdjacentFormulas = False
        .PreserveFormatting = True
        .RefreshOnFileOpen = False
        .BackgroundQuery = True
        .RefreshStyle = xlInsertDeleteCells
        .SavePassword = False
        .SaveData = True
        .AdjustColumnWidth = True
        .RefreshPeriod = 0
        .PreserveColumnInfo = False
        .Refresh BackgroundQuery:=False
    End With

End Sub
```

This code should work if `query` is the name of a Power Query query in your workbook. If `query` is supposed to be the M code for a Power Query query, then you'll need a different approach, as VBA doesn't directly support creating or modifying Power Query queries.
