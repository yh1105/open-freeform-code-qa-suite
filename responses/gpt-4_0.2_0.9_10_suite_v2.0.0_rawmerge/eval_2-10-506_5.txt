You can use the `iter()` method to create an iterator over the vector, and then use the `min()` method to find the minimum value. The `min()` method returns an `Option` that contains the minimum value if the vector is not empty, or `None` if it is.

Here is an example:

```rust
let v = vec![5, 6, 8, 4, 2, 7];
let min = v.iter().min();

match min {
    Some(min) => println!("The minimum value is {}", min),
    None => println!("The vector is empty"),
}
```

In this example, `min()` returns `Some(2)`, so `Some(min)` is matched and `2` is printed.

If the vector is empty, `min()` returns `None`, so `None` is matched and "The vector is empty" is printed.
