The error message is referring to the `:key` attribute in your `v-for` loop. Vue.js requires a unique key for each item in a list for it to keep track of each node's identity. This makes it more efficient when updating the virtual DOM.

The `:key` attribute should be a unique primitive value - a string or a number. In your case, you're using the entire `comment` object as the key, which is a non-primitive value. That's why Vue is giving you a warning.

Assuming each `comment` has a unique id, you can use that as the key:

```html
<div v-for="comment in comments" :key="comment.id">
```

If there's no unique id, you can use the index of the loop:

```html
<div v-for="(comment, index) in comments" :key="index">
```

Just remember that using the index as the key can lead to issues if the order of items in your list can change, or items can be added or removed. It's always better to use a unique id if one is available.
