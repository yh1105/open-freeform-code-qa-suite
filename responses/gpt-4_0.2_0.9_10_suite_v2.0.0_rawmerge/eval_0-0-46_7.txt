The error message `Parsing error: Cannot read file '.../tsconfig.json'.eslint` suggests that ESLint is unable to find or read your `tsconfig.json` file. This could be due to a few reasons:

1. The path to `tsconfig.json` in your `.eslintrc.js` file is incorrect.
2. The `tsconfig.json` file is not properly formatted or contains errors.

Let's try to solve this issue:

1. **Check the path to `tsconfig.json` in `.eslintrc.js`**

In your `.eslintrc.js` file, you have specified the `project` option under `parserOptions` as `"tsconfig.json"`. This tells ESLint to look for `tsconfig.json` in the same directory as `.eslintrc.js`. If your `tsconfig.json` is not in the same directory, you need to provide the correct relative path.

For example, if your `tsconfig.json` is in the root directory and your `.eslintrc.js` is in a subdirectory, you would need to change the `project` option to `"../tsconfig.json"`.

2. **Check the contents of `tsconfig.json`**

Your `tsconfig.json` file seems to be correctly formatted based on the content you provided. However, it's worth checking if there are any invisible characters or other issues that might be causing ESLint to fail when reading the file. You can use an online JSON validator to check this.

If none of the above solutions work, you might want to consider creating a new `tsconfig.json` file using the `tsc --init` command and then copying your configuration options to the new file. This can help if there are any hidden issues with your current `tsconfig.json` file.

Also, ensure that you have the necessary ESLint plugins installed and that your versions of ESLint and the plugins are compatible with each other.
