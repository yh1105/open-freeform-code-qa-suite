The error you're seeing is due to the fact that macOS Catalina dropped support for 32-bit applications, and `pdftk` is a 32-bit application. 

You can try to use `pdftk-java` as an alternative. It's a rewrite of `pdftk` in Java, which should work on Catalina.

Here are the steps to install `pdftk-java`:

1. First, you need to install Homebrew if you haven't done so already. Open Terminal and paste the following command:

```markdown
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

2. Once Homebrew is installed, you can install `pdftk-java` by running:

```markdown
brew install pdftk-java
```

3. After the installation, you can use `pdftk-java` in the same way as `pdftk`. However, you need to replace `pdftk` with `pdftk-java` in your commands.

For example, if you used to run `pdftk input.pdf output output.pdf`, you should now run `pdftk-java input.pdf output output.pdf`.

If you want to keep using `pdftk` instead of `pdftk-java`, you can create an alias. Add the following line to your `.zshrc` or `.bashrc` file:

```markdown
alias pdftk='pdftk-java'
```

Then, source your `.zshrc` or `.bashrc` file:

```markdown
source ~/.zshrc
```

or

```markdown
source ~/.bashrc
```

Now, you should be able to use `pdftk` command as before.
