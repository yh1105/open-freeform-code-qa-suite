Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that provides low-level utility classes to build custom designs. It doesn't provide a direct way to target child elements like you would do in traditional CSS with the child combinator (`>`).

However, you can use `@apply` directive in your CSS to apply Tailwind classes to your specific selector. Here's an example:

```css
div.section > div {
  @apply bg-red-500 text-white;
}
```

In this example, direct children `div` of `div` with class `section` will have a red background and white text.

Remember to enable this feature in your Tailwind CSS configuration file (`tailwind.config.js`) if it's not enabled:

```js
module.exports = {
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  variants: {},
  plugins: [],
  corePlugins: {
    preflight: true,
  },
}
```

The `preflight` option includes Normalize.css and additional base styles for you, which is a set of modern, sensible reset styles.

Please note that using `@apply` is not the "utility-first" way of doing things in Tailwind and should be used sparingly. The utility-first way would be to add the classes directly to the HTML elements.
