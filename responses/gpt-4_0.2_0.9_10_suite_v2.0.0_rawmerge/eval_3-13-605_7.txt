The error message you're seeing is due to a mismatch between the Kotlin version used to compile the Stripe library and the Kotlin version in your project. 

To fix this, you need to update your Kotlin version to match the one used by Stripe. You can do this by updating the Kotlin version in your project's build.gradle file. 

Here's how you can do it:

1. Open your project level `build.gradle` file.

2. Update the Kotlin version to `1.5.1` or later in the `buildscript` block:

```markdown
buildscript {
    ext.kotlin_version = '1.5.1'
    repositories {
        google()
        jcenter()
    }
    dependencies {
        classpath "org.jetbrains.kotlin:kotlin-gradle-plugin:$kotlin_version"
        // NOTE: Do not place your application dependencies here; they belong
        // in the individual module build.gradle files
    }
}
```

3. Sync your project.

As for adding the email and cardholder name in Stripe, the `CardMultilineWidget` does not support these fields. You will need to create your own UI to collect these details. 

Here's a simple example of how you can do it:

```kotlin
val cardholderNameEditText: EditText = findViewById(R.id.cardholderNameEditText)
val emailEditText: EditText = findViewById(R.id.emailEditText)

val cardholderName: String = cardholderNameEditText.text.toString()
val email: String = emailEditText.text.toString()

// Use these values along with the CardMultilineWidget to create your PaymentMethodCreateParams
val card = cardInputWidget.card
if (card != null) {
    val billingDetails = PaymentMethod.BillingDetails.Builder()
        .setName(cardholderName)
        .setEmail(email)
        .build()

    val paymentMethodCreateParams = PaymentMethodCreateParams.create(card, billingDetails)
    // Use paymentMethodCreateParams for your payment
}
```

This is a simple example and you might need to add more checks and validations based on your requirements.
