The error you're seeing is likely a false positive from rust-analyzer, which is a language server that provides IDE-like features for Rust. It's not always 100% accurate and sometimes can report errors that aren't actually there, especially when it comes to macros.

The `$crate::format_args` is a macro used internally by Rust for formatting strings. The error message suggests that rust-analyzer is having trouble resolving this macro, but since your code compiles and runs correctly, it's clear that the actual Rust compiler isn't having this problem.

To fix this, you can try a few things:

1. **Update rust-analyzer and your Rust toolchain**: Sometimes these errors can be caused by using an outdated version of rust-analyzer or the Rust compiler. You can update rust-analyzer through your editor's extension/plugin manager, and you can update your Rust toolchain by running `rustup update` in your terminal.

2. **Restart your editor**: Sometimes rust-analyzer can get into a bad state, and simply restarting your editor can fix the problem.

3. **Check your rust-analyzer settings**: If you're using Visual Studio Code, you can open the settings (File > Preferences > Settings) and search for "rust-analyzer". Make sure the "Cargo Features" and "Proc Macro" options are enabled.

4. **Ignore the error**: If none of the above solutions work, and the error is not causing any actual problems with your code, you can choose to ignore it. It's not ideal, but sometimes it's the best option if the error is a false positive from rust-analyzer.

Remember, rust-analyzer is a tool to help you write Rust code, but it's not always perfect. The ultimate source of truth is the Rust compiler itself. If your code compiles and runs correctly, then it's correct, regardless of what rust-analyzer says.
