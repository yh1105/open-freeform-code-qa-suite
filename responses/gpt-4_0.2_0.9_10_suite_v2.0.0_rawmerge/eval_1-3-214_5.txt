The error message you're getting is due to the fact that the `join_axes` parameter was deprecated in pandas 1.0.0 and removed in pandas 1.1.0. The `pandas_profiling` library you're using is probably not compatible with the version of pandas you have installed.

Here are a few steps to solve this problem:

1. Uninstall the current version of `pandas_profiling`:

```bash
pip uninstall pandas_profiling
```

or

```bash
conda uninstall pandas_profiling
```

2. Install a specific version of `pandas_profiling` that is compatible with your pandas version. For example, `pandas_profiling` version 2.8.0 should work:

```bash
pip install pandas_profiling==2.8.0
```

or

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge pandas_profiling=2.8.0
```

3. Now, you should be able to generate a profile report without any errors:

```python
from pandas_profiling import ProfileReport

profile = ProfileReport(data)
profile.to_widgets()
```

or

```python
import pandas_profiling

profile = pandas_profiling.ProfileReport(data)
profile.to_widgets()
```

Remember to replace `data` with your actual DataFrame.

If you still encounter issues, you might want to consider downgrading your pandas version to a version that is compatible with `pandas_profiling`. However, this could potentially break other parts of your code that rely on features of the newer pandas version.
