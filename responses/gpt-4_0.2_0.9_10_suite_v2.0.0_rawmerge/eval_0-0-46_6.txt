The error you're seeing is likely due to ESLint not being able to find your `tsconfig.json` file. In your `.eslintrc.js` file, you've specified the `project` property in `parserOptions` as `"tsconfig.json"`. This tells ESLint to look for the `tsconfig.json` file in the same directory as the `.eslintrc.js` file.

If your `tsconfig.json` file is not in the same directory as your `.eslintrc.js` file, you'll need to provide the correct relative path. For example, if your `tsconfig.json` file is in the root directory of your project and your `.eslintrc.js` file is in a subdirectory, you would need to change the `project` property to `"../tsconfig.json"`.

Here's how you can modify your `.eslintrc.js` file:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  // ...
  parserOptions: {
    project: "./tsconfig.json", // or the correct relative path to your tsconfig.json file
    sourceType: "module",
  },
  // ...
};
```

After making this change, you should restart your IDE or editor to ensure the changes are picked up.

If the issue persists, please double-check the location of your `tsconfig.json` file and ensure that the path specified in the `project` property is correct.
