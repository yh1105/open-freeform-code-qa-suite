You can use the `MSForms.DataObject` to interact with the clipboard. This object is part of the Microsoft Forms 2.0 Object Library, so you need to add a reference to it in your VBA environment (VBE > Tools > References > Microsoft Forms 2.0 Object Library).

Here is a simple function to copy text to the clipboard:

```vba
Public Sub CopyToClipboard(s As String)
    Dim DataObj As MSForms.DataObject
    Set DataObj = New MSForms.DataObject
    DataObj.SetText s
    DataObj.PutInClipboard
End Sub
```

You can use this function to copy the value of `NodeKey` to the clipboard:

```vba
Call CopyToClipboard(Me.NodeKey.Value)
```

This will put the value of `NodeKey` in the clipboard, and you can paste it anywhere you want.
