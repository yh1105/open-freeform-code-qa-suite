The `@Autowired` annotation was required in earlier versions of Spring to inject dependencies. However, since Spring 4.3, if a class has only one constructor, the `@Autowired` annotation is no longer necessary. Spring will use that constructor automatically for dependency injection.

The reason some people still use `@Autowired` on constructors could be due to:

1. **Backward compatibility**: If the codebase needs to be compatible with older versions of Spring, the `@Autowired` annotation is still required.

2. **Explicitness**: Some developers prefer to make it explicit that a constructor is being used for autowiring, even though it's not necessary with newer versions of Spring.

3. **Multiple constructors**: If a class has more than one constructor, Spring won't know which one to use for autowiring unless you specify `@Autowired` on the desired constructor.
