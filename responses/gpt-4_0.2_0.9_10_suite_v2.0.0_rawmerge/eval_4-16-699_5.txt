You can use the `-split` operator in PowerShell to split the string at the `-354` sequence and then take the first part. However, you need to add `-354` back to the result. Here's how you can do it:

```powershell
$FileArray = @("Name1-354-03.pdf", "Name23-354-H11.pdf", "Name354-354-02.pdf", "Name3545-354.pdf")
ForEach ($n in $FileArray){
    $split = $n -split "-354", 2
    Write-Host ($split[0] + "-354")
}
```

This script splits each string in `$FileArray` at the `-354` sequence into two parts and then prints the first part with `-354` added back.

The `2` in `-split "-354", 2` ensures that the string is split into at most two parts. This is useful if `-354` appears more than once in the string. Without it, the string would be split at every occurrence of `-354`.
