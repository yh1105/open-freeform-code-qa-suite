Yes, there is a better way to do this in Rust using the `?` operator. The `?` operator is used for error propagation. When used with `Option<T>`, it either returns the value inside an `Some` or it returns early from the function with `None`.

Here's how you can refactor your code:

```rust
fn main() {
    match func() {
        Some(result) => {
            // Do something with result
        }
        None => println!("A function returned None"),
    }
}

fn func() -> Option<ResultType> {
    let i = func1()?;
    let j = func2(i)?;
    let k = func3(j)?;
    let result = func4(k)?;
    Some(result)
}
```

In this refactored code, `func` is a new function that calls `func1`, `func2`, `func3`, and `func4` in order. If any of these functions return `None`, the `?` operator will cause `func` to immediately return `None` as well. If all functions return `Some(value)`, `func` will return `Some(result)` where `result` is the result of `func4`.

This way, you have a cleaner, flatter structure where everything appears in a sensible order. However, please note that this will not print which function returned `None`. If you need to know which function returned `None`, you might need to use `Result<T, E>` instead of `Option<T>` and return a custom error.
