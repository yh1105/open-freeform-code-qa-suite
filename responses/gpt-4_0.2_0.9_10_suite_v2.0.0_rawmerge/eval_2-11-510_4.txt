The error "error: ‘std::filesystem’ has not been declared" occurs because you are trying to use the `std::filesystem` namespace which is not declared in the `<experimental/filesystem>` library. 

In C++17, the filesystem library is still experimental and is under the `std::experimental::filesystem` namespace. So you should use `std::experimental::filesystem` instead of `std::filesystem`.

Here is the corrected code:

```c++
#include <experimental/filesystem>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

namespace fs = std::experimental::filesystem;

int main(int argc, char** argv)
{
    std::string imageDirectory = "./image";
    std::vector<std::string> imagePath;
    for (const auto& entry: fs::directory_iterator(imageDirectory))
    {
        imagePath.push_back(entry.path());
        std::cout << entry.path() << std::endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
```

In the corrected code, I've added a namespace alias `fs` for `std::experimental::filesystem` to make the code cleaner and easier to read.

Also, please note that in C++17, the filesystem library is still experimental and not all compilers support it. If you are using GCC, you need version 8 or later to use the filesystem library without the experimental namespace. If you are using an older version of GCC, you may need to link against `-lstdc++fs` to use the filesystem library.
