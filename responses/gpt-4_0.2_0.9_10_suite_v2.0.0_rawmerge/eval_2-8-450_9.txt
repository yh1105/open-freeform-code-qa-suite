Sure, here is the `ClientInfo` struct that matches the JSON structure you provided:

```go
type ClientInfo struct {
	Clients []struct {
		Hostname string `json:"Hostname"`
		IP       string `json:"IP"`
		MacAddr  string `json:"MacAddr"`
	} `json:"Clients"`
}
```

This struct uses anonymous struct for the `Clients` field, which is an array of objects. Each object has `Hostname`, `IP`, and `MacAddr` fields, all of which are strings. The `json` struct tags are used to map the Go struct fields to the corresponding JSON fields.
