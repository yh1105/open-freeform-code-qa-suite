Yes, you can draw vertical lines (vertical dividers) between components in Flutter. You can use the `VerticalDivider` widget to achieve this. 

Here is a simple example:

```dart
Row(
  children: <Widget>[
    Expanded(
      child: Text('Component 1'),
    ),
    const VerticalDivider(
      color: Colors.grey,
      thickness: 1,
    ),
    Expanded(
      child: Text('Component 2'),
    ),
  ],
)
```

In this example, a vertical line (divider) is drawn between two text components. You can customize the color and thickness of the divider by using the `color` and `thickness` properties respectively.

Please note that `VerticalDivider` is a widget that displays a vertical line with a thickness defined by `thickness` and a color defined by `color`. It's always centered within its parent. If it is placed in a horizontal layout, it will take up the full height and will be centered vertically. If it is placed in a vertical layout, it will take up the full width and will be centered horizontally.
