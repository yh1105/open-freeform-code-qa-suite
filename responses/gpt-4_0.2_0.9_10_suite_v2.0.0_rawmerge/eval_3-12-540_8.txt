Yes, Flutter provides a widget called `VerticalDivider` to draw vertical lines between components. 

Here is an example of how to use it:

```dart
Row(
  children: <Widget>[
    Expanded(
      child: Text('Item 1'),
    ),
    const VerticalDivider(
      color: Colors.grey,
      thickness: 1,
      width: 20,
    ),
    Expanded(
      child: Text('Item 2'),
    ),
    const VerticalDivider(
      color: Colors.grey,
      thickness: 1,
      width: 20,
    ),
    Expanded(
      child: Text('Item 3'),
    ),
  ],
)
```

In this example, `VerticalDivider` is used to draw vertical lines between three text widgets. The `color`, `thickness`, and `width` properties can be used to customize the appearance of the divider. 

Please note that `VerticalDivider` is only visible when used in a `Row` widget. If you use it in a `Column` widget, it won't be visible because its height is 0.
