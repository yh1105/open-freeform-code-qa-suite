The error log shows that the build process is unable to find Python in your system. Node-gyp, which is a part of the build process, requires Python to work. 

Here are the steps to fix this issue:

1. **Install Python**: If Python is not installed on your system, you need to install it. You can download Python from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Node-gyp requires Python 2.7, so make sure to install that version. Python 3.x is not supported.

2. **Set the PATH**: After installing Python, you need to add it to your system's PATH environment variable. This allows the system to find Python when needed. Here's how you can do it:

    - Open the Start Menu and search for "Environment Variables".
    - Click on "Edit the system environment variables".
    - In the System Properties window that opens, click on "Environment Variables".
    - In the Environment Variables window, under "System variables", find the variable named "Path" and click on "Edit".
    - In the Edit Environment Variable window, click on "New" and add the path to the Python installation directory. This is usually `C:\Python27\`.

3. **Install Windows Build Tools**: Node-gyp also requires some additional tools to work on Windows. You can install these using npm (Node Package Manager) by running the following command in the command prompt:

    ```bash
    npm install --global --production windows-build-tools
    ```

    This command installs both Python 2.7 (if it's not already installed) and the Visual Studio Build Tools.

4. **Rebuild the project**: After following the above steps, try to rebuild your project. The build process should now be able to find Python and complete successfully.

Remember to run your command prompt or terminal as an administrator when executing these commands.
