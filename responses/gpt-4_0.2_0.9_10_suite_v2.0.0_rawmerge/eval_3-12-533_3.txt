The issue you're facing is due to the fact that the `GestureDetector` widget only detects gestures on its child widget. If the child doesn't occupy the entire screen, the gestures outside the child won't be detected.

To solve this, you can wrap your `GestureDetector` with an `Expanded` or `Container` widget to make it occupy the entire screen. Here's how you can do it:

```dart
class QQHome extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      debugShowCheckedModeBanner: false,
      theme: ThemeData(
        primaryColor: Colors.blueGrey,
      ),
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          centerTitle: true,
          title: Text('QuoteQuota'),
        ),
        body: Container(
          width: double.infinity,
          height: double.infinity,
          child: GestureDetector(
            onTap: () => print('Tapped'),
            child: QQBody(),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class QQBody extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Center(
      child: Text(
        'Hello, World!'
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this code, the `Container` widget with `width: double.infinity` and `height: double.infinity` will take up the entire screen, and the `GestureDetector` will detect taps anywhere on the screen.
