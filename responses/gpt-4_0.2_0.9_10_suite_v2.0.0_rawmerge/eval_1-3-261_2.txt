The error you're encountering is a known issue with the `pytube` library. The HTTP 410 error means that the resource you're trying to access is no longer available at the requested URL. This is often due to changes in YouTube's backend.

As of now, the issue has been fixed in the latest version of `pytube`. You can upgrade `pytube` to the latest version using pip:

```bash
pip install pytube --upgrade
```

If you're still encountering the issue after upgrading, you can try using `pytube3` which is a fork of `pytube` with some additional fixes:

```bash
pip install pytube3
```

Then, you can use `pytube3` in your code like this:

```python
from pytube import YouTube

#ask for the link from user
link = input("Enter the link of YouTube video you want to download:  ")
yt = YouTube(link)

#Showing details
print("Title: ",yt.title)
print("Number of views: ",yt.views)
print("Length of video: ",yt.length)
print("Rating of video: ",yt.rating)
#Getting the highest resolution possible
ys = yt.streams.get_highest_resolution()

#Starting download
print("Downloading...")
ys.download()
print("Download completed!!")
```

If none of the above solutions work, you may want to consider using another library for downloading YouTube videos, such as `youtube_dl`.
