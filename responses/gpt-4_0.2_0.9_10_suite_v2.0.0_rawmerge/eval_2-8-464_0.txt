The error message `fork/exec /var/task/main: no such file or directory` is indicating that AWS Lambda is unable to find the binary file to execute. This is likely due to the fact that you're building your Go application on a Windows machine, which will produce a Windows executable (main.exe), but AWS Lambda expects a Linux binary.

To resolve this issue, you need to build your Go application for Linux. You can do this by setting the `GOOS` and `GOARCH` environment variables when building your Go application. Here's how you can do it:

```bash
set GOOS=linux
set GOARCH=amd64
go build -o main main.go
```

This will produce a Linux binary named `main`. You can then zip this binary and upload it to AWS Lambda:

```bash
zip function.zip main
```

Remember to set the handler name to `main` when you upload the zip file to AWS Lambda.

This should resolve the issue and your Lambda function should now execute without any problems.
