In Rust, the caret (`^`) operator is not used for exponentiation. It is actually the bitwise XOR operator. 

To perform exponentiation in Rust, you can use the `.pow()` method. Here is an example:

```rust
fn main() {
    let base = 2;
    let exponent = 3;
    let result = base.pow(exponent);
    println!("The result is {}", result); // Outputs: The result is 8
}
```

In this example, `base.pow(exponent)` raises `base` to the power of `exponent`. 

Please note that the `.pow()` method is available for integer types (`i8`, `i16`, `i32`, `i64`, `i128`, `isize`, `u8`, `u16`, `u32`, `u64`, `u128`, `usize`) and floating-point types (`f32`, `f64`). For integer types, the exponent must be `u32`, while for floating-point types, the exponent can be `f32` or `f64`.
