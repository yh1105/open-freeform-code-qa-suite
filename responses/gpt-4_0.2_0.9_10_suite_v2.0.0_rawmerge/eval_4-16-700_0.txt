You can optimize your bash script by using `awk` command which is more efficient for text processing. Here is an optimized version of your script:

```bash
awk -F'=' '
  /^name/ {name=$2; next} 
  /^value/ && name {print name"="$2; name=""}
' input.txt > output.txt
```

This script works as follows:

- `-F'='` sets the field separator to `=`.
- `/^name/ {name=$2; next}` if the line starts with `name`, it saves the value and skips to the next line.
- `/^value/ && name {print name"="$2; name=""}` if the line starts with `value` and `name` is not empty, it prints the `name=value` pair and resets `name` to empty.
