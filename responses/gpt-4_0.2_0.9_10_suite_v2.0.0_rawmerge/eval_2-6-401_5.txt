You can use the factory pattern to create different instances of `ServiceBusClient` with different queue names. Here's an example of how you can do this:

First, create a factory interface:

```c#
public interface IServiceBusClientFactory
{
    ServiceBusSender CreateSender(string queueName);
    ServiceBusReceiver CreateReceiver(string queueName);
}
```

Then, implement this interface:

```c#
public class ServiceBusClientFactory : IServiceBusClientFactory
{
    private readonly ServiceBusClient _serviceBusClient;

    public ServiceBusClientFactory(string connectionString)
    {
        _serviceBusClient = new ServiceBusClient(connectionString, new ServiceBusClientOptions
        {
            TransportType = ServiceBusTransportType.AmqpWebSockets
        });
    }

    public ServiceBusSender CreateSender(string queueName)
    {
        return _serviceBusClient.CreateSender(queueName);
    }

    public ServiceBusReceiver CreateReceiver(string queueName)
    {
        return _serviceBusClient.CreateReceiver(queueName, new ServiceBusReceiverOptions
        {
            ReceiveMode = ServiceBusReceiveMode.PeekLock
        });
    }
}
```

Now, you can register this factory in your DI container:

```c#
_services.AddSingleton<IServiceBusClientFactory>(implementationFactory =>
{
    var serviceBusConfiguration = implementationFactory.GetRequiredService<Microsoft.Extensions.Options.IOptions<UserEventConsumerSetting>>().Value;
    return new ServiceBusClientFactory(serviceBusConfiguration.ServiceBusConnectionString);
});
```

Finally, you can inject the factory into your service and create a `ServiceBusSender` or `ServiceBusReceiver` for any queue:

```c#
public class CarReservationMessagingService
{
    private readonly ServiceBusSender _serviceBusSender;

    public CarReservationMessagingService(IServiceBusClientFactory serviceBusClientFactory)
    {
        _serviceBusSender = serviceBusClientFactory.CreateSender("queueName");
    }

    // ...
}
```

This way, you can create multiple `ServiceBusSender` or `ServiceBusReceiver` instances with different queue names using the same `ServiceBusClient` instance.
