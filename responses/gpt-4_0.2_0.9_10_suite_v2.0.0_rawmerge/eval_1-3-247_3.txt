The error message `NoReverseMatch at / Reverse for 'profile' with arguments '('',)' not found. 1 pattern(s) tried: ['profile/(?P[^/]+)/$']` is indicating that Django is unable to find a URL pattern that matches the arguments provided for the 'profile' URL.

The issue is likely occurring in your `index.html` file, specifically on this line:

```html
<a href="{% url 'profile' post.author.username %}">
```

The error is saying that it's trying to reverse the URL for 'profile' with an empty string as the argument. This suggests that `post.author.username` is `None` or an empty string for at least one of your `NewPost` instances.

To fix this, you should ensure that every `NewPost` instance has an associated `User` with a non-empty `username`. You can add a check in your template to only create the link if `post.author.username` exists:

```html
{% if post.author.username %}
    <a href="{% url 'profile' post.author.username %}">
        @{{post.author.username}}
    </a>
{% endif %}
```

This will prevent the error from occurring, but you should also investigate why some of your `NewPost` instances don't have an associated `User` with a `username`, or why the `username` is empty. It could be a sign of a problem with your data or how you're creating `NewPost` instances.
