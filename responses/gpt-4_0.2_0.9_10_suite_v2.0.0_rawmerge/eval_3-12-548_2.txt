Use `WillPopScope` instead of `Navigator.pop(context)` or `Navigator.of(context).pop()`. 

`WillPopScope` is a widget in Flutter that detects when the user has pressed the back button on their device and calls a function you specify. You can use this to prevent the user from going back to the previous screen.

Here's an example of how you can use it:

```dart
return WillPopScope(
  onWillPop: () async => false, // prevent the user from going back
  child: Scaffold(
    // your widgets here
  ),
);
```

In this example, when the user presses the back button, the `onWillPop` function is called. This function returns a Future that resolves to false, which tells Flutter to do nothing (i.e., not go back).
