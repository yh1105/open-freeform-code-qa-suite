GitLab CI/CD does not support nested variable expansion in the `variables` section of the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file. This is a limitation of GitLab CI/CD, not the `bash` runner.

The `variables` section only supports simple variable expansion. This means that you can use a single variable inside another one, but you cannot use complex expressions like nested variables or default values.

In your case, you can use a script to achieve the same result:

```yaml
job1:
  script:
    - GIT_BRANCH="${CI_MERGE_REQUEST_SOURCE_BRANCH_NAME:-${CI_COMMIT_BRANCH:-$CI_DEFAULT_BRANCH}}"
    - echo $GIT_BRANCH
```

This script will first evaluate the `GIT_BRANCH` variable using bash's parameter expansion, and then print the result.
