You should use `@Configuration` when you want to define beans explicitly in your application. This annotation is used with classes that define methods annotated with `@Bean`. Each such `@Bean` method will produce a bean managed by the Spring container. 

On the other hand, `@Service`, `@Controller`, and `@Component` are used for auto-detection and auto-configuration of beans. They are typically used at the class level and Spring automatically scans for them to identify components to include in the application context.

So, if you need more control over the bean instantiation and configuration process, use `@Configuration`. If you prefer convention over configuration and want to leverage Spring's auto-configuration capabilities, use `@Service`, `@Controller`, or `@Component`.
