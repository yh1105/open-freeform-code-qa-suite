The error you're seeing is likely because the Gradle version you're using doesn't support Java 17 yet. 

As of the time of writing, Gradle 7.3 is the first version that provides support for Java 17. You can check your Gradle version by running `./gradlew --version` in your terminal.

To upgrade Gradle, you need to change the Gradle version in your `gradle-wrapper.properties` file. This file is usually located in the `gradle/wrapper` directory in your project.

Here is an example of what the `gradle-wrapper.properties` file might look like:

```properties
distributionBase=GRADLE_USER_HOME
distributionPath=wrapper/dists
zipStoreBase=GRADLE_USER_HOME
zipStorePath=wrapper/dists
distributionUrl=https\://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-7.2-bin.zip
```

You need to change the `distributionUrl` to point to the Gradle 7.3 distribution. For example:

```properties
distributionUrl=https\://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-7.3-bin.zip
```

After you've made this change, you can refresh your project in IntelliJ IDEA, and it should start using the new Gradle version. 

If you're still having issues, you might need to invalidate caches and restart IntelliJ IDEA. You can do this by going to `File -> Invalidate Caches / Restart... -> Invalidate and Restart`.
