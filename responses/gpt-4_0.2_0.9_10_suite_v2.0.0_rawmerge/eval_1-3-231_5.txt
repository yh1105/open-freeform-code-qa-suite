Sure, you can use the `size()` method provided by PyTorch to get the size of each tensor in the list. Here is a function that does this:

```python
def getSize(t):
    sizes = [tensor.size() for tensor in t]
    return sizes
```

This function iterates over each tensor in the list `t` and appends its size to the `sizes` list. The `size()` method returns a tuple representing the size of the tensor, so the `sizes` list will be a list of tuples.

You can use this function like this:

```python
sizes = getSize(list_of_tensors)
print(sizes)
```

This will print a list of tuples, where each tuple represents the size of a tensor in the list.
