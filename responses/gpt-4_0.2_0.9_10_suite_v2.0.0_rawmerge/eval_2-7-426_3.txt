The issue you're experiencing could be due to a number of reasons. Here are a few things you could check:

1. **Domain Configuration**: Ensure that your domain is correctly configured. If you're using a domain with 'www', make sure your APP_URL in your .env file includes 'www'. If not, remove it. This is because cookies (which are used for sessions) are domain-specific.

2. **Secure Cookies**: If your application is behind a load balancer or running through a service that provides SSL termination (like Heroku, AWS ELB) then you might have the `SESSION_SECURE_COOKIE` set to true in your .env file. If this is the case, your application is likely generating secure cookies, but your load balancer may be communicating with your application over HTTP, thus the cookies are not being sent with your requests.

3. **SameSite Cookies**: Check your `session.php` configuration file. If the `same_site` parameter is set to `strict`, try changing it to `lax` or `none`. This is a new setting available in recent versions of Laravel, and it can cause issues with CSRF if not properly configured.

4. **Session Storage Permissions**: Ensure that your `storage/framework/sessions` directory is writable by your web server. If Laravel can't write to this directory, it can't store session data.

5. **Cookie Domain**: In your `session.php` configuration file, check the `domain` parameter. If it's set, it should match the domain you're serving your application from.

6. **Cache Configuration**: Clear your configuration cache using `php artisan config:clear` command. Sometimes, old cached configuration might be used which could lead to such issues.

7. **Middleware**: Ensure that `\App\Http\Middleware\VerifyCsrfToken::class` middleware is included in your `web` middleware group in `app/Http/Kernel.php`.

Remember to always clear your config cache after making changes to your .env file or configuration files. You can do this by running `php artisan config:cache` in your terminal.
