The `f` before the string in the `print` function is used to denote a f-string (formatted string literal) in Python. It was introduced in Python 3.6.

F-strings provide a concise and convenient way to embed expressions inside string literals for formatting. The expressions will be replaced by their values when the string is evaluated.

Here's an example:

```python
name = "John"
print(f"Hello, {name}")
```

In this case, `{name}` inside the f-string is an expression that gets evaluated and its value is inserted into the string. The output will be: `Hello, John`.

In your code:

```python
print(f"Input directory: {args.input_directory}")
print(f"Output directory: {args.output_directory}")
```

`{args.input_directory}` and `{args.output_directory}` are expressions that get replaced by the values of `args.input_directory` and `args.output_directory` respectively.
