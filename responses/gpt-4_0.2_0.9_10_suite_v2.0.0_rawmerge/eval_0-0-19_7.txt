The error message indicates that npm cannot find the package `aws-sdk-js` in the npm registry. This is because there is no package with the name `aws-sdk-js` in the npm registry. 

The correct name for the AWS SDK in npm is `aws-sdk`. You should install it with:

```bash
npm install --save aws-sdk
```

This command will install the `aws-sdk` package and also add it as a dependency in your `package.json` file. 

The `--save` option is used to include the package in the dependencies list in your `package.json` file. If you don't want to include it in your `package.json`, you can simply use:

```bash
npm install aws-sdk
```
