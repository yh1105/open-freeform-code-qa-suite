The error message you're seeing suggests that there's a compatibility issue between the version of Devise you're using and the version of Rails or ActiveSupport.

The latest version of Devise (4.8.0 at the time of writing) requires Rails 5.2 or later. If you're using an older version of Rails, you may need to use an older version of Devise.

Here's how you can specify a particular version of Devise in your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'devise', '~> 4.7.0'
```

After updating your Gemfile, run `bundle install` to install the specified version of Devise.

If you're already using Rails 5.2 or later and still encountering this issue, it could be a bug in Devise or in one of its dependencies. In that case, you might want to check the Devise GitHub page to see if the issue has been reported and if there are any workarounds or fixes available.

If none of the above solutions work, you may need to uninstall and reinstall the Devise gem. Here's how you can do that:

1. Remove the line `gem 'devise'` from your Gemfile.
2. Run `bundle install`.
3. Add `gem 'devise'` back to your Gemfile.
4. Run `bundle install` again.

This will force Bundler to reinstall Devise, which may resolve the issue.
