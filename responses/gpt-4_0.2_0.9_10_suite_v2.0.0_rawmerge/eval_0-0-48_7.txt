Sure, you can define the `FruitsAndColors` type as follows:

```typescript
type FruitsAndColors = {
  [K in fruit]: number;
} & {
  [K in color]: boolean;
}
```

This uses the `&` operator to combine two mapped types into one. The first mapped type assigns a `number` to each `fruit`, and the second mapped type assigns a `boolean` to each `color`.
