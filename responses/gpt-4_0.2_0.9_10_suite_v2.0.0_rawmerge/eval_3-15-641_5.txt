Unfortunately, Excel VBA doesn't have built-in support for interacting with OneDrive or SharePoint URLs directly. However, you can use the `Environ` function to get the local path of the OneDrive folder. This function returns the value of the specified system environment variable.

Here is a simple example:

```vba
Sub GetOneDrivePath()
    Dim OneDrivePath As String
    OneDrivePath = Environ("OneDrive")
    MsgBox OneDrivePath
End Sub
```

This will display a message box with the local path of the OneDrive folder. You can then use this path to interact with the files and folders in OneDrive.

Please note that this will only work if the user has set up OneDrive to sync files locally. If the files are only stored online, you will need to use the OneDrive API or SharePoint API to interact with them, which is much more complex and beyond the scope of VBA.

As for the "Open File Location" button, unfortunately, there is no way to access this functionality through VBA. The button is part of the Excel user interface and is not exposed to the VBA object model.
