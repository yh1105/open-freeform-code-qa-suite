The issue you're experiencing is due to a known bug in Safari's implementation of flexbox. The `height: auto;` isn't respected for images in a flex container. 

To fix this, you can add `align-self: flex-start;` to the image. This will align the image at the start of the cross axis, which prevents it from stretching.

Here's the updated CSS:

```css
.container {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
}

.container section:first-child {
  display: flex;
  margin-bottom: 25px;
}

.container img {
  width: 125px;
  height: auto;
  align-self: flex-start; /* Add this line */
}
```

This should solve the issue in Safari while not affecting the layout in other browsers.
