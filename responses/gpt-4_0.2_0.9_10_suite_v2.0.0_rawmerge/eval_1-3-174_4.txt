The error message `ImportError: DLL load failed while importing _psycopg: The operating system cannot run %1.` indicates that the psycopg2 library is having trouble finding the necessary PostgreSQL client libraries.

Here are a few things you could try to fix this issue:

1. **Install PostgreSQL client libraries**: If you don't have PostgreSQL installed on your machine, you might need to install it. You can download it from the official PostgreSQL website.

2. **Add PostgreSQL to your PATH**: If you have PostgreSQL installed but its bin directory is not in your PATH, you might need to add it. The bin directory contains necessary DLL files. You can do this by appending the path of the bin directory to the PATH environment variable. The path would look something like this: `C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\13\bin`.

3. **Use psycopg2-binary**: If you don't want to install PostgreSQL or modify your PATH, you can use the psycopg2-binary package instead of psycopg2. This package is a stand-alone package that includes its own PostgreSQL client libraries. You can install it with pip:

    ```bash
    pip install psycopg2-binary
    ```

    Then, in your Python code, you can import it the same way you would import psycopg2:

    ```python
    import psycopg2
    ```

    Note that psycopg2-binary is not recommended for production use. It's mainly intended for beginners and for testing, and might not work as expected in some cases. For production use, it's better to use psycopg2 with the proper PostgreSQL client libraries installed.

4. **Reinstall psycopg2**: Sometimes, reinstalling the library can fix the issue. You can uninstall it with pip:

    ```bash
    pip uninstall psycopg2
    ```

    Then install it again:

    ```bash
    pip install psycopg2
    ```

Remember to replace `pip` with `conda` if you're using Anaconda.
