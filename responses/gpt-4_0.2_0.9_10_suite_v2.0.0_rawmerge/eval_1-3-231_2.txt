Here is a Python function that will do exactly what you need. It iterates over each tensor in the list and appends its shape to a new list. This new list is then returned.

```python
def getSize(t):
    sizes = []
    for tensor in t:
        sizes.append(tensor.shape)
    return sizes
```

You can use this function like this:

```python
sizes = getSize(list_of_tensors)
print(sizes)
```

This will print a list of tuples, where each tuple represents the shape of a tensor in the original list.
