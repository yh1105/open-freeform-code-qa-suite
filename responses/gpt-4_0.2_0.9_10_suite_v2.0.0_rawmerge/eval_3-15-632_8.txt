Assuming that the data you want to split is separated by a specific character (like a space or a comma), you can use the `Split` function in VBA to split the string into an array and then assign the array elements to the cells. Here's how you can do it:

```vba
idx = InStr(textline, "Cabinet No.")
If idx > 0 Then
    Line Input #1, textline
    Line Input #1, textline
    Dim splitData() As String
    splitData = Split(textline, " ") 'replace " " with your delimiter
    ActiveSheet.Cells(nextrow, "G").Value = splitData(0)
    ActiveSheet.Cells(nextrow, "H").Value = splitData(1)
    ActiveSheet.Cells(nextrow, "I").Value = splitData(2)
    ActiveSheet.Cells(nextrow, "J").Value = splitData(3)
    ActiveSheet.Cells(nextrow, "K").Value = splitData(4)
    nextrow = nextrow + 1 'now move to next row
End If
```

This code will split the `textline` into 5 parts based on the space character and assign them to the cells in columns G, H, I, J, and K. If your data is separated by a different character, replace the space in the `Split` function with that character.
