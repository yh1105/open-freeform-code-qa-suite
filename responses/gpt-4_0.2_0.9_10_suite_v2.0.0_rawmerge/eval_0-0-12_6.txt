The error message `Error: Invalid login: 535-5.7.8 Username and Password not accepted` indicates that the username and password you are using to authenticate with the Gmail SMTP server are not correct.

Here are a few things you can check:

1. **Correctness of Credentials**: Make sure that the email address and password you are using are correct. Remember that passwords are case sensitive.

2. **Less Secure Apps**: Google may block sign-in attempts from some apps or devices that do not use modern security standards. You need to allow less secure apps to access your account. You can do this by going to your Google account settings, then to the 'Security' section, and then turning on 'Access for less secure apps'.

3. **Two-Step Verification**: If you have enabled two-step verification for your Gmail account, you may need to generate an app password and use that instead of your regular password. You can generate an app password by going to your Google account settings, then to the 'Security' section, and then 'App passwords'. Here is the direct link: [App Passwords](https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords)

4. **Display Unlock Captcha**: Sometimes Google may block a sign-in attempt from a new location or device. You can resolve this by visiting the [Display Unlock Captcha](https://accounts.google.com/DisplayUnlockCaptcha) page and following the instructions.

Remember to replace '**********' with your actual password or generated app password in the code.
