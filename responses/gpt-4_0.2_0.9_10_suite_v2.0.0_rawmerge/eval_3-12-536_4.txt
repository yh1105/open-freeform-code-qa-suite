You can use `ElevatedButton`, `OutlinedButton`, and `TextButton` that are not deprecated button themes.
You can change the `shape` property which is placed in the `style` property.

Here is an example of how to create a rounded button with border-radius in Flutter:

```dart
ElevatedButton(
  onPressed: () {
    // Handle button press
  },
  style: ElevatedButton.styleFrom(
    shape: RoundedRectangleBorder(
      borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(30), // Change this to your desired radius
    ),
  ),
  child: Text('Button'),
)
```

In this example, `ElevatedButton` is one of the new button themes in Flutter. The `shape` property is placed inside the `style` property. The `shape` property is set to `RoundedRectangleBorder` with a `borderRadius` of your desired radius. This will give the button rounded corners. The `onPressed` function is where you handle the button press. The `child` property is used to set the button label.
