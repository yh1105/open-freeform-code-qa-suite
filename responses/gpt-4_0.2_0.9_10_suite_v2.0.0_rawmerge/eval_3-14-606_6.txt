It seems like there's a misunderstanding here. iOS doesn't have a "Developer Mode" that you can enable or disable like Android. The alert you're seeing is likely related to the provisioning profile used to sign the app.

If you're trying to install an app that's been signed with a developer provisioning profile, you'll need to trust the developer on your device. Here's how to do that:

1. After the app is installed, go to the **Settings** app on your iOS device.
2. Navigate to **General** > **Device Management** or **Profiles & Device Management**.
3. Under the "Developer App" section, you should see the developer's name.
4. Tap on the developer's name, then tap on **Trust "[Developer's Name]"**.
5. In the pop-up prompt, tap **Trust** to confirm.

After doing this, you should be able to open the app.

If you're still having trouble, it's possible that the provisioning profile used to sign the app has expired or has been revoked. In that case, you'll need to get a new build of the app that's been signed with a valid provisioning profile.
