The error message is indicating that you're trying to send a JSON body with the `http.post` method, but you're not encoding your body as JSON. The `http.post` method expects a `Map<String, String>` for its body and you're providing a `Map<String, dynamic>`.

You should encode your body to JSON using `json.encode`. Here's how you can do it:

```dart
import 'dart:convert';

Map<String,String> headers = {
  'Content-Type':'application/json',
  'authorization':'Basic c3R1ZHlkb3RlOnN0dWR5ZG90ZTEyMw=='
};

Map<String, dynamic> body = {
  "grant_type":"password",
  "username":"******",
  "password":"*****",
  "scope":"offline_access"
};

var response = await post(
  Urls.getToken,
  headers: headers,
  body: json.encode(body),
);
```

In this code, `json.encode(body)` will convert your `Map<String, dynamic>` to a JSON string which can be sent in the body of your HTTP request.
