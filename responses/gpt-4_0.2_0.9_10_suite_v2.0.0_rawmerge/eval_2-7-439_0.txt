The `ext-zip` is a PHP extension for handling ZIP archives. This extension is not a package that you can install via composer. It's an extension of PHP itself, so you need to install it on your system.

Here's how you can install it:

**On Ubuntu/Debian**

You can install it via `apt-get`:

```bash
sudo apt-get install php-zip
```

**On CentOS/RHEL**

You can install it via `yum`:

```bash
sudo yum install php-pecl-zip
```

**On Windows**

1. Find your `php.ini` file (you can check where it is from `phpinfo();`).
2. Open `php.ini` file and find line `;extension=php_zip.dll`.
3. Uncomment it (remove the semicolon at the start).
4. Restart your Apache server.

**On MacOS**

You can install it via `pecl`:

```bash
pecl install zip
```

After installing the extension, you may need to restart your web server for the changes to take effect.

Then, you can add `"ext-zip": "*"` to the `require` section of your `composer.json` file to indicate that your project depends on the `ext-zip` extension. This won't actually install the extension (as it needs to be installed on the server level, not the project level), but it will prevent `composer install` from running if the extension isn't installed.
