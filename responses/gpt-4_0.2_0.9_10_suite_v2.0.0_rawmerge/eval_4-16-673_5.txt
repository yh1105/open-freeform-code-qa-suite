The `apt-get` package manager installs the version of the software that is available in the repositories configured for your system. If the latest version of `cmake` is not available in these repositories, `apt-get` will not be able to install it.

To install the latest version of `cmake`, you can download it from the official website and compile it from source. Here are the steps:

1. First, remove the existing `cmake`:

   ```bash
   sudo apt-get remove cmake
   ```

2. Then, download the latest version of `cmake` from the official website. At the time of writing, the latest version is 3.21.2. Replace `3.21.2` with the latest version number if it's different:

   ```bash
   wget https://github.com/Kitware/CMake/releases/download/v3.21.2/cmake-3.21.2.tar.gz
   ```

3. Extract the downloaded file:

   ```bash
   tar -xzvf cmake-3.21.2.tar.gz
   ```

4. Navigate to the extracted directory:

   ```bash
   cd cmake-3.21.2
   ```

5. Now, compile and install `cmake`:

   ```bash
   ./bootstrap
   make -j$(nproc)
   sudo make install
   ```

6. Verify the installation:

   ```bash
   cmake --version
   ```

This should display the version number of `cmake` that you just installed.

Please note that compiling from source might take a while depending on your system's resources. Also, you might need to install additional packages to compile `cmake` from source. If the `./bootstrap` command fails, make sure to install the required dependencies and try again.
