This error usually occurs when Xcode can't find the target to which the preview belongs. Here are some steps you can try:

1. **Check your scheme**: Make sure the scheme is set to the correct target. You can do this by going to `Product > Scheme > Edit Scheme` and checking the `Build` tab.

2. **Clean your project**: Sometimes, cleaning the project can help. You can do this by going to `Product > Clean Build Folder`.

3. **Restart Xcode**: Quit Xcode and open it again. This can help refresh the project settings.

4. **Update your Xcode**: Make sure you are using the latest version of Xcode. You can check for updates in the App Store.

5. **Recreate the preview**: Delete the existing preview and create a new one. This can help if there's an issue with the existing preview.

6. **Check your code**: Make sure there are no errors in your code. Even a small error can prevent the preview from working.

If none of these steps work, it might be a bug with Xcode. In this case, you can report it to Apple through their bug reporting system.
