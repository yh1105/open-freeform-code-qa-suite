The `rename` function is used to rename the DataFrame's index or columns. However, in your case, you are trying to rename a Series object, not a DataFrame. The `groupby` function followed by `mean` function returns a Series object, not a DataFrame. 

To rename the column of a Series, you can convert it to a DataFrame first, then use the `rename` function. Here is the function `renameDataFrame`:

```python
def renameDataFrame(df):
    avg = df.groupby(["t"], sort=False)["p"].mean().to_frame().rename(columns={"p":"mean"})
    return avg
```

In this function, `to_frame()` is used to convert the Series to a DataFrame, and then `rename` is used to rename the column. 

Here is how you can use this function:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# Assuming datain is your numpy array
datain = np.array([[1,2,3,4,5],[1,3,4,5,6],[2,4,5,6,7],[2,5,6,7,8]])
df = pd.DataFrame(data = datain, columns = ["t","p","x","y","z"])

new_df = renameDataFrame(df)
print(new_df)
```

This will print the DataFrame `new_df` with the "p" column renamed as "mean" and the average numbers grouped by "t" column.
