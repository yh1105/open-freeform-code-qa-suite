You can use the `source` command to reload your `.bash_profile` without closing and reopening your terminal. The `source` command reads and executes commands from the file specified as its argument in the current shell environment.

Here is how you can do it:

```bash
source ~/.bash_profile
```

This command will read and execute the `.bash_profile` file in your home directory. Any changes you made to the file will be applied to your current shell session.

If you're using a different shell like zsh, you might need to source the `.zshrc` file instead:

```bash
source ~/.zshrc
```

This is equivalent to:

```bash
. ~/.bash_profile
```

The `.` is a shorthand for `source`.
