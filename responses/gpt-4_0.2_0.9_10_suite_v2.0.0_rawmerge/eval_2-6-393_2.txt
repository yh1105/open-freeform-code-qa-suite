The error message you're seeing is because you're trying to create an index on a navigation property (`Gender`). In Entity Framework, you can't create an index directly on a navigation property. Instead, you should create an index on the foreign key property (`GenderId`) that the navigation property uses.

Here's how you can modify your `OnModelCreating` method:

```csharp
protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder modelBuilder)
{
    modelBuilder.Entity<User>(user =>
    {
        user
            .HasOne(x => x.Gender)
            .WithMany(x => x.Users)
            .HasForeignKey(x => x.GenderId);

        user.HasIndex(x => x.GenderId); // Create index on GenderId, not Gender
    });
}
```

In this code, `user.HasIndex(x => x.GenderId);` creates an index on the `GenderId` property of the `User` entity, which is the correct way to speed up lookups when you're querying by `Gender`.
