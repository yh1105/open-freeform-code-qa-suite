It seems like there's a misunderstanding here. iOS doesn't have a "Developer Mode" that you can enable or disable like Android. If you're trying to install a provisioned testing build, you need to ensure that the device is registered to your Apple Developer account and the provisioning profile used to sign the app includes that device.

Here are the steps to install a provisioned testing build:

1. **Register your device in the Apple Developer portal.**

    - Connect your device to your Mac.
    - Open Xcode.
    - Navigate to `Window > Devices and Simulators`.
    - Select your device from the list and copy the Identifier (UDID).
    - Log in to the [Apple Developer portal](https://developer.apple.com/account/).
    - Navigate to `Certificates, Identifiers & Profiles > Devices`.
    - Click on the '+' button to add a new device, enter a name and paste the UDID, then click `Continue`.

2. **Add the device to the provisioning profile.**

    - In the Apple Developer portal, navigate to `Certificates, Identifiers & Profiles > Profiles`.
    - Find the provisioning profile used to sign the app and click on it.
    - Click `Edit`, check the new device in the list, then click `Generate`.
    - Download the updated provisioning profile and double-click it to install in Xcode.

3. **Rebuild the app with the updated provisioning profile.**

    - In Xcode, select the project in the Project Navigator.
    - Select the target, then select the `Signing & Capabilities` tab.
    - Select the updated provisioning profile from the `Provisioning Profile` dropdown.
    - Build the app and install it on your device.

If you're not the developer and you're trying to install a testing build sent to you, you need to install it through TestFlight or ask the developer to include your device in the provisioning profile.
