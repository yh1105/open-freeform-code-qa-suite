The ESLint error you're seeing is because you're using an anonymous function as a component. ESLint expects all components to have a `displayName` for debugging purposes. 

In your case, you can solve this by either disabling the rule for that line or by creating a named function and using that instead.

Here's how you can do it:

**Option 1: Disable the rule for that line**

```jsx
const columns_payment_summary_table = [ 
    {
      title: FooConstants.LABEL_QUANTITY_SELECTED,
      dataIndex: 'group',
      key: 'group',
      render: text => (
        // eslint-disable-next-line react/display-name
        <span>{getCountForCountry(text)}</span>
      ),
    }
  ]
```

**Option 2: Create a named function**

```jsx
const renderGroup = text => <span>{getCountForCountry(text)}</span>;

const columns_payment_summary_table = [ 
    {
      title: FooConstants.LABEL_QUANTITY_SELECTED,
      dataIndex: 'group',
      key: 'group',
      render: renderGroup,
    }
  ]
```

In the second option, `renderGroup` is a named function, so ESLint won't complain about it.
