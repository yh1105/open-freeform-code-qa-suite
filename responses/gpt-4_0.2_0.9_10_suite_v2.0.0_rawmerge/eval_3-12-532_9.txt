The error message you're seeing typically indicates that the response you're receiving from your server is not valid JSON. Here are a few steps you can take to debug and resolve this issue:

1. **Check the server response**: Print the server response before trying to decode it. This will help you see exactly what you're trying to parse.

```dart
print('Response body: ${response.body}');
```

2. **Check the server-side script**: Make sure your PHP script is correctly outputting JSON. You can use `json_encode()` to convert an array or object into a JSON string.

```php
header('Content-Type: application/json');
echo json_encode($yourData);
```

3. **Handle server errors**: If the server encounters an error, it might not return valid JSON. Make sure your server-side script is correctly handling errors and always returning JSON.

4. **Check the JSON format**: If the server response looks like JSON, but you're still getting an error, it might not be correctly formatted. You can use a JSON validator to check this.

5. **Handle empty responses**: If the server returns an empty response, `json.decode()` will throw an error. You can check for this case before trying to decode the response.

```dart
if (response.body.isNotEmpty) {
  List data = json.decode(response.body);
} else {
  // Handle empty response
}
```

6. **Check the response status code**: Before decoding the response, check the status code to make sure the request was successful.

```dart
if (response.statusCode == 200) {
  List data = json.decode(response.body);
} else {
  // Handle error
}
```

By following these steps, you should be able to identify and resolve the issue causing the `FormatException`.
