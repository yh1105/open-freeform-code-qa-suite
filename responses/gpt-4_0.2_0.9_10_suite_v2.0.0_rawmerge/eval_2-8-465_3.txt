The `ext-zip` is a PHP extension for handling ZIP archives. This means it's not a package that you can install via composer, but an extension you need to enable in your PHP installation.

Here's how you can install it:

**For Ubuntu/Debian**

1. Update package lists for upgrades and new packages.

```bash
sudo apt-get update
```

2. Install the ZIP extension.

```bash
sudo apt-get install php-zip
```

3. Restart your web server.

```bash
sudo service apache2 restart
```

**For CentOS**

1. Install the ZIP extension.

```bash
sudo yum install php-pecl-zip
```

2. Restart your web server.

```bash
sudo service httpd restart
```

**For Windows**

1. Open your `php.ini` file.
2. Uncomment the line `;extension=php_zip.dll` by removing the semicolon at the start.
3. Save the `php.ini` file.
4. Restart your web server.

After you've installed and enabled the ZIP extension, you can verify it's working by running `php -m` in your terminal. This will list all enabled PHP modules, and you should see `zip` in the list.

If you're using Docker, you'll need to add the ZIP extension to your Dockerfile:

```dockerfile
RUN docker-php-ext-install zip
```

After you've installed the ZIP extension, you don't need to add it to your `composer.json` file. Composer checks the platform requirements against your current PHP environment, so as long as the ZIP extension is enabled in your PHP installation, Composer will recognize it.
