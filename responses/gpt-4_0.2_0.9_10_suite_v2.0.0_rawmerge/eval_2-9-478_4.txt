The error you're getting is likely due to a version mismatch between Devise and Rails. Devise 4.8.0 is not compatible with Rails versions below 6.1. 

Here are some steps to fix this issue:

1. If you're using Rails version 6.1 or above, you should be able to use Devise 4.8.0. You can check your Rails version by running `rails -v` in your terminal.

2. If you're using a Rails version below 6.1, you'll need to use a compatible version of Devise. You can specify the version of Devise in your Gemfile. For example, if you're using Rails 5.2, you can use Devise 4.7.3. Here's how you can specify this in your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'devise', '~> 4.7.3'
```

3. After updating your Gemfile, run `bundle install` to install the specified version of Devise.

4. If you've already installed Devise and generated the Devise files, you may need to re-run the generator after installing the correct version of the gem. You can do this with the command `rails generate devise:install`.

Remember to restart your server after making these changes. If you're still having issues, it may be helpful to check the [Devise GitHub page](https://github.com/heartcombo/devise) for any known issues or additional installation instructions.
