It sounds like you're trying to programmatically retrieve the local path of a file that's synced with SharePoint/OneDrive. Unfortunately, Excel VBA doesn't have a built-in function to retrieve the local path of a file stored on SharePoint/OneDrive.

However, you can use a workaround to get the local path. Here's a simple example:

```vba
Function GetLocalPath(strSharePointPath As String) As String
    Dim strLocalPath As String
    strLocalPath = Replace(strSharePointPath, "https://<your-sharepoint-url>/", "C:\Users\<username>\OneDrive - <organization>\")
    GetLocalPath = strLocalPath
End Function
```

This function replaces the SharePoint URL with the local OneDrive path. You'll need to replace `<your-sharepoint-url>`, `<username>`, and `<organization>` with your actual SharePoint URL, Windows username, and organization name.

Please note that this function assumes that the SharePoint files are synced to the local OneDrive folder. If the files aren't synced, the function will return an incorrect path.

Also, this function won't work if the users sync their SharePoint files to different local folders. In that case, you'll need to find a way to determine the local sync folder for each user. This could be done by storing the local sync folder in a configuration file or a database, or by asking the user to select the sync folder when they run the macro.

Lastly, creating folders and files on SharePoint using VBA is a complex task that requires using the SharePoint REST API or a third-party library. If you're interested in this approach, I can provide more information.
