The error message indicates that the SQLite database does not have a table named 'Keys'. This table is required by IdentityServer4 for storing keys.

Here are some steps you can take to resolve this issue:

1. **Create the 'Keys' table**: If the 'Keys' table does not exist in your database, you need to create it. You can do this by creating a new migration and updating the database. Use the following commands in the Package Manager Console:

```csharp
Add-Migration AddKeysTable
Update-Database
```

2. **Ensure the correct DbContext is being used**: Make sure that the DbContext that IdentityServer4 is using is the same DbContext that is configured for your application. If they are different, you might be looking at different databases or different schemas within the same database.

3. **Check your connection string**: Make sure that the connection string in your application's configuration file is correct. If the connection string is incorrect, your application might be trying to connect to a different database that does not have the 'Keys' table.

4. **Ensure the database is created**: If you are using a code-first approach, you need to ensure that the database is created before running the application. You can do this by calling the `Database.EnsureCreated()` method in your DbContext's constructor or in the `Configure` method in Startup.cs.

```csharp
public class AppDbContext : DbContext
{
    public AppDbContext(DbContextOptions<AppDbContext> options)
        : base(options)
    {
        Database.EnsureCreated();
    }
}
```

5. **Ensure the migration is applied**: If you are using a database-first approach, you need to ensure that the migration that creates the 'Keys' table is applied to the database. You can do this by calling the `Database.Migrate()` method in your DbContext's constructor or in the `Configure` method in Startup.cs.

```csharp
public class AppDbContext : DbContext
{
    public AppDbContext(DbContextOptions<AppDbContext> options)
        : base(options)
    {
        Database.Migrate();
    }
}
```

Remember to replace `AppDbContext` with the name of your DbContext.
