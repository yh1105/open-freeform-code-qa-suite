The error message `ImportError: DLL load failed while importing _psycopg: The operating system cannot run %1.` indicates that the psycopg2 module is trying to load a DLL (Dynamic-Link Library) that is not available or not compatible with your system.

Here are a few things you can try to resolve this issue:

1. **Reinstall psycopg2-binary**: Sometimes, the issue can be resolved by installing `psycopg2-binary` instead of `psycopg2`. You can do this by running the following command in your conda environment:

```bash
conda uninstall psycopg2
pip install psycopg2-binary
```

2. **Check your Python version**: Make sure that the Python version you're using is compatible with the psycopg2 version you're trying to install. You can check your Python version by running `python --version` in your command prompt.

3. **Check your PostgreSQL version**: Make sure that the PostgreSQL version you're using is compatible with the psycopg2 version you're trying to install. You can check your PostgreSQL version by running `psql --version` in your command prompt.

4. **Check your PATH**: Make sure that the PostgreSQL bin directory is in your system's PATH. You can check this by running `echo %PATH%` in your command prompt.

5. **Install Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2015**: The psycopg2 module requires the Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2015 to work. You can download it from the [Microsoft website](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=48145).

If none of the above solutions work, you might want to consider using a different PostgreSQL adapter for Python, such as `pg8000` or `SQLAlchemy`.
