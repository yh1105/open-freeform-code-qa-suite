The error message indicates that Gradle is not using the correct Java version. Even though you've set the Java version in IntelliJ IDEA, Gradle might still be using a different version.

You can specify the Java version for Gradle in a couple of ways:

1. **Gradle properties**: You can specify the Java version in the `gradle.properties` file. If the file doesn't exist, create it in the root directory of your project. Add the following lines to the file:

    ```properties
    org.gradle.java.home=/path/to/your/jdk17
    ```

    Replace `/path/to/your/jdk17` with the actual path to your JDK 17 installation.

2. **Environment variable**: You can set the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable to point to your JDK 17 installation. How to do this depends on your operating system:

    - **Windows**: Open the System Properties, go to the Advanced tab, and click on Environment Variables. Add a new system variable with the name `JAVA_HOME` and the value being the path to your JDK 17 installation.

    - **macOS/Linux**: Open a terminal and add the following line to your `.bashrc`, `.bash_profile`, or `.zshrc` file:

        ```bash
        export JAVA_HOME=/path/to/your/jdk17
        ```

        Replace `/path/to/your/jdk17` with the actual path to your JDK 17 installation. Then, run `source ~/.bashrc`, `source ~/.bash_profile`, or `source ~/.zshrc` to apply the changes.

After setting the Java version for Gradle, try running your app again. It should now use JDK 17.
