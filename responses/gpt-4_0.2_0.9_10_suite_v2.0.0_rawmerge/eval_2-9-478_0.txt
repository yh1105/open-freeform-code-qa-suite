The error you're encountering is likely due to a mismatch between the versions of Rails and Devise you're using. Devise 4.8.0 is not compatible with all versions of Rails.

Here are some steps you can take to resolve this issue:

1. **Check your Rails version**. You can do this by running `rails -v` in your terminal. 

2. **Check the Devise compatibility**. You should check which versions of Rails are compatible with Devise 4.8.0. You can usually find this information in the Devise GitHub repository's README or in the gem's documentation.

3. **Update or downgrade your Rails or Devise version**. If your Rails version is not compatible with Devise 4.8.0, you might need to update or downgrade either Rails or Devise. 

   To update Rails, you can run `gem update rails` in your terminal. 

   To downgrade or upgrade Devise, you can specify the version you want in your Gemfile. For example, if you wanted to use Devise 4.7.1, you would write `gem 'devise', '4.7.1'` in your Gemfile. After changing the Gemfile, run `bundle install` to update your gems.

4. **Create a new Rails application with a specific version**. If you're starting a new project and want to use a specific version of Rails that's compatible with Devise 4.8.0, you can specify the Rails version when creating a new application. For example, to create a new Rails 5.2.3 application, you would run `rails _5.2.3_ new myapp` in your terminal.

Remember, it's important to ensure that your gems are compatible with each other to avoid errors and conflicts.
