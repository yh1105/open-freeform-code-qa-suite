The error message is indicating that the `go_package` option is missing in your proto file. This option is used to specify the package name for the generated Go code.

You can fix this by adding a `go_package` option to your proto file. Here's how you can modify your proto file:

```go
syntax = "proto3";

package main;

option go_package = "main";

message Person {
    string name = 1;
    int32 age = 2;
}
```

In the `go_package` option, you can specify the package name that you want to use for the generated Go code. In this case, I've used "main" as the package name, but you can replace it with any valid Go package name.

After making this change, you should be able to generate the Go code without any errors.
