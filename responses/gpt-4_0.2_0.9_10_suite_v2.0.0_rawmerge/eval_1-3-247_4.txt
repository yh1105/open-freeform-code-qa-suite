The error message you're seeing is a `NoReverseMatch` error. This error is raised when Django is unable to match a URL pattern when using the `{% url %}` template tag. 

In your case, the error is occurring because the `profile` URL expects a `name` parameter, but it's receiving an empty string. This is happening because `post.author.username` is empty for at least one of your `post` objects.

The problematic line is in your `index.html` file:

```html
<a href="{% url 'profile' post.author.username %}">
    @{{post.author.username}}
</a>
```

To fix this issue, you should ensure that all `post` objects have an associated `author` with a `username`. You can add a check in your template to only create the link if `post.author.username` exists:

```html
{% if post.author.username %}
    <a href="{% url 'profile' post.author.username %}">
        @{{post.author.username}}
    </a>
{% else %}
    <p>No author</p>
{% endif %}
```

This will prevent the error from occurring, but you may want to investigate why some of your `post` objects don't have an associated `author` with a `username`, as this may indicate a problem with your data.
