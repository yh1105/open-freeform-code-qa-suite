The error message indicates that there is a problem with the command you're trying to run. It seems like the command is not properly formatted, which is causing the `cmd` program to fail.

The issue is likely related to the way the command is quoted. In Windows, you need to escape the quotes by doubling them. Here is the corrected command:

```shell
cd C:\projects\open; "JAVA_HOME=C:\\Program Files\\Java\\jdk-11.0.5" cmd /c "\"\"\"C:\\Program Files\\NetBeans-11.1\\netbeans\\java\\maven\\bin\\mvn.cmd\"\" -DskipTests=true -Dmaven.ext.class.path=\"\"C:\\Program Files\\NetBeans-11.1\\netbeans\\java\\maven-nblib\\netbeans-eventspy.jar\"\" -Dfile.encoding=UTF-8 clean install\""
```

If the problem persists, you might want to check the following:

- Make sure that the `cmd` program is available in your system's PATH.
- Verify that the paths in the command are correct and that the files exist at those locations.
- Check that you have the necessary permissions to execute the `cmd` program and to read and write in the specified directories.
