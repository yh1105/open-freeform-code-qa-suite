Sure, here is a Python function that processes a Google Drive URL and returns a direct download link for the CSV file. This function assumes that the URL is in the format of a Google Drive sharing link.

```python
def processURL(url):
    file_id = url.split('/')[-2]
    dwn_url='https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=' + file_id
    return dwn_url
```

This function works by extracting the file ID from the Google Drive sharing URL and then constructing a new URL that triggers a direct download of the file.

You can use this function in combination with `pandas.read_csv()` to read a CSV file from Google Drive, like this:

```python
import pandas as pd

url = 'https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B6GhBwm5vaB2ekdlZW5WZnppb28/view?usp=sharing'
url = processURL(url)
data = pd.read_csv(url)
```

Please note that this will only work if the file is shared publicly. If the file is private, you will need to use the Google Drive API to authenticate and access the file.
