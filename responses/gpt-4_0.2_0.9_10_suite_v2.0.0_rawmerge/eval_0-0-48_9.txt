Sure, the problem with your code is that you are trying to use the same key for two different types. You can't have a key in an object that is both a number and a boolean. Instead, you can create an intersection type to combine the two types. Here's how you can do it:

```typescript
type FruitsAndColors = {
  [key in fruit]: number;
} & {
  [key in color]: boolean;
}
```

In this code, `[key in fruit]: number;` creates a type where each fruit is a key to a number, and `[key in color]: boolean;` creates a type where each color is a key to a boolean. The `&` operator combines these two types into one.
