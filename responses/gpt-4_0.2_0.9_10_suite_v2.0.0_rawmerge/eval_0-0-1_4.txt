The issue you're experiencing might be due to a few reasons. Here are some steps you can follow to troubleshoot and fix the issue:

1. **Check your `package.json` scripts:** Vercel uses the `build` script in your `package.json` to build your application. Make sure this script is correctly set to `next build`.

```json
"scripts": {
  "dev": "next dev",
  "build": "next build",
  "start": "next start"
}
```

2. **Check your dynamic routes:** If you're using dynamic routes, make sure you're using `getStaticPaths` and `getStaticProps` (or `getServerSideProps` if you need server-side rendering) correctly. If you're using `fallback: true` in `getStaticPaths`, make sure you're handling the loading state in your component.

3. **Check your file and folder names:** Vercel is case-sensitive. Make sure the case of your file and folder names matches exactly with your imports and links.

4. **Check your public folder:** If you're using the `public` folder for static files, make sure the files exist and the paths are correct.

5. **Check your dependencies:** Make sure all your dependencies are listed in `package.json` and they're compatible with the Node.js version you're using.

6. **Check your environment variables:** If you're using environment variables, make sure they're correctly set in Vercel.

7. **Check the build logs:** The build logs in Vercel can give you more information about what's going wrong. You can access them from your Vercel dashboard.

If you're still having trouble, you might want to consider creating a minimal reproduction of your issue and asking for help on the Vercel community or Next.js GitHub issues.
