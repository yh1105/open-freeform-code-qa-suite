It seems like you're missing the `libffi` library which is a dependency for the `travis-cli`. You can install it using Homebrew.

Here are the steps to install `libffi`:

1. First, you need to install Homebrew if you haven't installed it yet. You can install it by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

2. Once Homebrew is installed, you can install `libffi` by running:

```bash
brew install libffi
```

3. After the installation, you might need to update your `PKG_CONFIG_PATH` environment variable to include the `libffi` package config file. You can do this by adding the following line to your shell profile file (`.bash_profile`, `.bashrc`, or `.zshrc` depending on your shell):

```bash
export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/usr/local/opt/libffi/lib/pkgconfig"
```

4. Then, source your profile file to update your current session. If you're using bash, the command would be:

```bash
source ~/.bash_profile
```

Or if you're using zsh, the command would be:

```bash
source ~/.zshrc
```

5. Now, you should be able to install `travis-cli` using the `gem install travis` command.
