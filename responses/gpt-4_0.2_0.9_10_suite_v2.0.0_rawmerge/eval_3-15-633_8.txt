Yes, you can achieve the same result using an array formula in Excel 2019. Here's how you can do it:

```excel
=IFERROR(INDEX($B$1:$B$100, SMALL(IF($A$1:$A$100="x", ROW($A$1:$A$100)-ROW(INDEX($A$1:$A$100,1,1))+1), ROW(1:1))), "")
```

This is an array formula, so you need to press Ctrl+Shift+Enter after typing it, instead of just Enter. Excel will then surround the formula with curly braces `{}` to indicate that it's an array formula.

This formula will return the first match. To get the next matches, you need to drag the formula down.

If you want to use a VBA Macro, here's a simple one:

```vba
Sub FilterData()
    Dim rng As Range
    Dim outRng As Range
    Dim i As Integer
    Dim j As Integer

    Set rng = Worksheets("Sheet1").Range("A1:B100")
    Set outRng = Worksheets("Sheet1").Range("D1")

    j = 0
    For i = 1 To rng.Rows.Count
        If rng.Cells(i, 1).Value = "x" Then
            outRng.Offset(j, 0).Value = rng.Cells(i, 2).Value
            j = j + 1
        End If
    Next i
End Sub
```

This macro will copy the values from column B to column D if the corresponding value in column A is "x". You can adjust the range and output location as needed.
