The issue you're facing might be due to the change in the default URL for Swagger UI. In the newer versions of Springdoc, the Swagger UI is not available at `/swagger-ui.html` anymore. Instead, it's available at `/swagger-ui/`.

So, try accessing the Swagger UI at `http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/`.

If you still can't access the Swagger UI, make sure you've enabled it in your application properties. Here is an example:

```properties
springdoc.swagger-ui.enabled=true
```

Also, ensure that you don't have any Spring Security configurations that might be blocking access to the Swagger UI.

If you want to customize the path of Swagger UI, you can do it by adding the following line to your `application.properties` file:

```properties
springdoc.swagger-ui.path=/your-custom-path
```

Then you can access Swagger UI at `http://localhost:8080/your-custom-path`.
