If the data in the line is separated by a specific delimiter (like a comma, space, or tab), you can use the `Split` function to divide the line into an array. Then, you can assign each array element to a separate cell in Excel. 

Here's an example of how you can do this:

```vba
idx = InStr(textline, "Cabinet No.")
If idx > 0 Then
    Line Input #1, textline
    Line Input #1, textline
    Dim arr() As String
    arr = Split(textline, " ") ' replace " " with your delimiter
    ActiveSheet.Cells(nextrow, "G").Value = arr(0)
    ActiveSheet.Cells(nextrow, "H").Value = arr(1)
    ActiveSheet.Cells(nextrow, "I").Value = arr(2)
    ActiveSheet.Cells(nextrow, "J").Value = arr(3)
    ActiveSheet.Cells(nextrow, "K").Value = arr(4)
    nextrow = nextrow + 1 'now move to next row
End If
```

In this example, I assumed that the delimiter is a space (" "). Replace it with the actual delimiter in your text file. Also, make sure that the line contains at least 5 elements after splitting, otherwise you'll get an error.
