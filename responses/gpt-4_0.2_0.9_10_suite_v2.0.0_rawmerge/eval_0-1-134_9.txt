It sounds like you're referring to a feature provided by a tool called Emmet. Emmet is a plugin for many popular text editors that greatly improves HTML & CSS workflow by providing shortcuts and auto-completion.

For example, if you type `.classname` and press `Tab`, it will automatically expand to `<div class="classname"></div>`.

If it's not working for you, here are a few things you could check:

1. **Check if your text editor supports Emmet**: Emmet is built-in in many text editors like VS Code, Sublime Text, Atom, Brackets, etc. If you're using a text editor that doesn't support Emmet, you might need to install it manually.

2. **Check if Emmet is enabled**: If your text editor supports Emmet, make sure it's enabled. For example, in VS Code, you can check this by going to `File > Preferences > Settings` and searching for Emmet.

3. **Check your syntax**: Make sure you're using the correct Emmet syntax. For example, `.classname` will create a `div` with the class `classname`. If you want to create an element other than a `div`, you need to specify it, like `span.classname`.

4. **Check your file type**: Emmet usually works automatically in HTML and CSS files. If you're working in a different type of file, you might need to manually trigger Emmet. For example, in VS Code, you can do this by pressing `Ctrl + Space` (or `Cmd + Space` on Mac) and then selecting `Emmet: Expand Abbreviation`.

If you've checked all these things and it's still not working, you might need to look for specific troubleshooting steps for your text editor.
