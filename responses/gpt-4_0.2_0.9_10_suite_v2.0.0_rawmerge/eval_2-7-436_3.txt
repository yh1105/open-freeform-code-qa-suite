The error message you're seeing suggests that your current PHP version, PHP extensions, or Composer version are not compatible with Laravel 9.

Here are some steps to troubleshoot this issue:

1. **Check your PHP version**: Laravel 9 requires PHP 8.0 or higher. You can check your PHP version by running `php -v` in your terminal. If your PHP version is lower than 8.0, you'll need to upgrade it.

2. **Check your PHP extensions**: Laravel 9 requires certain PHP extensions. You can check your installed extensions by running `php -m` in your terminal. Laravel 9 requires the following PHP extensions:

    - BCMath PHP Extension
    - Ctype PHP Extension
    - Fileinfo PHP extension
    - JSON PHP Extension
    - Mbstring PHP Extension
    - OpenSSL PHP Extension
    - PDO PHP Extension
    - Tokenizer PHP Extension
    - XML PHP Extension

    If any of these extensions are missing, you'll need to install them.

3. **Check your Composer version**: Although you've mentioned that you've updated Composer to version 2.3.10, it's worth double-checking this. You can check your Composer version by running `composer --version` in your terminal.

If you've checked all of these and everything seems in order, it's possible that Laravel 9 has not been released yet. At the time of writing this response (March 2023), the latest stable version of Laravel is 8.79.0. You can always check the latest version of Laravel on the [Laravel GitHub page](https://github.com/laravel/laravel).
