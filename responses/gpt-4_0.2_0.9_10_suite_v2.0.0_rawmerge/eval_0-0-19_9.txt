The error message indicates that the package `aws-sdk-js` could not be found in the npm registry. This is because the correct package name is `aws-sdk`, not `aws-sdk-js`.

You can install it using the following command:

```bash
npm install --save aws-sdk
```

This will install the AWS SDK and add it to your project's `package.json` file.
