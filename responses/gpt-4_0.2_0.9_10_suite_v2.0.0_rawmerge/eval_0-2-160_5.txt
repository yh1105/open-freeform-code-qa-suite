The `sourceMap` option in `tsconfig.json` is used for debugging purposes. When you set `"sourceMap": true`, it tells the TypeScript compiler to generate corresponding `.map` files for each `.js` file it outputs. These `.map` files are source maps.

Source maps are files that map the compiled JavaScript code back to the original TypeScript code. This is extremely useful when you're debugging your application in a browser, because it allows you to see and debug the original TypeScript code instead of the compiled JavaScript code.

If you set `"sourceMap": false`, the TypeScript compiler will not generate these `.map` files. This means that if you try to debug your application in a browser, you'll be forced to debug the compiled JavaScript code instead of the original TypeScript code.

In terms of the running application, there won't be any noticeable difference whether you have source maps enabled or not. The difference is only noticeable when you're debugging your code. 

So, if you're not planning on debugging your code in a browser, or if you're okay with debugging the compiled JavaScript code, you can set `"sourceMap": false`. Otherwise, it's recommended to leave it as `"sourceMap": true`.
