The error message you're seeing is indicating that ESLint, which is a tool for identifying and reporting on patterns in JavaScript, is having trouble reading your `tsconfig.json` file.

In your `.eslintrc.js` file, you have specified the `project` property under `parserOptions` as `"tsconfig.json"`. This tells ESLint to look for the `tsconfig.json` file in the same directory as the `.eslintrc.js` file. If your `tsconfig.json` file is not in the same directory, you will need to provide the correct relative path.

Here's how you can fix this:

1. Determine the correct relative path from your `.eslintrc.js` file to your `tsconfig.json` file. For example, if your `tsconfig.json` file is in the root directory of your project and your `.eslintrc.js` file is in a subdirectory called `config`, the relative path would be `../tsconfig.json`.

2. Update the `project` property in your `.eslintrc.js` file with the correct relative path. For example:

```javascript
parserOptions: {
  project: "../tsconfig.json",
  sourceType: "module",
},
```

3. Save your `.eslintrc.js` file and restart your editor.

If your `tsconfig.json` file is in the same directory as your `.eslintrc.js` file and you're still seeing the error, there may be a problem with the contents of your `tsconfig.json` file. In that case, you might want to validate the JSON to make sure there are no syntax errors.
