To draw a line only at the top, you should use the `border-t` class, which applies the border to the top edge only. Also, you should remove the `border` class which applies the border to all edges. Here's how you can do it:

```html
<div class="border-t border-blue-900">foo</div>
```

This will apply a border to the top edge only and it will be colored blue-900.
