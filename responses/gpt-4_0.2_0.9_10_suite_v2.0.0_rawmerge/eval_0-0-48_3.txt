Sure, the problem with your code is that TypeScript doesn't allow you to use multiple index signatures in a single type. You can solve this by creating two separate types and then merging them using the `&` operator. Here is the correct definition:

```typescript
type FruitsAndColors = {
  [key in fruit]: number;
} & {
  [key in color]: boolean;
}
```

This will create a type that has a numeric property for each fruit and a boolean property for each color.
