The issue is that you're using single quotes around your variable `$searchT` in the `grep` command. Single quotes in bash will prevent variable expansion, meaning that your variable `$searchT` is not being replaced with its value. 

You should use double quotes instead. Here's the corrected script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
read -p "enter search term here: " searchT

if [[ $(cat test.txt | grep -wi "$searchT") ]]; then     
    echo "$(cat test.txt | grep "$searchT" | wc -l) number of matches found"
    echo $(cat test.txt | grep "$searchT")

else 
    echo "no match found"    

fi

exit 0
```

In this script, `$searchT` will be correctly replaced with the value entered by the user. Also, I moved `wc -l` to only count the lines from the grep command, not the entire file.
