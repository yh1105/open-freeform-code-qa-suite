The error message you're seeing indicates that the directory you're trying to create (`/data/db`) is on a read-only file system. On macOS, the root directory `/` is read-only by default starting from macOS Catalina (10.15) due to the introduction of a new volume system.

Here are a few alternatives:

1. **Create the directory in your home directory**. This is the simplest solution. You can create the directory in your home directory (e.g., `~/data/db`) where you have write permissions:

    ```bash
    mkdir -p ~/data/db
    ```

2. **Use the `/Users/Shared` directory**. If you need a location that's accessible to all users, you can use the `/Users/Shared` directory:

    ```bash
    sudo mkdir -p /Users/Shared/data/db
    ```

3. **Disable the read-only restriction**. This is not recommended because it can potentially harm your system, but if you really need to create the directory at `/data/db`, you can disable the read-only restriction. Be aware that this is risky and could cause problems with your system:

    ```bash
    sudo mount -uw /
    sudo mkdir /data/db
    ```

    After creating the directory, you should re-enable the read-only restriction:

    ```bash
    sudo mount -ur /
    ```

Remember to update your MongoDB configuration to point to the new data directory if you're creating this directory for MongoDB.
