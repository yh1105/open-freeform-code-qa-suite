There could be several reasons why you're unable to start a Jupyter notebook on VS Code. Here are some steps you can take to troubleshoot the issue:

1. **Check your Python interpreter**: Make sure you're using the correct Python interpreter for your Jupyter notebook. You can select the interpreter by clicking on the Python version in the bottom-left corner of the VS Code window.

2. **Check your Jupyter and ipykernel installation**: Make sure you have Jupyter and ipykernel installed in the Python environment you're using. You can check this by running the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
conda activate da38
python -m pip show jupyter
python -m pip show ipykernel
```

If Jupyter or ipykernel is not installed, you can install them using the following commands:

```bash
conda activate da38
python -m pip install jupyter ipykernel
```

3. **Check your Jupyter server logs**: If you're still having issues, you can check the Jupyter server logs for any error messages. To do this, you can start Jupyter from the command line using the following command:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Then, try to connect to the Jupyter server from VS Code and check the command line output for any error messages.

4. **Reinstall the Python extension**: If all else fails, you can try reinstalling the Python extension in VS Code. To do this, go to the Extensions view (Ctrl+Shift+X), find the Python extension, click on the gear icon, and select Uninstall. After uninstalling, click on the Install button to reinstall the extension.

If none of these steps solve your problem, it might be a bug in VS Code or the Python extension. In this case, you can report the issue on the [VS Code GitHub page](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues) or the [Python extension GitHub page](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-python/issues).
