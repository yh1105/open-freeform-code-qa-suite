Sure, here is a bash script that uses `brew` to install a specific version of Python:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Unlink the current python version
brew unlink python

# Install the required python version
brew install python@3.6

# Link the installed python version
brew link --force python@3.6
```

Please replace `3.6` with `3.6.5` if you want to install Python 3.6.5 specifically. However, please note that `brew` might not have every minor version available.
