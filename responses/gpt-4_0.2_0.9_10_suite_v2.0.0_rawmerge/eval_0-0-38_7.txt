Sure, you should move the `console.log(this.newIds);` inside the subscribe method to ensure it runs after the response is received. Here is the revised code:

```javascript
this.repository.getById(Ids).subscribe((response) => {
  console.log(response);
  this.newIds = response.map((id) => {
    return id;
  });
  console.log(this.newIds);
});
```
This way, `console.log(this.newIds);` will wait until the response is received and `this.newIds` is updated.
