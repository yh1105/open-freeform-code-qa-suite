In C++, there is no built-in syntax for string interpolation like in C# or JavaScript. However, you can achieve a similar effect using `std::stringstream` or `std::to_string` function.

Here is an example using `std::stringstream`:

```cpp
#include <sstream>

int myVariable = 123;
std::stringstream ss;
ss << "My variable has value " << myVariable;
std::string result = ss.str();
```

And here is an example using `std::to_string`:

```cpp
int myVariable = 123;
std::string result = "My variable has value " + std::to_string(myVariable);
```

If you want a more modern and convenient way, you can use the `fmt` library (which is part of C++20 standard library), which allows Python-like string formatting:

```cpp
#include <fmt/core.h>

int myVariable = 123;
std::string result = fmt::format("My variable has value {}", myVariable);
```

Please note that the `fmt` library is not part of the standard library in C++ versions prior to C++20. If you're using an older version of C++, you'll need to install it separately.
