Yes, you can modify the CSS of Firefox's user interface to reduce the spacing between menu items. Here's how you can do it:

1. Open your Firefox profile folder. You can do this by typing `about:support` in the address bar and then clicking on "Open Folder" next to "Profile Folder".

2. In the profile folder, create a new folder named `chrome` if it doesn't exist already.

3. Inside the `chrome` folder, create a new file named `userChrome.css`. If the file already exists, you can just edit it.

4. Open `userChrome.css` with a text editor and add the following CSS code:

```css
/* Reduce padding on menus */
menupopup > menuitem, menupopup > menu {
    padding-block: 4px !important;
}
```

5. Save the file and close it.

6. Now, you need to tell Firefox to use your custom CSS. Type `about:config` in the address bar and press Enter. Accept the risk and continue.

7. In the search bar on the `about:config` page, type `toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets` and set its value to `true` by clicking on the toggle button.

8. Restart Firefox for the changes to take effect.

This CSS reduces the padding around menu items, which should make the spacing between them smaller. You can adjust the `4px` value to something that suits your preference. 

Please note that modifying Firefox's internal CSS might have unintended side effects and might not be supported in future versions of Firefox.
