The error `bad CPU type in executable` usually occurs when you're trying to run an application that isn't compatible with the architecture of your Mac's processor. This is a common issue with MacOS Catalina, as it dropped support for 32-bit applications.

The `pdftk` tool is one of the applications that has not been updated to support 64-bit processing, hence the error.

Here's a workaround to get `pdftk` working on your Mac:

1. Uninstall the current version of `pdftk` if you have it installed.

```bash
brew uninstall pdftk
```

2. Install `pdftk-java` which is a reimplementation of `pdftk` in Java. It's compatible with MacOS Catalina.

```bash
brew install pdftk-java
```

3. Create a symbolic link to `pdftk-java` in `/usr/local/bin` so you can use `pdftk` command directly.

```bash
ln -s /usr/local/bin/pdftk-java /usr/local/bin/pdftk
```

Now, you should be able to use `pdftk` command as usual.

Please note that you need to have Java installed on your Mac to use `pdftk-java`. If you don't have it installed, you can install it via Homebrew:

```bash
brew cask install java
```

If you still encounter issues, please let me know.
