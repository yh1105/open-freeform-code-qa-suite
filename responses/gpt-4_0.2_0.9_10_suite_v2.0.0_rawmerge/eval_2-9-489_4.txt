The warning you're seeing is because Elasticsearch 7.13.1 has built-in security features that are not enabled. Without these security features, your Elasticsearch cluster could be accessible to anyone.

To fix this, you need to enable the built-in security features of Elasticsearch. Here's how you can do it:

1. Open your `elasticsearch.yml` configuration file. This file is usually located in the `/etc/elasticsearch` or `/usr/local/etc/elasticsearch` directory.

2. Add the following lines to the file:

    ```yml
    xpack.security.enabled: true
    xpack.security.transport.ssl.enabled: true
    ```

3. Save the file and restart Elasticsearch.

Please note that enabling security will require all Elasticsearch clients to authenticate. You'll need to create users and roles, and configure your clients to use them. You can find more information on how to do this in the [Elasticsearch documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.13/security-minimal-setup.html).

If you don't want to enable security, you can suppress the warning by adding the following line to your `elasticsearch.yml` file:

```yml
xpack.security.enabled: false
```

Again, save the file and restart Elasticsearch. This will disable the built-in security features and suppress the warning, but it will also leave your Elasticsearch cluster accessible to anyone.
