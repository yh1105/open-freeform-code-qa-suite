The error message you're seeing is due to a change in the pandas library. The `join_axes` parameter was deprecated in pandas 0.25 and removed in pandas 1.0. 

The `pandas_profiling` library you're using seems to be not compatible with your current pandas version. You can try to downgrade your pandas version or upgrade your `pandas_profiling` library.

To upgrade `pandas_profiling` library, you can use the following command:

```bash
pip install --upgrade pandas-profiling
```

Or, if you're using conda:

```bash
conda update pandas-profiling
```

If you still encounter the same error after upgrading, you might want to consider downgrading your pandas version to 0.25.3:

```bash
pip install pandas==0.25.3
```

Or, if you're using conda:

```bash
conda install pandas=0.25.3
```

After downgrading pandas, your code should work as expected.

If you still want to use pandas 1.0 or later, you can use the `pandas_profiling` library version 2.6.0 or later, which is compatible with pandas 1.0 and later.
