Sure, I can help you with that. You can use Tailwind CSS to create a hover effect. Here's how you can modify your code:

```html
<a href="#" class="group relative text-sky-600 transition duration-300">
    Link
    <span class="absolute left-0 w-full h-0.5 bg-sky-600 transform scale-x-0 group-hover:scale-x-100 transition-transform duration-500"></span>
</a>
```

In this code, I've made the following changes:

1. Added `relative` to the link to position the span relative to the link.
2. Added `absolute` and `left-0` to the span to position it at the bottom of the link.
3. Added `transform scale-x-0` to the span to initially hide it.
4. Added `group-hover:scale-x-100` to the span to show it when the link is hovered.
5. Added `transition-transform` to the span to animate the transform property.

Please note that you need to enable `group-hover` and `transition-transform` variants in your Tailwind CSS configuration. If you haven't done this, you can do it by adding the following code to your `tailwind.config.js` file:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  variants: {
    extend: {
      transform: ['group-hover'],
      scale: ['group-hover'],
    },
  },
  plugins: [],
}
```

This will enable the `group-hover` variant for the `transform` and `scale` utilities.
