Unfortunately, Excel VBA doesn't have a built-in function to directly retrieve the local path of a file synced from OneDrive or SharePoint. However, you can use a workaround by using the `Environ` function in VBA to get the local OneDrive path and then append your relative file path to it.

Here is a simple example:

```vba
Sub GetOneDrivePath()

    Dim OneDrivePath As String
    OneDrivePath = Environ("OneDrive")
    
    ' Append your relative file path
    OneDrivePath = OneDrivePath & "\Your\Relative\Path"
    
    MsgBox OneDrivePath

End Sub
```

This will return the local OneDrive path. You can then append your relative file path to it. Note that this will only work if the OneDrive client is installed and the user is signed in.

As for creating folders and files on SharePoint using VBA, it's a bit more complicated due to the need to authenticate and interact with SharePoint's API. You might want to consider using SharePoint's REST API or CSOM (Client Side Object Model) for this, but it would require a good understanding of these technologies and might not be feasible depending on your environment and constraints. 

Another alternative could be to use Power Automate (formerly Microsoft Flow) to automate the process of creating folders and files on SharePoint. This would require no code, but would require a subscription to the service.
