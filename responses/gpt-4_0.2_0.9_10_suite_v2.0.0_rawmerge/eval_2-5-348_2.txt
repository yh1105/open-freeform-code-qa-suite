The error message suggests that there is a problem with the command you are trying to run, specifically that there is a malformed argument with an embedded quote. 

This is likely due to the way the command is being interpreted by the command line. 

Here's a revised version of your command that might work:

```bash
cd C:\projects\open && set "JAVA_HOME=C:\\Program Files\\Java\\jdk-11.0.5" && "C:\\Program Files\\NetBeans-11.1\\netbeans\\java\\maven\\bin\\mvn.cmd" -DskipTests=true -Dmaven.ext.class.path="C:\\Program Files\\NetBeans-11.1\\netbeans\\java\\maven-nblib\\netbeans-eventspy.jar" -Dfile.encoding=UTF-8 clean install
```

In this version, I've replaced the semicolon (`;`) with double ampersand (`&&`). The `&&` operator runs the second command only if the first command is successful. This ensures that the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable is set before the `mvn.cmd` command is run.

If you still encounter issues, you might want to check the following:

1. Ensure that the paths in the command are correct and that the files exist at those locations.
2. Check that you have the necessary permissions to run the command and access the files and directories in the command.
3. Make sure that the JDK and NetBeans are correctly installed and configured.
