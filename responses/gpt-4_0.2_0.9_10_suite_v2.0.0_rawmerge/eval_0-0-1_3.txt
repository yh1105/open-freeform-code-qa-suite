It's hard to provide a specific solution without seeing your code, but I can give you some general advice on how to troubleshoot this issue.

1. **Check your build output:** When you run `yarn run build`, Next.js should generate a `.next` directory with your built application. Check this directory to make sure that all of your pages are being correctly generated. If some pages are missing, there may be an issue with your dynamic routes.

2. **Check your dynamic routes:** Dynamic routes in Next.js should be named with bracket syntax, like `[id].js` for a dynamic `id` parameter. Make sure that your dynamic routes are correctly named and that you're using the `getStaticPaths` and `getStaticProps` functions correctly to generate your dynamic pages at build time.

3. **Check your `package.json` scripts:** Vercel uses the `build` and `start` scripts in your `package.json` to build and serve your application. Make sure that these scripts are correctly configured to build and start your Next.js app. For a Next.js app, these scripts should look something like this:

    ```json
    "scripts": {
      "dev": "next dev",
      "build": "next build",
      "start": "next start"
    }
    ```

4. **Check your Vercel settings:** Make sure that your Vercel project is correctly configured to build your Next.js app. In your Vercel project settings, the Build Command should be `yarn run build` (or `npm run build` if you're using npm), and the Output Directory should be `.next`.

5. **Check your Vercel deployment logs:** When you deploy your app to Vercel, it should provide you with logs of the build process. Check these logs for any error messages that might indicate what's going wrong.

6. **Create a `next.config.js` file:** Although it's not required, a `next.config.js` file can be useful for customizing the behavior of your Next.js app. If you're having trouble with your deployment, you might try creating a `next.config.js` file and seeing if that helps.

If none of these steps help, you might consider creating a minimal reproduction of your issue and asking for help on the Next.js GitHub issues page or on a platform like Stack Overflow.
