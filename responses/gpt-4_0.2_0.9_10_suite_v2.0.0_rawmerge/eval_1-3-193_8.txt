The error message suggests that Selenium can't find the Firefox binary on its default location. This can be due to several reasons:

1. Firefox is not installed on your machine.
2. Firefox is installed but not in the default location.

Here are some solutions:

1. **Install Firefox**: If Firefox is not installed on your machine, you should download and install it.

2. **Provide the path to Firefox binary**: If Firefox is installed but not in the default location, you need to provide the path to the Firefox binary in your script. Here is how you can do it:

```python
from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.firefox.service import Service
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By
from selenium.webdriver.firefox.options import Options
from webdriver_manager.firefox import GeckoDriverManager

options = Options()
options.binary_location = "/path/to/your/firefox/binary" # replace with your path
driver = webdriver.Firefox(service=Service(GeckoDriverManager().install()), options=options)
driver.get('http://www.seleniumhq.org')
```

Replace `"/path/to/your/firefox/binary"` with the actual path to your Firefox binary.

3. **Use WebDriverManager**: If you are not sure about the Firefox binary location or if you want your script to work on different machines without worrying about the Firefox installation path, you can use `WebDriverManager` which can download and manage the driver binary for you. Here is how you can do it:

```python
from selenium import webdriver
from webdriver_manager.firefox import GeckoDriverManager

driver = webdriver.Firefox(executable_path=GeckoDriverManager().install())
driver.get('http://www.seleniumhq.org')
```

In this case, `WebDriverManager` will automatically download the latest version of the Firefox driver (geckodriver), store it in a `.wdm` directory under your home directory, and return the path to the driver binary which is then passed to `webdriver.Firefox()`.
