The warning is because Dart's null safety feature is enabled. The `Map` operator `[]` returns a nullable type because the key might not exist in the map. 

You can solve this by either checking if the value is not null before assigning it to `s`, or by using the null assertion operator `!` to tell Dart that you're sure the value won't be null at that point.

Here's how you can do it:

```dart
void foo(Map<int, String> myMap) {
  if (myMap.containsKey(1)) {
    String? s = myMap[1];
    if (s != null) {
      // Do something with s
    }
  }
}
```

Or with null assertion:

```dart
void foo(Map<int, String> myMap) {
  if (myMap.containsKey(1)) {
    String s = myMap[1]!;
    // Do something with s
  }
}
```

Remember, using the null assertion operator `!` will throw an exception at runtime if the value is null. So, use it only when you're sure the value won't be null.
