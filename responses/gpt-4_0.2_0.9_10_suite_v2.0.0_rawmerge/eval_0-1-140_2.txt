Font Awesome 5 has changed a bit in how it's used compared to Font Awesome 4. The `font-family` is now separated into three different families: `Font Awesome 5 Free`, `Font Awesome 5 Brands`, and `Font Awesome 5 Pro`. The `content` values have also changed for some icons.

The `f107` content value corresponds to the `angle-down` icon in Font Awesome 4. In Font Awesome 5, the `angle-down` icon is still represented by `f107`, but you need to use the correct `font-family`.

Here is how you can update your CSS for Font Awesome 5:

```css
#mainNav .navbar-collapse .navbar-sidenav .nav-link-collapse:after {
  float: right;
  content: "\f107";
  font-family: "Font Awesome 5 Free";
  font-weight: 900; /* Use this for solid icons (fas), for regular (far) use 400, for light (fal) use 300 */
}
```

Remember to include the Font Awesome 5 CSS in your project:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://use.fontawesome.com/releases/v5.0.13/css/all.css">
```

Also, make sure that you are using the correct version of Font Awesome 5, as the `content` values can change between versions.
