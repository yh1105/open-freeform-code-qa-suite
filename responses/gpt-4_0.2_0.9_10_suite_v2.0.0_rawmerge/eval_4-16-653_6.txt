You can use the `date` command in Unix to convert the date format. Here is a simple script that reads each line from the file and converts the date:

```bash
while IFS= read -r line
do
    date -d "${line:0:10}" +"%d %b %Y"
done < filename.txt
```

This script reads the file line by line. For each line, it extracts the date part (ignoring the time and timezone), converts it to the desired format, and prints it. 

Please replace `filename.txt` with your actual file name.
