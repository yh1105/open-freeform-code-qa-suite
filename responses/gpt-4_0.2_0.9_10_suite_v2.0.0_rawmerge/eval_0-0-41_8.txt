The `navigator.geolocation` object is available in most modern browsers, but it doesn't necessarily mean that the user has granted permission to access their location. The `getCurrentPosition` method is asynchronous and takes two callback functions as arguments: the first one is called when the location is successfully retrieved, and the second one is called when an error occurs.

You should handle the error case in the second callback function. Here is how you can modify your code:

```javascript
if (navigator.geolocation) {
    navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(
        position => {
            console.log("Location accessed");
        },
        error => {
            console.log("User not allowed");
        }
    );
} else {
    console.log("Geolocation is not supported by this browser.");
}
```

In this code, if the user denies access to their location, the error callback will be called, and "User not allowed" will be logged to the console. If the geolocation object is not available at all (which could be the case in some older browsers), "Geolocation is not supported by this browser." will be logged to the console.
