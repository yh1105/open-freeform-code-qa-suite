Yes, you can modify the internal CSS of Firefox to adjust the spacing between menu items. Here's how you can do it:

1. Open your Firefox profile folder. You can do this by typing `about:support` in the address bar and then clicking on `Open Folder` next to `Profile Folder`.

2. In the profile folder, create a new folder named `chrome` if it doesn't exist.

3. Inside the `chrome` folder, create a new file named `userChrome.css`. If the file already exists, open it.

4. Paste the following CSS code into the `userChrome.css` file:

    ```css
    :root {
        --proton-toolbar-dense-height: 29px !important;
        --proton-toolbar-regular-height: 33px !important;
        --proton-toolbar-touch-height: 37px !important;
        --proton-menupopup-item-height: 25px !important;
    }
    ```

    This code reduces the height of the toolbar and menu items. You can adjust the pixel values to your liking.

5. Save the `userChrome.css` file and close it.

6. Now, you need to enable the usage of this file in Firefox. Type `about:config` in the address bar and press Enter.

7. Click on `Accept the Risk and Continue`.

8. In the search bar, type `toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets` and set its value to `true` by clicking on the toggle button.

9. Restart Firefox for the changes to take effect.

Please note that modifying internal files can potentially lead to unexpected behavior in Firefox. Always make a backup of your profile folder before making any changes.
