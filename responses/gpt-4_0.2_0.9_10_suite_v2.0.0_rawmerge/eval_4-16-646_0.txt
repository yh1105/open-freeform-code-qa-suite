The error `bad CPU type in executable` is typically seen when you're trying to run a 32-bit application on macOS Catalina or later, which only supports 64-bit applications.

Unfortunately, the original `pdftk` is a 32-bit application and is not supported on macOS Catalina or later. However, there is a fork of `pdftk` called `pdftk-java` which is a 64-bit application and can be run on macOS Catalina or later.

Here are the steps to install `pdftk-java`:

1. First, you need to install Homebrew if you haven't already. Open Terminal and paste the following command:

    ```bash
    /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
    ```

2. Once Homebrew is installed, you can install `pdftk-java` by running:

    ```bash
    brew install pdftk-java
    ```

3. After the installation, you can use `pdftk-java` just like you would use `pdftk`. However, you need to replace `pdftk` with `pdftk-java` in your commands.

For example, if you previously used:

```bash
pdftk input.pdf output output.pdf
```

You would now use:

```bash
pdftk-java input.pdf output output.pdf
```

If you want to use the `pdftk` command instead of `pdftk-java`, you can create a symbolic link:

```bash
ln -s /usr/local/bin/pdftk-java /usr/local/bin/pdftk
```

Now you should be able to use `pdftk` command as before.
