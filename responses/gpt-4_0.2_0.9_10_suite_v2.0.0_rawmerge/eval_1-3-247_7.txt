The error message is indicating that Django is trying to reverse the URL for 'profile' with an empty string as an argument, but it can't find a match. This is happening because `post.author.username` is empty for at least one of your posts.

In your `index.html` file, you have this line:

```html
<a href="{% url 'profile' post.author.username %}">
```

This line is trying to create a URL for the profile of the author of each post. If `post.author.username` is empty, Django will try to reverse `profile` with an empty string, which leads to the error you're seeing.

To fix this, you need to ensure that every post has an author with a username. You can do this by adding a check in your view before saving a new post:

```python
if request.user.is_authenticated:
    post = NewPost(title=title, description=description, author=request.user)
    post.save()
```

This will ensure that only authenticated users (who should have a username) can create posts.

You could also add a check in your template to only create the link if the username exists:

```html
{% if post.author.username %}
    <a href="{% url 'profile' post.author.username %}">
        @{{post.author.username}}
    </a>
{% endif %}
```

This will prevent the error from occurring, but it won't fix the underlying issue of posts without authors.
