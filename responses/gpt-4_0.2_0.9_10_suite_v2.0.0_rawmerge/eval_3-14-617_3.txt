This error can occur due to a variety of reasons. Here are a few things you can try:

1. **Check your build phases**: Go to your target, then to the "Build Phases" tab. Check if there's any script in the "Run Script" section that's causing the error. If there is, try to fix the script or remove it if it's not necessary.

2. **Check your podfile**: Make sure all your pods are installed correctly. Try running `pod deintegrate` and then `pod install` again.

3. **Check your signing certificates**: This error can sometimes occur due to issues with your signing certificates. Go to "Keychain Access", find your certificate, right click and select "Get Info", then expand "Trust" and set "When using this certificate" to "Use System Defaults".

4. **Clean and rebuild**: Try cleaning your project (Cmd + Shift + K), deleting derived data, and then rebuilding.

5. **Update Xcode**: If none of the above work, try updating Xcode to the latest version.

6. **Check your Swift version**: Make sure your Swift version is compatible with the pods you're using. For example, `IQKeyboardManagerSwift` requires Swift 5.0 or later.

If none of these solutions work, please provide more details about your problem, such as the complete error message and your Xcode version.
