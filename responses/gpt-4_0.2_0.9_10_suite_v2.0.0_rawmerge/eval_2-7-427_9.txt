For the CSRF token mismatch error, it could be due to a variety of reasons. Here are a few things you could check:

1. **Domain Configuration**: Ensure that your domain is correctly configured to point to the public directory of your Laravel application. Misconfiguration could lead to issues with session handling.

2. **Cookie Domain**: If your application is under a subdomain, you might need to set the `SESSION_DOMAIN` in your `.env` file to your root domain. For example, if your application is at `app.example.com`, you should set `SESSION_DOMAIN=.example.com`.

3. **Secure Cookies**: If your application is not served over HTTPS, but the `SESSION_SECURE_COOKIE` is set to `true`, it could cause issues. Try setting `SESSION_SECURE_COOKIE=false` in your `.env` file.

4. **Session Driver**: If you're using a driver other than `file` for sessions, ensure that it's correctly configured and working as expected.

For the email sending issue, the error message suggests that there's a problem with the SSL configuration. Here are a few things you could try:

1. **Encryption Method**: Try changing `MAIL_ENCRYPTION` from `ssl` to `tls` in your `.env` file.

2. **Port Number**: The port number `587` is typically used with `tls`. If you're using `ssl`, you might need to change the `MAIL_PORT` to `465`.

3. **Server Configuration**: There could be an issue with the mail server configuration. You might need to contact the server administrator or the service provider for assistance.

4. **OpenSSL Version**: The error message suggests that there could be an issue with the OpenSSL version. You might need to update OpenSSL on your server.

Remember to clear the configuration cache using `php artisan config:cache` after making changes to the `.env` file.
