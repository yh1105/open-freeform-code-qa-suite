The error you're seeing is because the 'year' column contains float values represented as strings, and you're trying to convert them directly to integers. Python's `int()` function doesn't handle float strings well, hence the error.

You can solve this by first converting the strings to floats, and then converting the floats to integers. Here's how you can do it:

```python
def transformation(data_h_df):
    data_h_df['year'] = data_h_df['year'].astype(float).astype(int)
    return data_h_df
```

This function first converts the 'year' column to floats, and then to integers. This should solve your problem.
