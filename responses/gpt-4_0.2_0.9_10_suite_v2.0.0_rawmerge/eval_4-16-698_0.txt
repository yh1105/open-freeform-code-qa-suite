You can use the `source` command to reload your `.bash_profile` without closing and reopening your terminal. Here's how:

```bash
source ~/.bash_profile
```

This command will read and execute commands from the filename argument in the current shell context. If you made changes to your `.bash_profile`, it will apply those changes to your current terminal session.

Alternatively, you can use the `.` command, which is equivalent to `source`:

```bash
. ~/.bash_profile
```

Both of these commands will only affect the current terminal session. If you open a new terminal window or tab, you'll need to source `.bash_profile` again in that new window or tab.
