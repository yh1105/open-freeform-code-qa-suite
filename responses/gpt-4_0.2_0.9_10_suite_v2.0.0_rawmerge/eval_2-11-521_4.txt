The comment is partially correct. 

A constructor is indeed a special method in a class that is automatically invoked when a new object of that class is created. Its main purpose is to initialize the newly created object.

However, saying "a constructor cannot be called, it is not a function" is not entirely accurate. In many programming languages, such as JavaScript, a constructor is a special type of function that is used to initialize new objects. You can't call it like a regular function, but it is still a function.

So, the user is correct in saying that a constructor is invoked automatically when a new object is created, but it's not accurate to say that a constructor is not a function. It's more accurate to say that a constructor is a special type of function that can't be called in the same way as a regular function.
