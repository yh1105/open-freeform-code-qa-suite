If you're using GitHub Actions, you can use the `actions/setup-java` action to specify the version of Java you want to use. This action will download and set up a particular version of a Java distribution. You can specify the version using the `java-version` input.

Here's an example of how you can use it:

```yaml
name: Java CI

on: [push]

jobs:
  build:

    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Set up JDK 1.8
      uses: actions/setup-java@v2
      with:
        distribution: 'adopt'
        java-version: '8'
    - name: Build with Maven
      run: ./mvnw clean install
```

In this example, the `actions/setup-java` action is used to set up AdoptOpenJDK 8 before running the Maven wrapper command.

If you're using a different CI/CD system, the way to specify the Java version might be different. Please refer to the documentation of your specific system for more information.

If you're running this on your local machine, you can use a version manager like SDKMAN or jEnv to switch between different versions of Java.
