You're on the right track, but the syntax for defining an array of objects in TypeScript is slightly different. You should define the type of the object first, and then specify that the parameter is an array of that type. Here's how you can do it:

```typescript
bagTotal = (products: {name: string, price: number, description: string}[]) => {
 // function does stuff
}
```

In this case, `{name: string, price: number, description: string}[]` is the type of the `products` parameter, which is an array of objects. Each object has a `name` property of type `string`, a `price` property of type `number`, and a `description` property of type `string`.
