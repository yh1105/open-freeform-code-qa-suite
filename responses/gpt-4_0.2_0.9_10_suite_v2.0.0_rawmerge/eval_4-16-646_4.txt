The error you're seeing is due to the fact that MacOS Catalina dropped support for 32-bit applications, and `pdftk` is one of them. 

You can solve this issue by using `pdftk-java` which is a reimplementation of `pdftk` in Java. You can install it via Homebrew:

1. If you haven't installed Homebrew yet, you can do so by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

2. Once Homebrew is installed, you can install `pdftk-java` by running:

```bash
brew install pdftk-java
```

3. After installation, you can use `pdftk-java` in the same way as `pdftk`. However, you need to call it as `pdftk-java` instead of `pdftk`. If you want to use `pdftk` command instead of `pdftk-java`, you can create a symlink:

```bash
ln -s /usr/local/bin/pdftk-java /usr/local/bin/pdftk
```

Now, you should be able to use `pdftk` command in your terminal.
