In Rust, `Box<T>` is a smart pointer that points to data on the heap. It cannot be null. If you want to have an optional `Box<T>`, you should use `Option<Box<T>>`. 

In your case, you can modify your `Node` and `Stack` structs to use `Option<Box<Node>>` for `next` and `top` respectively. Then, you can check if the `Box<Node>` is `None` (which would be equivalent to a null pointer in languages that have them).

Here's how you can modify your structs:

```rust
struct Node {
    value: i32,
    next: Option<Box<Node>>,
}

struct Stack {
    top: Option<Box<Node>>,
}
```

Now, you can check if `top` is `None` like this:

```rust
if let Some(top_node) = &stack.top {
    // top is not None, do something with top_node
} else {
    // top is None
}
```

Or you can use `is_none()` or `is_some()` methods:

```rust
if stack.top.is_none() {
    // top is None
}

if stack.top.is_some() {
    // top is not None
}
```

Remember that in Rust, `Option<T>` is used to represent optional values and is a safer alternative to null pointers found in other languages. It forces you to handle the case when the value might be `None`, preventing null pointer dereference bugs.
