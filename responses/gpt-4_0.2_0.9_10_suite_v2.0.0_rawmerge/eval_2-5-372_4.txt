Yes, it seems like a dependency conflict. The error message indicates that Hibernate Validator 5.3.5.Final-redhat-2 is being used, but `@NotEmpty` and `@NotBlank` annotations are not supported until Hibernate Validator 6.0.0.Final.

The `spring-boot-starter-parent` version 2.0.4.RELEASE you are using includes Hibernate Validator 6.0.11.Final, which should support `@NotEmpty` and `@NotBlank` annotations. However, it seems like JBoss is using its own bundled Hibernate Validator 5.3.5.Final-redhat-2 instead of the one provided by Spring Boot.

To solve this issue, you can try to exclude the Hibernate Validator from JBoss and use the one from your application. You can do this by creating a `jboss-deployment-structure.xml` file in your `src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/` directory with the following content:

```xml
<jboss-deployment-structure>
    <deployment>
        <exclusions>
            <module name="org.hibernate.validator" />
        </exclusions>
    </deployment>
</jboss-deployment-structure>
```

This file tells JBoss to exclude its own Hibernate Validator module and use the one provided by your application. After creating this file, rebuild your application and redeploy it to JBoss.
