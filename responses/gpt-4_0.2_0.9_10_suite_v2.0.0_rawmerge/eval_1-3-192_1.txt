Here is a Python function that uses the `re` module to replace dashes and underscores with the next character in uppercase:

```python
import re

def to_camel_case(text):
    return re.sub(r'[_-](.)', lambda x: x.group(1).upper(), text)
```

This function works by using a regular expression to find all occurrences of a dash or underscore followed by any character (`[_-](.)`). The `re.sub` function then replaces each match with the result of the lambda function, which is the character following the dash or underscore, converted to uppercase (`x.group(1).upper()`).

Let's test this function with the provided test cases:

```python
print(to_camel_case(''))  # Expected: ''
print(to_camel_case("the_stealth_warrior"))  # Expected: "theStealthWarrior"
print(to_camel_case("The-Stealth-Warrior"))  # Expected: "TheStealthWarrior"
print(to_camel_case("A-B-C"))  # Expected: "ABC"
```

This function should work for any string that contains words separated by dashes or underscores. It will not modify any other characters in the string.
