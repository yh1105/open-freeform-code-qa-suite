The code you've provided seems correct. However, the issue might be that you're not observing the changes in the `isSelected` variable in the parent view that uses `ContentView`. 

In SwiftUI, `@Binding` is a way to create a two-way connection between the variable and the view. When the variable changes, the view invalidates its appearance and recomputes the `body`. But if the parent view doesn't observe this variable, it won't redraw the `ContentView`.

Here's an example of how you can use `ContentView`:

```swift
struct ParentView: View {
    @State var isSelected: Bool = false

    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            ContentView(isSelected: $isSelected)
            Text(isSelected ? "Selected" : "Not Selected")
        }
    }
}
```

In this example, `ParentView` will also update when `isSelected` changes because it observes the `@State` variable.
