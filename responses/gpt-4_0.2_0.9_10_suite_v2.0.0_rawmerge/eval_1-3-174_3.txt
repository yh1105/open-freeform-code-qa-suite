The error message `ImportError: DLL load failed while importing _psycopg: The operating system cannot run %1.` suggests that there is a problem with the psycopg2 installation. This could be due to a variety of reasons, such as a missing or incompatible library.

Here are a few things you could try:

1. **Reinstall psycopg2-binary**: Instead of using psycopg2, try installing psycopg2-binary which is a stand-alone package and does not require any other dependencies. You can install it using pip:

    ```bash
    pip uninstall psycopg2
    pip install psycopg2-binary
    ```

2. **Check your Python version**: Make sure you are using a Python version that is compatible with the psycopg2 version you are trying to install. You can check your Python version by running `python --version` in your command line.

3. **Check your PostgreSQL version**: Make sure you are using a PostgreSQL version that is compatible with the psycopg2 version you are trying to install.

4. **Check your system's PATH**: Make sure your system's PATH includes the directory where the psycopg2 DLLs are located. 

5. **Try a different Python environment**: If you are using Anaconda, try creating a new environment and installing psycopg2 there. If you are not using Anaconda, try installing it in a virtual environment.

If none of these suggestions work, please provide more information about your system (Python version, PostgreSQL version, etc.) so we can better assist you.
