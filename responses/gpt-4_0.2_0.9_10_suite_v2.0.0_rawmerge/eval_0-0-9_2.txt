The error message you're seeing is suggesting that `req.logout()` requires a callback function. However, according to the Passport.js documentation, `req.logout()` does not actually require a callback function.

The issue might be related to the session management or the order of middleware functions. 

Here's how you can modify your logout route:

```javascript
app.get("/logout", (req, res) => {
    req.session.destroy((err) => {
        res.redirect("/"); //Inside a callbackâ€¦ bulletproof!
    });
});
```

In this case, we're destroying the session and then redirecting the user to the home page. This ensures that the session is completely destroyed before the user is redirected. 

If you still want to use `req.logout()`, you can use it like this:

```javascript
app.get('/logout', function(req, res){
  req.logout();
  req.session.save(function(err){
    if(err){
      return next(err);
    }
    res.redirect('/');
  });
});
```

In this case, we're saving the session after calling `req.logout()`. This ensures that the logout action is completed before the user is redirected.
