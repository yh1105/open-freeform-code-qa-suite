Unfortunately, Excel VBA doesn't have a built-in function to retrieve the local path of a OneDrive or SharePoint file. However, you can use a workaround to get the local path of the synced SharePoint file.

Here's a simple VBA function that can convert a SharePoint or OneDrive URL to a local file path:

```vba
Function ConvertToLocalPath(SPUrl As String) As String
    Dim strLocalPath As String
    strLocalPath = Replace(SPUrl, "https://", "")
    strLocalPath = Replace(strLocalPath, "/", "\")
    strLocalPath = Environ("UserProfile") & "\OneDrive - YourCompanyName\" & strLocalPath
    ConvertToLocalPath = strLocalPath
End Function
```

You can use this function in your VBA code like this:

```vba
Sub Test()
    Dim SPUrl As String
    Dim LocalPath As String
    SPUrl = "https://YourCompanyName.sharepoint.com/Shared Documents/YourFileName.xlsx"
    LocalPath = ConvertToLocalPath(SPUrl)
    Debug.Print LocalPath
End Sub
```

Please replace "YourCompanyName" and "YourFileName.xlsx" with your actual company name and file name.

Please note that this function assumes that the OneDrive folder is located in the user's profile folder and the name of the OneDrive folder is "OneDrive - YourCompanyName". If this is not the case, you need to adjust the function accordingly.

Also, this function doesn't check if the file actually exists at the local path. You might want to add some error checking code to handle this situation.
