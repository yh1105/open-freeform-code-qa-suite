The error message you're seeing is indicating that `req.logout()` is expecting a callback function. However, in Passport.js, `req.logout()` does not actually require a callback function. 

The error might be due to some other middleware or plugin that is extending or modifying the `req.logout()` function. 

Your logout route seems to be correct. Here is the correct way to use `req.logout()`:

```javascript
app.get("/logout", (req, res) => {
    req.logout();
    res.redirect("/");
});
```

This should log the user out and then redirect them to the home page. 

If you're still seeing the error, I would recommend checking other parts of your code or your dependencies to see if something else is causing the issue. 

Also, ensure that the user is authenticated before they try to logout. If the user is not authenticated and they try to logout, it could potentially cause an error.
