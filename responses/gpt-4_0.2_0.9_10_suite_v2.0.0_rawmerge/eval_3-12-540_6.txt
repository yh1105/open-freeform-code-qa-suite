Yes, in Flutter, you can draw vertical lines between components using the `VerticalDivider` widget. Here is a simple example:

```dart
Row(
  children: <Widget>[
    Expanded(
      child: Text('Component 1'),
    ),
    const VerticalDivider(
      color: Colors.grey,
      thickness: 1,
      width: 20,
    ),
    Expanded(
      child: Text('Component 2'),
    ),
    const VerticalDivider(
      color: Colors.grey,
      thickness: 1,
      width: 20,
    ),
    Expanded(
      child: Text('Component 3'),
    ),
  ],
)
```

In this example, `VerticalDivider` is used to draw vertical lines between three text components. You can adjust the color, thickness, and width of the divider as per your needs. 

Please note that `VerticalDivider` is a widget that displays a one device pixel thick vertical line, with padding on either side. The line is always centered within the parent widget's height. It's best used within a `Row` widget.
