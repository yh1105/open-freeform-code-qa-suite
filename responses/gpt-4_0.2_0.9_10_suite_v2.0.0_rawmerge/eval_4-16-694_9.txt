You can use `awk` to extract the language code from the `lang` attribute. Here's how you can modify your command:

```bash
curl -Ls stick-it.app | grep -o 'lang="[a-zA-Z-]*"' | head -1 | awk -F'"' '{print $2}'
```

Here's what the command does:

- `curl -Ls stick-it.app`: Fetches the content of the page.
- `grep -o 'lang="[a-zA-Z-]*"'`: Searches for the `lang` attribute and its value. The `-o` option tells `grep` to only output the matched part of the line.
- `head -1`: Gets the first match.
- `awk -F'"' '{print $2}'`: Splits the line by the `"` character and prints the second field, which is the language code.

This command should work regardless of where the `lang` attribute is located in the `<html>` tag.
