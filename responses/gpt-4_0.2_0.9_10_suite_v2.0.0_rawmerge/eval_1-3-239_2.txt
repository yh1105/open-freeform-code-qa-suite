Sure, here is a simple bash script that will install a specific version of Python using Homebrew:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Unlink current Python
brew unlink python

# Install Python 3.6.5
brew install python@3.6

# Link Python 3.6.5
brew link --force python@3.6
```

Please note that this script will unlink your current version of Python and link Python 3.6.5 as the default Python version. If you want to switch back to the latest version, you will need to unlink Python 3.6.5 and link the latest version again.
