The error you're encountering is because you're trying to access platform-specific code before `runApp()` is called, which initializes the binding with the host platform. This is necessary to use platform channels, which is what `getApplicationDocumentsDirectory()` uses under the hood.

To fix this, you need to ensure that the Flutter engine is fully initialized before calling `getApplicationDocumentsDirectory()`. You can do this by calling `WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized()` before any other code in your `main()` function.

Here's how you can modify your code:

```dart
void main() async {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized(); // Add this line
  final appDocsDir = await getApplicationDocumentsDirectory();
  Hive.init(appDocsDir.path);
  runApp(MyApp());
}
```

This will ensure that the Flutter engine is ready before you try to access the application documents directory.
