The error message indicates that the SQLite database does not have a table named "Keys". This table is used by IdentityServer4 for key material storage.

When you upgrade to ASP.NET Core 6.0, you also need to migrate the database schema. You can do this by creating a migration and updating the database.

Here are the steps to do this:

1. First, install the necessary Entity Framework tools if you haven't already. You can do this by running the following command in your Package Manager Console:

```shell
dotnet tool install --global dotnet-ef
```

2. Next, navigate to the project directory where your `DbContext` is located.

3. Create a new migration. Replace `AppDbContext` with the name of your `DbContext` and `AddKeysTable` with the name you want to give to the migration:

```shell
dotnet ef migrations add AddKeysTable --context AppDbContext
```

4. Finally, update the database with the new migration:

```shell
dotnet ef database update --context AppDbContext
```

This will create the necessary `Keys` table in your SQLite database.

If you're still encountering issues, ensure that your `AppDbContext` is correctly configured and that the `Keys` table is included in your `DbContext`. If it's not, you'll need to add it:

```csharp
public DbSet<Key> Keys { get; set; }
```

Remember to replace `Key` with the actual model representing your `Keys` table.
