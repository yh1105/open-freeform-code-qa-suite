You can change the color of the accordion arrow by targeting the `::after` pseudo-element of the `.accordion-button` class. This is the element that Bootstrap uses to create the arrow. 

Here is the CSS code:

```css
.accordion-button:not(.collapsed)::after {
    /* This is the arrow when the accordion is expanded */
    color: green;
}

.accordion-button.collapsed::after {
    /* This is the arrow when the accordion is collapsed */
    color: green;
}
```

This CSS code will change the color of the arrow to green both when the accordion is expanded and when it is collapsed. 

Remember to include this CSS after the Bootstrap CSS in your HTML file, so it will override the default Bootstrap styles.
