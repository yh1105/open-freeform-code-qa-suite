To remove the spaces from your output, you can simply replace the space character with an empty string. You can do this by modifying the `Case Else` line in your code. Here's how you can do it:

```vba
Sub ReplaceSpecial()
    Dim cel As Range
    Dim strVal As String
    Dim i As Long
    Application.ScreenUpdating = False
    For Each cel In Selection
        strVal = cel.Value
        For i = 1 To Len(strVal)
            Select Case Asc(Mid(strVal, i, 1))
                Case 32, 48 To 57, 65 To 90, 97 To 122
                    ' Leave ordinary characters alone
                Case Else
                    Mid(strVal, i, 1) = ""
            End Select
        Next i
        cel.Value = strVal
    Next cel
    Application.ScreenUpdating = True
End Sub
```

However, this code will not work as expected because the `Mid` function in VBA does not allow to replace a character with an empty string. 

A better approach would be to build a new string with only the characters you want to keep. Here's how you can do it:

```vba
Sub ReplaceSpecial()
    Dim cel As Range
    Dim strVal As String
    Dim i As Long
    Dim newStr As String
    Application.ScreenUpdating = False
    For Each cel In Selection
        strVal = cel.Value
        newStr = ""
        For i = 1 To Len(strVal)
            Select Case Asc(Mid(strVal, i, 1))
                Case 48 To 57, 65 To 90, 97 To 122
                    newStr = newStr & Mid(strVal, i, 1)
            End Select
        Next i
        cel.Value = newStr
    Next cel
    Application.ScreenUpdating = True
End Sub
```

This code will create a new string (`newStr`) for each cell, and only add the characters to it that are numbers or letters. After it has checked all characters, it will replace the cell's value with the new string.
