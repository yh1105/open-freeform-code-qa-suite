Yes, there is a better way to do this in Rust. You can use the `?` operator to simplify the code. The `?` operator is used after an expression that returns `Option` or `Result`, and it works by returning the inner value if it is `Some` or `Ok`, and immediately returning from the current function if it is `None` or `Err`.

Here's how you can refactor your code:

```rust
fn main() {
    match process() {
        Ok(result) => {
            // Do something with result
        },
        Err(e) => println!("{}", e),
    }
}

fn process() -> Result<YourType, &'static str> {
    let i = func1().ok_or("func 1 returned None")?;
    let j = func2(i).ok_or("func 2 returned None")?;
    let k = func3(j).ok_or("func 3 returned None")?;
    let result = func4(k).ok_or("func 4 returned None")?;
    Ok(result)
}
```

In this refactored code, `process` is a new function that chains the calls to `func1`, `func2`, `func3`, and `func4` using the `?` operator. If any of these functions return `None`, the `?` operator will immediately return from `process` with an `Err` value that contains the appropriate error message. If all the functions return `Some`, `process` will return `Ok(result)`, where `result` is the value returned by `func4`.

Then, in `main`, you call `process` and match on its result. If it's `Ok`, you do something with the result. If it's `Err`, you print the error message.

This refactored code is much cleaner and easier to read than the original code. It also has a flatter structure and a more sensible order of operations.
