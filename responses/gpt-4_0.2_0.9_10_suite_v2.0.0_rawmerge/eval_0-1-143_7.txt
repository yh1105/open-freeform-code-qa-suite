You can modify the userChrome.css file to reduce the spacing between menu items in Firefox Proton. Here's how you can do it:

1. Open your Firefox profile folder. You can do this by typing `about:support` in the address bar and then clicking on `Open Folder` next to `Profile Folder`.

2. In the profile folder, create a new folder named `chrome` if it doesn't already exist.

3. Inside the `chrome` folder, create a new file named `userChrome.css`. If the file already exists, you can just edit it.

4. Open `userChrome.css` with a text editor and add the following lines:

```css
/* Reduce Menu and Contextual Menu height */
:root {
  --arrowpanel-menuitem-padding: 4px 8px !important;
}

menupopup > menuitem, menupopup > menu {
  padding-block: 4px !important;
}

/* Reduce height of URL and Search Bar */
#urlbar-input-container, #searchbar .searchbar-textbox {
  padding-block: 4px !important;
}
```

5. Save the file and restart Firefox.

This will reduce the spacing between menu items, as well as the height of the URL and search bar.

Please note that you need to enable the use of `userChrome.css` and `userContent.css` for this to work. You can do this by going to `about:config` in the address bar, search for `toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets` and set it to `true`.
