The error message `Unrecognized option: --add-opens` suggests that the Java version you're using does not recognize the `--add-opens` option. This option is used to relax the strong encapsulation of Java module system, and it's available from Java 9 onwards.

Hyperledger Besu requires Java 11 or later to run. The Java version you're currently using is 1.8 (or Java 8), which is why it doesn't recognize the `--add-opens` option and you're getting this error.

To resolve this issue, you need to install Java 11 or a later version. Here are the steps:

1. Download the appropriate JDK for your operating system from the [Oracle website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html) or [OpenJDK website](https://jdk.java.net/11/).

2. Install the JDK by following the instructions provided by the installer.

3. Verify the installation by opening a new command prompt and typing:

```shell
java -version
```

The output should show that you're now using Java 11 or later.

4. If the `java -version` command still shows the old version, you may need to set the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable to point to the new JDK installation directory and add the JDK's `bin` directory to the `PATH` environment variable. The steps to do this depend on your operating system.

After you've installed the correct version of Java, you should be able to run Hyperledger Besu without encountering the `Unrecognized option: --add-opens` error.
