The error you're encountering is likely due to a version mismatch between Devise and Rails. Devise 4.8.0 is not compatible with some older versions of Rails. 

Here are a few steps you can take to resolve this issue:

1. **Update Rails:** If you're using an older version of Rails, you might want to consider updating it. You can do this by changing the version in your Gemfile and running `bundle update rails`. 

    ```ruby
    gem 'rails', '~> 6.1.4'
    ```

    Then run:

    ```bash
    bundle update rails
    ```

2. **Use a compatible version of Devise:** If you can't update Rails, you might want to use a version of Devise that's compatible with your version of Rails. You can specify the version in your Gemfile like this:

    ```ruby
    gem 'devise', '~> 4.7.3'
    ```

    Then run:

    ```bash
    bundle update devise
    ```

3. **Check your Ruby version:** Devise 4.8.0 requires Ruby 2.5.0 or newer. If you're using an older version of Ruby, you'll need to update it.

Remember to restart your Rails server after making these changes.
