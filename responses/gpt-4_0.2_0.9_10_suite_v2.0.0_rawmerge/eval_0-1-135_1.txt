Yes, there is a known issue with Safari not respecting `height: auto` for images inside a flex container. This is because Safari has a different interpretation of the flexbox specification compared to other browsers.

To fix this issue, you can use `align-self: flex-start` on the image. This will align the image at the start of the cross axis, which is the vertical axis in your case since you're using `flex-direction: column`.

Here's how you can modify your CSS:

```css
.container {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
}

.container section:first-child {
  display: flex;
  margin-bottom: 25px;
}

.container img {
  width: 125px;
  height: auto;
  align-self: flex-start; /* Add this line */
}
```

This should make your images display correctly in Safari.
