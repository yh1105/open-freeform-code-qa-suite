The error message indicates that Go is unable to find the specific revision of the module `github.ibm.com/kms/key-protect-client` in your private repository. This could be due to a few reasons:

1. **Network Issues**: Ensure that computer B has a stable internet connection and can reach the private repository.

2. **Authentication Issues**: Even though your GitHub credentials give you access to these repos, Go might not be using them correctly. You can try setting the `GOPRIVATE` environment variable to tell Go to use direct mode for your private modules:

    ```bash
    export GOPRIVATE=github.ibm.com/kms
    ```

    This tells Go that any module that starts with `github.ibm.com/kms` is private and it should not use the proxy for those.

3. **Incorrect Version**: The version `v0.1.5` might not exist in your private repository. Double-check the repository to ensure that the version is correct.

4. **Go Proxy Settings**: If you're using a Go proxy, it might not have access to your private repository. You can bypass the proxy for your private modules by setting the `GOPRIVATE` or `GONOPROXY` environment variables.

    ```bash
    export GONOPROXY=github.ibm.com/kms
    ```

5. **Go Version**: Ensure that you're using the same version of Go on both computers. Different versions of Go might handle modules differently.

To debug this further, you can use the `-x` flag with `go build` to print out the commands that Go is executing:

```bash
go build -x
```

This might give you more information about what's going wrong.
