The error message is telling you that Vue.js prefers primitive values (strings or numbers) as keys in a `v-for` loop. In your case, you're using the entire `comment` object as the key, which is a non-primitive value.

To fix this, you should use a unique primitive value from each `comment` as the key. If each comment has a unique id, you could use that:

```html
<div v-for="comment in comments" :key="comment.id">
```

If there's no unique id, you could use the index of the loop:

```html
<div v-for="(comment, index) in comments" :key="index">
```

Remember that keys should be unique within the component's scope. This helps Vue.js track each node's identity, and it can be more efficient when updating the virtual DOM.
