The `rename` function is used to rename the columns or the index of a DataFrame. However, in your case, you are trying to rename the column of a Series object, not a DataFrame. The `groupby` function followed by `mean` returns a Series, not a DataFrame.

Here is the correct way to do it:

```python
def renameDataFrame(df):
    avg = df.groupby(["t"], sort=False)["p"].mean().reset_index()
    avg = avg.rename(columns={"p":"mean"})
    return avg
```

This function first groups the DataFrame `df` by the "t" column and calculates the mean of the "p" column. The `reset_index` function is used to convert the Series back to a DataFrame. Then, the `rename` function is used to rename the "p" column to "mean". The function finally returns the modified DataFrame.

Here is how you can use this function:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# Assume datafile is a file containing your data
datain = np.loadtxt(datafile)
df = pd.DataFrame(data = datain, columns = ["t","p","x","y","z"])

df = renameDataFrame(df)
```

After running this code, `df` will be a DataFrame with the "t" column and a "mean" column, which contains the mean of the "p" values for each group of "t".
