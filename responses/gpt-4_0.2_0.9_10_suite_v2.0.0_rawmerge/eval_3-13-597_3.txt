In Kotlin, you can use the `ArrayList` constructor with an initial capacity if you know the eventual number of elements in advance. This is a perfectly valid `MutableList` and can help optimize performance by avoiding unnecessary resizing operations. Here's how you can do it:

```kotlin
val list = ArrayList<Int>(initialCapacity)
```

So, your first option is the recommended approach in this case. It's idiomatic Kotlin and aligns with the principle of using the right tool for the job.
