The `apt-get` package manager installs the version of the software that is available in the repositories of your Linux distribution. If the latest version of `cmake` is not available in your distribution's repositories, `apt-get` will not be able to install it.

Here is a step-by-step guide on how to install the latest version of `cmake` from source:

1. First, you need to uninstall the existing `cmake`:

```bash
sudo apt-get remove cmake
```

2. Download the latest version of `cmake` from the official website. At the time of writing, the latest version is 3.21.1. Replace `3.21.1` with the latest version if it has changed.

```bash
wget https://github.com/Kitware/CMake/releases/download/v3.21.1/cmake-3.21.1.tar.gz
```

3. Extract the downloaded file:

```bash
tar -xzvf cmake-3.21.1.tar.gz
```

4. Navigate to the extracted directory:

```bash
cd cmake-3.21.1
```

5. Now, run the bootstrap script:

```bash
./bootstrap
```

6. Once the bootstrap script is done, compile the source code:

```bash
make
```

7. After the compilation is done, install `cmake`:

```bash
sudo make install
```

8. Verify the installed version of `cmake`:

```bash
cmake --version
```

This should output `cmake version 3.21.1` or whichever version you installed.
