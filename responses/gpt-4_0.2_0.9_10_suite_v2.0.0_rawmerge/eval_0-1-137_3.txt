The error you're getting is because you're trying to import the `variables.scss` file from Bootstrap before you declare your own `$theme-colors` map. The `variables.scss` file already contains a `$theme-colors` map, and when you import it, it gets processed before your own map, causing the error.

To fix this, you should declare your `$theme-colors` map before importing the Bootstrap files. Here's how you can do it:

```scss
$theme-colors: (
  "primary": #your-color, // replace #your-color with your desired color
  "secondary": #6c757d,
  "success": #28a745,
  "info": #17a2b8,
  "warning": #ffc107,
  "danger": #dc3545,
  "light": #f8f9fa,
  "dark": #343a40
);

@import "../../node_modules/bootstrap/scss/bootstrap";
```

In the above code, replace `#your-color` with the color you want to use for the primary theme color. You can also change the other colors if you want.

This will override the default Bootstrap theme colors with your own. When you compile your SCSS, it should now work without any errors.
