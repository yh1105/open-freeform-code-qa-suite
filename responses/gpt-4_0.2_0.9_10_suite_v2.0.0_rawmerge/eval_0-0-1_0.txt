It's hard to provide a specific solution without seeing your code, but here are some general steps you can follow to debug and potentially solve your issue:

1. **Check your build command**: Make sure your build command is correct in your Vercel settings. It should be `yarn run build` or `npm run build` depending on what you use.

2. **Check your output directory**: By default, Next.js uses `.next` as the output directory. If you've changed this, you need to update the "Output Directory" in your Vercel settings to match.

3. **Check your dynamic routes**: If you're using dynamic routes, make sure you're using `getStaticPaths` and `getStaticProps` correctly. If you're using `getServerSideProps`, it might cause issues because Vercel uses a serverless platform, and `getServerSideProps` is not fully compatible with serverless.

4. **Check your public folder**: If you have a `public` folder, make sure it's named correctly and that the files inside it are being referenced correctly in your code.

5. **Check your dependencies**: Make sure all your dependencies are included in your `package.json` file. If you've installed something locally and didn't save it to your `package.json`, it won't be installed when Vercel builds your project.

6. **Check your environment variables**: If you're using environment variables, make sure they're set up correctly in Vercel. You can add them in the "Environment Variables" section of your project settings.

7. **Check the build logs**: The build logs in Vercel can give you more information about what's going wrong. If there's an error during the build process, it should show up there.

8. **Create a `next.config.js` file**: Although you mentioned you don't have a `next.config.js` file, it might be helpful to create one. You can use it to customize your build process, which might help solve your issue.

If none of these steps solve your issue, it might be a good idea to reach out to Vercel support or ask for help on a platform like StackOverflow. Be sure to include as much information as possible about your issue, including any error messages you're seeing and what you've tried so far.
