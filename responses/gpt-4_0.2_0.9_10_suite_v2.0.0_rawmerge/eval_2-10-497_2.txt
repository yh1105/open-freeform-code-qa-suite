In Rust, `Box<T>` is a smart pointer that points to data on the heap. It cannot be null. If you want to have a nullable pointer, you should use `Option<Box<T>>` instead. When the `Option` is `None`, it represents a null pointer. When it is `Some(box)`, it contains a valid `Box`.

Here is how you can modify your code:

```rust
struct Node {
    value: i32,
    next: Option<Box<Node>>,
}

struct Stack {
    top: Option<Box<Node>>,
}
```

To check if the `Box` is null, you can use the `is_none()` method:

```rust
if stack.top.is_none() {
    println!("The stack is empty");
} else {
    println!("The stack is not empty");
}
```

To add a new node to the stack, you can use the `Some` variant:

```rust
stack.top = Some(Box::new(Node { value: 5, next: None }));
```

To remove a node from the stack, you can use the `take()` method, which replaces the `Option` with `None` and returns the original value:

```rust
let node = stack.top.take();
```

This will set `stack.top` to `None` and `node` to `Some(box)`, where `box` is the original `Box<Node>`. If `stack.top` was already `None`, `node` will also be `None`.
