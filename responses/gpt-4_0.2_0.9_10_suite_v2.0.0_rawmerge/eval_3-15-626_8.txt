The code you provided seems to be on the right track, but there are a few issues. 

First, you're trying to use `query` and `currentSheet` as variables, but you haven't declared them as such. You need to declare them using the `Dim` statement.

Second, you're trying to use `query` as a `WorkbookQuery` object, but you're assigning it a string value. 

Third, you're trying to use `query.Name` as part of your connection string, but `query` is a string, not a `WorkbookQuery` object, so it doesn't have a `Name` property.

Here's a corrected version of your code:

```vba
Sub LoadToWorksheetOnly()

    Dim query As String
    Dim currentSheet As String

    ' Get the query from the cell A1 in Sheet6
    query = Sheets("Sheet6").Range("A1").Value

    ' Get the name of the active sheet
    currentSheet = ActiveSheet.Name

    ' Add a new ListObject with a QueryTable that uses the Power Query connection string
    With ActiveSheet.ListObjects.Add(SourceType:=0, Source:= _
        "OLEDB;Provider=Microsoft.Mashup.OleDb.1;Data Source=$Workbook$;Location=" & query _
        , Destination:=Sheets("target").Range("$A$1")).QueryTable
        .CommandType = xlCmdDefault
        .CommandText = Array("SELECT * FROM [" & query & "]")
        .RowNumbers = False
        .FillAdjacentFormulas = False
        .PreserveFormatting = True
        .RefreshOnFileOpen = False
        .BackgroundQuery = True
        .RefreshStyle = xlInsertDeleteCells
        .SavePassword = False
        .SaveData = True
        .AdjustColumnWidth = True
        .RefreshPeriod = 0
        .PreserveColumnInfo = False
        .Refresh BackgroundQuery:=False
    End With

End Sub
```

This code assumes that the value in cell A1 of Sheet6 is the name of a Power Query query in the workbook. If that's not the case, you'll need to adjust the code accordingly.
