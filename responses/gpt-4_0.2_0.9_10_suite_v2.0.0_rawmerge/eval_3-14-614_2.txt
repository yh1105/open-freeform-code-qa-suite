There could be several reasons why the SwiftUI preview is not showing in Xcode 11. Here are some things you can try:

1. **Check your macOS and Xcode version**: SwiftUI requires macOS Catalina and Xcode 11. Make sure you have the correct versions installed.

2. **Check your device and iOS version**: SwiftUI requires iOS 13.0 or later. Make sure your device and iOS version meet this requirement.

3. **Try to clean and rebuild your project**: Sometimes, cleaning the project (Shift + Command + K) and rebuilding it (Command + B) can solve the problem.

4. **Restart Xcode**: Sometimes, Xcode can have some glitches. Restarting Xcode can often solve these issues.

5. **Check your code for errors**: Make sure there are no errors in your code that could be preventing the preview from showing.

6. **Try to manually show the canvas**: You can manually show the canvas by going to the menu `View -> Editor -> Canvas`.

7. **Check your SwiftUI code**: Make sure your SwiftUI code is correct. The code you posted seems fine, but there might be issues elsewhere in your code.

If none of these solutions work, you might want to consider reinstalling Xcode or updating to a newer version.
