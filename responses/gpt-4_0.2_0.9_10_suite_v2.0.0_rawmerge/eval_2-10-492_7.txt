Sure, you can fill in the blanks with the following:

```
    let ix = anchor_lang::solana_program::system_instruction::transfer(
        &user_account.key(),
        &event_vault_address,
        amount,
    );
    anchor_lang::solana_program::program::invoke(
        &ix,
        &[
            user_account.clone(),
            ctx.accounts.system_program.clone(),
        ],
    );
```

In this example, `user_account` is the account of the user who is depositing SOL, `event_vault_address` is the address of the event account's vault where the SOL is being deposited, and `amount` is the amount of SOL being transferred. The `system_program` account is needed for the `invoke` function to have the necessary permissions to perform the transfer.
