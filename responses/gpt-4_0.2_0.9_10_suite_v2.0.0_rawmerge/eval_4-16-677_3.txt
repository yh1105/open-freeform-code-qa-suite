The issue is that you're using single quotes around your variable `$searchT` in the `grep` command. In bash, single quotes preserve the literal value of all characters within the quotes, meaning that your variable isn't being expanded to its value. You should use double quotes instead.

Here's the corrected version of your script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
read -p "enter search term here: " searchT

if [[ $(cat test.txt | grep -wi "$searchT") ]]; then     
    echo "$(cat test.txt | grep "$searchT" | wc -l) number of matches found"
    echo $(cat test.txt | grep "$searchT")

else 
    echo "no match found"    

fi

exit 0
```

In this corrected version, `$searchT` is enclosed in double quotes, allowing the variable to be expanded to its value. Now, the `grep` command can correctly search for the term entered by the user.
