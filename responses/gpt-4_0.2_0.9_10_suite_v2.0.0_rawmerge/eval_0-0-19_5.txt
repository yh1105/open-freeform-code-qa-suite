The error message indicates that the package `aws-sdk-js` cannot be found in the npm registry. This is likely because the package does not exist or the name is incorrect.

The official AWS SDK for JavaScript in Node.js is named `aws-sdk`, not `aws-sdk-js`. 

Try installing the package using the correct name:

```bash
npm install aws-sdk
```

This should resolve the issue.
