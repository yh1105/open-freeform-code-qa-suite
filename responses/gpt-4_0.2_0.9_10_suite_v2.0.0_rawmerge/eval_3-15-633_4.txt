Yes, you can achieve similar results using an array formula with `INDEX` and `SMALL` functions in Excel versions that do not support the `FILTER` function. Here's how you can do it:

Assuming your data starts from row 2, you can use the following formula:

```excel
=IFERROR(INDEX($B$2:$B$100, SMALL(IF($A$2:$A$100="x", ROW($A$2:$A$100)-ROW($A$2)+1), ROW(1:1))), "")
```

This is an array formula, so you need to enter it with Ctrl+Shift+Enter, not just Enter. After entering the formula, drag it down until you start getting blanks to get all the values.

This formula works by creating an array of row numbers where column A is "x", then uses the `SMALL` function with `ROW(1:1)` to get the nth smallest value from that array, where n is the row number of the current cell. The `INDEX` function then returns the value from column B at that row number.

Remember to adjust the ranges `$B$2:$B$100` and `$A$2:$A$100` to match your actual data.
