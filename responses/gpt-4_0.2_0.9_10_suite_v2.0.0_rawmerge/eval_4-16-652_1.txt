The AWS CLI uses a pager program to handle its output. By default, it uses the `less` program. The pager is used to manage the output when it's too large to fit on your screen. However, in your case, it's causing an issue because it's pausing your script.

To disable the pager, you can set the `AWS_PAGER` environment variable to an empty string. You can do this in your script before calling the AWS CLI commands:

```bash
export AWS_PAGER=""
for x in 1 2 3; do 
  aws sqs purge-queue --queue-url https://sqs.<aws-region>.amazonaws.com/<id>/<env>-$x-<queueName>.fifo; 
done
```

This will disable the pager for the duration of your script. If you want to disable the pager permanently, you can add the `export AWS_PAGER=""` line to your shell's profile file (like `~/.bashrc` or `~/.bash_profile` for bash, `~/.zshrc` for zsh).

Alternatively, if you want to redirect the output to a file, you can use the redirection operator (`>`) in bash:

```bash
for x in 1 2 3; do 
  aws sqs purge-queue --queue-url https://sqs.<aws-region>.amazonaws.com/<id>/<env>-$x-<queueName>.fifo > output.txt; 
done
```

This will write the output of each command to the `output.txt` file. If you want to append the output to the file instead of overwriting it each time, you can use the append operator (`>>`):

```bash
for x in 1 2 3; do 
  aws sqs purge-queue --queue-url https://sqs.<aws-region>.amazonaws.com/<id>/<env>-$x-<queueName>.fifo >> output.txt; 
done
```
