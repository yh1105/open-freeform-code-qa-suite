To create a calendar input in VBA Excel, you can use the `Application.InputBox` method with `Type:=8` to get a date input. Here is a simple example:

```vba
Sub GetDate()
    Dim dateInput As Date
    dateInput = Application.InputBox("Enter a date", "Date Input", Type:=8)
    MsgBox "You entered: " & dateInput
End Sub
```

In this code, `Application.InputBox` with `Type:=8` will show a dialog box with a date picker. The selected date will be stored in the `dateInput` variable.

Please note that this method might not work in all versions of Excel. If it doesn't work in your version, you might need to create a UserForm with a DatePicker control. However, this requires that the Microsoft DatePicker control is installed and registered on the user's computer.
