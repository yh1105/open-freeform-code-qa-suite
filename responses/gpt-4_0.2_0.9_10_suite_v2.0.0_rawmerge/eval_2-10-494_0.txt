The error message "could not resolve macro `$crate::format_args`" is coming from rust-analyzer, which is a language server protocol implementation for Rust. It's not an error from the Rust compiler itself.

This error is likely a false positive, which means that it's an error that isn't really an error. Rust-analyzer sometimes has issues with macro resolution, especially in more complex scenarios. The `$crate::format_args` is a macro used internally by Rust for formatting strings, and it seems like rust-analyzer is having trouble resolving it in your code.

If your code is compiling and running correctly, and the tests are passing, then you can safely ignore this error. It's just a limitation of rust-analyzer, not a problem with your code.

You can try to update your rust-analyzer to the latest version, as the developers are constantly making improvements and fixing bugs. If the problem persists, you can report it as a bug to the rust-analyzer team.

In the meantime, if the error message is bothering you, you can disable macro error diagnostics in rust-analyzer settings. In VS Code, you can do this by opening settings (File > Preferences > Settings), search for "rust-analyzer.diagnostics.enableExperimental", and uncheck the box.
