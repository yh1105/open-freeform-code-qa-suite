To create a calendar input in VBA Excel, you can use a UserForm with a ComboBox for day, month, and year. Here's a simple example:

1. First, create a new UserForm in VBA (Insert > UserForm).
2. Add three ComboBoxes to the UserForm. You can name them `cmbDay`, `cmbMonth`, and `cmbYear`.
3. In the UserForm's code module, add the following code to populate the ComboBoxes:

```vba
Private Sub UserForm_Initialize()

    Dim i As Integer

    ' Populate the day combo box
    For i = 1 To 31
        cmbDay.AddItem i
    Next i

    ' Populate the month combo box
    For i = 1 To 12
        cmbMonth.AddItem MonthName(i)
    Next i

    ' Populate the year combo box
    For i = Year(Date) - 10 To Year(Date) + 10
        cmbYear.AddItem i
    Next i

End Sub
```

4. You can then use the `UserForm.Show` method to display the form and allow the user to select a date.

Please note that this is a very basic example and doesn't account for different numbers of days in different months or leap years. You might want to add additional code to handle these cases.
