The `sourceMap` option in the `tsconfig.json` file is used for debugging purposes. 

When `"sourceMap": true`, it generates corresponding `.map` files for each `.js` file. These `.map` files are source map files that map the JavaScript code back to the original TypeScript code. This is extremely useful when you are debugging your application in a browser, as the browser debugger will show the original TypeScript code, which is much easier to understand and debug than the generated JavaScript code.

When you set `"sourceMap": false`, it means that these `.map` files won't be generated. So, if you debug your application in a browser, you will see the generated JavaScript code instead of the original TypeScript code. 

You might not see any immediate change in your app's behavior because source maps don't affect the runtime behavior of your application. They are purely a development and debugging aid. 

In terms of performance, turning off source maps can speed up your build process slightly, because generating source maps does take some time. However, this is usually a minor concern compared to the benefits of easier debugging.
