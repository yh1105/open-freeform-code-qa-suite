You can use `jq` to minify JSON in a shell script. `jq` is a lightweight and flexible command-line JSON processor. If it's not already installed, you can install it with the package manager for your system. For example, on Ubuntu you would use:

```bash
sudo apt-get install jq
```

Once you have `jq` installed, you can use it to minify JSON like this:

```bash
echo '{
    "foo": "lorem",
    "bar": "ipsum"
}' | jq -c .
```

The `-c` option stands for "compact output". It will remove all unnecessary whitespace, giving you the minified JSON you're looking for.

This will output:

```bash
{"foo":"lorem","bar":"ipsum"}
```

You can also use `jq` to minify JSON from a file. For example, if your JSON is in a file named `input.json`, you can minify it like this:

```bash
jq -c . input.json > output.json
```

This will read the JSON from `input.json`, minify it, and write the result to `output.json`.
