You need to add the `go_package` option in your proto file. This option specifies the package name for the generated Go code. Here's how you can modify your proto file:

```go
syntax="proto3";

package main;

option go_package = "main";

message Person {
      string name = 1;
      int32 age = 2;
}
```

In this case, the `go_package` is set to "main". You should replace "main" with the actual package name you want to use for your generated Go code.

After modifying your proto file, you can generate the Go code with the same command:

```bash
protoc --go_out=. simple.proto
```

This should generate the Go code without any errors.
