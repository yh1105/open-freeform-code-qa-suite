In Rust, the caret operator (`^`) is not used for exponentiation. It is actually a bitwise XOR operator.

To perform exponentiation in Rust, you can use the `pow` method that is available for integers. Here's an example:

```rust
fn main() {
    let base = 2;
    let exponent = 3;
    let result = base.pow(exponent);
    println!("2 to the power of 3 is {}", result);
}
```

In this example, `base.pow(exponent)` raises `base` to the power of `exponent`.

Please note that the `pow` method takes an unsigned 32-bit integer (`u32`) as an argument. If you have a larger exponent, you may need to use a loop or recursion to calculate the result.
