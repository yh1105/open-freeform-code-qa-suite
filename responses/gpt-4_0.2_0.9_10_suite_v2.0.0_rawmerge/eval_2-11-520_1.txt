The error message you're seeing is because the `operator==` in your `SeviceClient` class is trying to override a function that doesn't exist in the base class. In your `IClient` class, the `operator==` is declared to take a reference to an `IClient` object, but in your `SeviceClient` class, you're trying to override it with a function that takes a reference to a `SeviceClient` object.

To fix this, you need to make sure that the `operator==` in your `SeviceClient` class takes a reference to an `IClient` object, just like in the base class. Here's how you can do that:

```c++
bool operator==(const IClient<int8_t>& anotherClient) override {
    const SeviceClient& anotherServiceClient = static_cast<const SeviceClient&>(anotherClient);
    // Now you can compare this object with anotherServiceClient
    return true;
}
```

In this code, we're first casting the `IClient` reference to a `SeviceClient` reference, and then you can compare `this` object with `anotherServiceClient`.

Please note that this approach assumes that the `anotherClient` object is actually of type `SeviceClient`. If it's not, the `static_cast` will lead to undefined behavior. If you're not sure about the type of `anotherClient`, you should use `dynamic_cast` instead and check if the result is not null before using it.
