The warning message is indicating that your Elasticsearch cluster does not have security features enabled. This means that anyone can access your cluster without authentication. 

To fix this, you need to enable the built-in security features of Elasticsearch. Here are the steps to do this:

1. Open your `elasticsearch.yml` configuration file. This file is usually located in the `config` directory of your Elasticsearch installation.

2. Add the following lines to the file:

    ```yml
    xpack.security.enabled: true
    xpack.security.transport.ssl.enabled: true
    ```

3. Save and close the file.

4. Restart Elasticsearch.

Please note that enabling security will require all users to authenticate. You will need to create user credentials if you haven't done so already. 

Also, keep in mind that enabling security might have implications for your application. For example, you will need to update your application to include authentication when connecting to Elasticsearch.

If you're using Searchkick, you can specify the username and password in the `url` option when initializing Searchkick:

```ruby
Searchkick.client = Elasticsearch::Client.new(
  urls: ["http://username:password@localhost:9200"]
)
```

Replace `username` and `password` with your actual Elasticsearch credentials.

Remember to replace these hardcoded credentials with environment variables in a production environment to keep your Elasticsearch server secure.
