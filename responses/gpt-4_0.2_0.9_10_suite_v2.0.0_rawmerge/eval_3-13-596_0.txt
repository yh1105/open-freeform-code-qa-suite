The `myprogram-0.0.1-plain.jar` is generated by the `bootJar` task in Spring Boot 2.5.0. If you want to disable the generation of the `*-plain.jar` file, you can configure the `bootJar` task in your `build.gradle` file to not include the `classifier`:

```groovy
bootJar {
    classifier = ''
}
```

This will result in only the `myprogram-0.0.1.jar` file being generated.
