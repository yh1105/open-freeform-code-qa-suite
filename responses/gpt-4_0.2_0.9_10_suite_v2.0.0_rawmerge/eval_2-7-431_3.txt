In Laravel, the `dd()` function is a helper function that stands for "dump and die". It's used to dump a variable's contents to the browser and stop further script execution. However, it doesn't have any built-in limitations. If you're having trouble viewing all of your data, it's likely due to limitations with your browser or the amount of data you're trying to dump at once.

Here are a few alternatives you could try:

1. **Use the `dump()` function instead of `dd()`.** The `dump()` function works similarly to `dd()`, but it doesn't stop the script execution. This means you can use multiple `dump()` calls to output different parts of your data.

    ```php
    dump($data->relation1);
    dump($data->relation2);
    // ...
    ```

2. **Log the data instead of dumping it to the browser.** Laravel provides a simple logging system that you can use to write your data to a file. This can be helpful if you're dealing with a large amount of data.

    ```php
    \Log::info(print_r($data, true));
    ```

3. **Use a package like Laravel Debugbar or Laravel Telescope.** These packages provide a more sophisticated debugging interface that can handle larger amounts of data.

4. **Increase the memory limit in your `php.ini` file.** If you're running out of memory when trying to dump your data, you might need to increase the `memory_limit` setting in your `php.ini` file. However, be careful with this option, as it can lead to other problems if you're not careful.

Remember, if you're dealing with a large amount of data, it's often better to process it in smaller chunks rather than trying to dump it all at once.
