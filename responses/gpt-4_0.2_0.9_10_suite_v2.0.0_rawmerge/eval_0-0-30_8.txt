Yes, there is an unofficial adapter for React 17 that you can use. It's called `@wojtekmaj/enzyme-adapter-react-17`. You can install it via npm:

```bash
npm install --save @wojtekmaj/enzyme-adapter-react-17
```

Then you can adapt your import code as follows:

```javascript
import Enzyme from 'enzyme';
import Adapter from '@wojtekmaj/enzyme-adapter-react-17';

Enzyme.configure({ adapter: new Adapter() });
```

This should allow you to use Enzyme with React 17.0.1. Please note that this is an unofficial adapter, so it may not support all features or have the same level of support as the official adapters.
