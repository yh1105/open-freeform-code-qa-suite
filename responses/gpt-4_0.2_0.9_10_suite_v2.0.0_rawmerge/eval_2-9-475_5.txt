It seems like you're missing the `libffi` library, which is a dependency for the `travis-cli` gem. You can install it using Homebrew. If you don't have Homebrew installed, you can install it first using the following command:

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

Then, you can install `libffi` using the following command:

```bash
brew install libffi
```

After installing `libffi`, you might need to specify the path to `libffi`'s pkgconfig file. You can do this by adding the following line to your shell profile file (`.bash_profile`, `.bashrc`, or `.zshrc` depending on your shell):

```bash
export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/usr/local/opt/libffi/lib/pkgconfig"
```

Then, source your profile file. For example, if you added the line to `.bash_profile`, you would use:

```bash
source ~/.bash_profile
```

Now, you should be able to install the `travis-cli` gem without any issues:

```bash
gem install travis
```
