This issue can be caused by a variety of reasons. Here are a few solutions that you can try:

1. **Clean the project**: You can do this by going to `Product -> Clean Build Folder` or by pressing `Shift + Command + K`.

2. **Delete derived data**: You can do this by going to `Window -> Organizer -> Projects -> Delete Derived Data`.

3. **Update CocoaPods**: If you're using CocoaPods, try updating it to the latest version. You can do this by running `sudo gem install cocoapods` in the terminal.

4. **Check Swift version**: Make sure that the Swift version in your `Podfile` matches the Swift version of your project. You can specify the Swift version in your `Podfile` like this:

    ```ruby
    post_install do |installer|
      installer.pods_project.targets.each do |target|
        target.build_configurations.each do |config|
          config.build_settings['SWIFT_VERSION'] = '5.0' # specify your Swift version here
        end
      end
    end
    ```

5. **Check your code**: The error might be caused by some problematic code in your project. Check the error message for more details about where the error might be.

6. **Reinstall Xcode**: If none of the above solutions work, you might want to try reinstalling Xcode.

Remember to always backup your project before making any changes.
