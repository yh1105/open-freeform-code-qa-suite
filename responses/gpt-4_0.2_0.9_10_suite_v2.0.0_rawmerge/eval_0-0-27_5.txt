Your code seems correct and should work as expected. However, there are a few things you might want to check:

1. **Network Connection**: Ensure that your device/emulator has a proper network connection. Sometimes, the loading state might hang due to network issues.

2. **Server Status**: Check if the server at 'https://48p1r2roz4.sse.codesandbox.io' is up and running. You can do this by visiting the URL in your web browser.

3. **GraphQL Query**: Make sure that your GraphQL query is correct. You can test your query using a GraphQL client like GraphQL Playground or Apollo Studio.

4. **Apollo Client Version**: There might be compatibility issues with the version of Apollo Client you're using. Try downgrading to an older version to see if that resolves the issue.

5. **React Native Debugger**: If you're using React Native Debugger, make sure to enable network inspect. This will allow you to see the network requests and responses, which can help you debug the issue.

6. **Error Handling**: You might want to log the error to get more details about what's going wrong. You can do this by adding `console.log(error)` in your error handling code.

If none of these suggestions work, please provide more details about the issue, such as any error messages you're seeing and the results of your debugging efforts.
