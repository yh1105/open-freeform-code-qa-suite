The `navigator.geolocation` object is available in the user's browser, but it doesn't necessarily mean that the user has given permission to access their location. The `getCurrentPosition` method is asynchronous and takes two callbacks as parameters: the first one is called when the location is successfully retrieved, and the second one is called when an error occurs (like when the user denies the location permission).

Here is how you can modify your code:

```javascript
if (navigator.geolocation) {
    navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(
        position => {
            console.log("Location accessed");
        },
        error => {
            console.log("User not allowed");
        }
    );
} else {
    console.log("Geolocation is not supported by this browser.");
}
```

In this code, if the user allows access to their location, "Location accessed" will be logged to the console. If the user denies access or if an error occurs, "User not allowed" will be logged. If the `navigator.geolocation` object is not available (which means that the browser does not support the Geolocation API), "Geolocation is not supported by this browser." will be logged.
