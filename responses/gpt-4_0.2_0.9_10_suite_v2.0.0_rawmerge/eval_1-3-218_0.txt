You can use the `str.replace()` function in pandas to replace the special characters with an empty string. Here is the function you requested:

```python
def remove(df):
    df['LGA'] = df['LGA'].str.replace(r"\(.*\)", "")
    df['LGA'] = df['LGA'].str.strip()  # to remove any leading or trailing white spaces
    return df
```

This function uses a regular expression (regex) to match any characters between parentheses and replace them with an empty string. The `str.strip()` function is used to remove any leading or trailing white spaces that may be left after the replacement.

Please note that this function modifies the original DataFrame. If you want to keep the original DataFrame unchanged, you should create a copy before applying the function.

Also, this function assumes that the DataFrame has a column named 'LGA'. If the column name is different, you should replace 'LGA' with the actual column name.
