This error typically occurs because the script `startup.sh` does not have execute permissions. You can add execute permissions to the script by running the following command:

```bash
chmod +x ./startup.sh
```

This command changes the mode of the script to executable. After running this command, you should be able to execute your script with `./startup.sh nginx:start`.
