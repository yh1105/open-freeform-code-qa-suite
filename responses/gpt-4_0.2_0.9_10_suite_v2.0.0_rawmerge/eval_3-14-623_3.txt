This issue can be caused by a variety of reasons, but here are a few common solutions that you can try:

1. **Clean the project and derived data:** 

   You can clean the project by going to `Product > Clean Build Folder` or by pressing `Shift + Command + K`. To clean derived data, go to `Window > Organizer > Select your project > Delete Derived Data`.

2. **Update your CocoaPods:**

   You can update your CocoaPods by running the following commands in the terminal:

   ```bash
   sudo gem install cocoapods
   pod update
   ```

3. **Disable parallel builds:**

   Go to `File > Workspace Settings` (or `File > Project Settings` if you're not using a workspace). Then, set `Build System` to `Legacy Build System`.

4. **Check your Swift version:**

   Make sure that your Swift version is compatible with the version required by your Pods. You can check this in the `Podfile`.

5. **Check for any syntax errors:**

   Sometimes, the error can be caused by a simple syntax error in your Swift files. Make sure to check all your files for any potential errors.

If none of these solutions work, it would be helpful if you could provide more information about the specific errors that you're encountering.
