Yes, in Flutter, you can draw vertical lines between components by using the `VerticalDivider` widget. 

Here is a simple example:

```dart
Row(
  children: <Widget>[
    Expanded(
      child: Text('Component 1'),
    ),
    const VerticalDivider(
      color: Colors.grey,
      thickness: 1,
    ),
    Expanded(
      child: Text('Component 2'),
    ),
  ],
)
```

In this example, a vertical line (divider) is drawn between two text components. The `VerticalDivider` widget allows you to customize the color and thickness of the line. 

Please note that the `VerticalDivider` widget is only visible when used in a `Row` widget. If you want to use it in a `Column` widget, you can use the `Divider` widget instead.
