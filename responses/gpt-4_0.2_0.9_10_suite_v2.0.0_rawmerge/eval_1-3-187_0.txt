You can achieve this by first creating a dictionary that maps the elements in `b` to the elements in `rest`. Then, you can iterate over the `last` list and replace the elements using this dictionary. Here is the function `ReplaceElementsByIndex`:

```python
def ReplaceElementsByIndex(rest, b, last):
    # Create a dictionary that maps the first 4 elements in b to the elements in rest
    replace_dict = {b[i]: rest[i] for i in range(4)}
    
    # Replace the elements in last according to the replace_dict
    last = [replace_dict.get(x, x) for x in last]
    
    return last
```

You can use this function like this:

```python
rest=[5, 7, 11, 4]
b=[21, 22, 33, 31, 23, 15, 19, 13, 6]
last=[33, 19, 40, 21, 31, 22, 6, 15, 13, 23]

print(ReplaceElementsByIndex(rest, b, last))
```

This will output:

```python
[11, 19, 40, 5, 4, 7, 6, 15, 13, 23]
```

This function works by first creating a dictionary `replace_dict` that maps the first 4 elements in `b` to the elements in `rest`. Then, it creates a new list by iterating over the `last` list and replacing each element `x` with `replace_dict[x]` if `x` is in `replace_dict`, or with `x` itself otherwise. This is done using the `get` method of the dictionary, which returns the value for a key if it exists in the dictionary, or a default value otherwise.
