The warning you're seeing is because Elasticsearch 7.13.1 has built-in security features that are not enabled by default. This means that without authentication, your Elasticsearch cluster could be accessible to anyone.

Here are the steps to enable Elasticsearch's built-in security features:

1. **Set up passwords for built-in users**

    You can use the `elasticsearch-setup-passwords` command to set up passwords for the built-in users, including the `elastic` and `kibana` users.

    ```bash
    bin/elasticsearch-setup-passwords interactive
    ```

    This command will prompt you for passwords for the `elastic`, `apm_system`, `kibana`, `logstash_system`, `beats_system`, and `remote_monitoring_user` users.

2. **Enable security in Elasticsearch**

    To enable security in Elasticsearch, you need to configure SSL/TLS for both HTTP and transport networking, and you need to enable the Elasticsearch security features.

    Open the `elasticsearch.yml` configuration file and make the following changes:

    ```yaml
    xpack.security.enabled: true
    xpack.security.transport.ssl.enabled: true
    xpack.security.transport.ssl.verification_mode: certificate 
    xpack.security.transport.ssl.keystore.path: elastic-certificates.p12 
    xpack.security.transport.ssl.truststore.path: elastic-certificates.p12 

    xpack.security.http.ssl.enabled: true
    xpack.security.http.ssl.keystore.path: "http.p12"
    ```

    The `elastic-certificates.p12` and `http.p12` files are the certificates that you need to generate. You can use the Elasticsearch's built-in tool to generate these certificates:

    ```bash
    bin/elasticsearch-certutil ca
    bin/elasticsearch-certutil cert --ca elastic-stack-ca.p12
    ```

    This will generate a zip file that includes the `.p12` files. You need to extract this zip file and move the `.p12` files to the Elasticsearch configuration directory.

3. **Restart Elasticsearch**

    After making these changes, you need to restart Elasticsearch for the changes to take effect.

Please note that enabling security will require all users to authenticate. This includes Kibana, Logstash, Beats, and any other user that connects to Elasticsearch.
