The error message you're seeing is because Bootstrap 4 requires `popper.js` for popover and tooltip components. If you're not using these components, you can import Bootstrap without `popper.js`. But if you're using them, you need to install `popper.js`.

Here are the steps to fix this issue:

1. Install `popper.js` via npm:

```bash
npm install popper.js --save
```

2. After installing `popper.js`, you need to import it in your file before importing Bootstrap:

```javascript
import Popper from 'popper.js';
import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css';
import 'bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.min.js';
```

3. If you're using Webpack, you can add the following to your Webpack configuration file:

```javascript
plugins: [
  new webpack.ProvidePlugin({
    $: 'jquery',
    jQuery: 'jquery',
    'window.jQuery': 'jquery',
    Popper: ['popper.js', 'default'],
  }),
]
```

This will make `Popper` available to all your modules without having to import it explicitly.

Remember to restart your development server after making these changes.
