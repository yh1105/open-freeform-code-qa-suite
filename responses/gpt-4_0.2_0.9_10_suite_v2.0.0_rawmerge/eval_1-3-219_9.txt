There could be several reasons why you're unable to start a Jupyter notebook on VS Code. Here are a few troubleshooting steps you can take:

1. **Check your Python interpreter**: Make sure that the Python interpreter you're using in VS Code is the one from your conda environment. You can select the interpreter by clicking on the Python version in the bottom-left corner of the VS Code window.

2. **Check your Jupyter server**: Try starting a Jupyter server manually from the command line in your conda environment. You can do this by activating your conda environment and running `jupyter notebook`. If this works, then the issue is likely with VS Code.

3. **Check your Python and IPyKernel versions**: Make sure that your Python and IPyKernel versions are compatible. You can check your Python version by running `python --version` in your conda environment, and you can check your IPyKernel version by running `pip show ipykernel`.

4. **Reinstall IPyKernel**: Try reinstalling IPyKernel in your conda environment. You can do this by running `pip uninstall ipykernel` followed by `pip install ipykernel`.

5. **Check your VS Code settings**: Make sure that your VS Code settings are correctly configured for Jupyter. You can check this by going to File > Preferences > Settings and searching for "Jupyter". Make sure that the "Jupyter: Enable Native Interactive Window" and "Jupyter: Enable Notebook Editor" settings are enabled.

6. **Check your VS Code extensions**: Make sure that you have the latest versions of the Python and Jupyter extensions for VS Code. You can check this by going to the Extensions view in VS Code (you can open this by clicking on the Extensions icon in the Activity Bar on the side of the VS Code window).

If none of these steps solve your problem, please provide more information about your setup (e.g., the exact versions of Python, IPyKernel, and VS Code that you're using) so that we can help you further.
