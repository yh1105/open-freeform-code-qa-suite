The error you're getting is because you're trying to import the Bootstrap variables file before you declare your own `$theme-colors` map. This causes a conflict because the Bootstrap variables file also declares a `$theme-colors` map.

To fix this, you should declare your `$theme-colors` map before importing the Bootstrap SCSS files. Here's how you can do it:

```scss
// Define your own theme colors
$theme-colors: (
  "primary": #your-color-here,
  "secondary": #6c757d,
  "success": #198754,
  "info": #0dcaf0,
  "warning": #ffc107,
  "danger": #dc3545,
  "light": #f8f9fa,
  "dark": #212529
);

// Then import Bootstrap
@import "../../node_modules/bootstrap/scss/bootstrap";
```

In the above code, replace `#your-color-here` with the color you want to use for the primary theme color. You can also change the other theme colors if you want.

This should solve your problem. When you compile your SCSS file now, it should generate a valid CSS file with your custom theme colors.
