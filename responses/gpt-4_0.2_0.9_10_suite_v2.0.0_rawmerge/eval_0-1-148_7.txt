Sure, you can use the `last:` variant provided by Tailwind CSS to target the last element in your list. Here's how you can modify your code:

```html
  <ul>
    <li
      v-for="(item, index) in items"
      :key="`item-${index}`"
      :class="{ 'border-b border-black border-solid': index !== items.length - 1 }"
    >
      Item
    </li>
  </ul>
```

In this code, the `border-b border-black border-solid` classes are only applied if the current index is not equal to the last index of the items array. This will effectively add a bottom border to all `<li>` elements except the last one.
