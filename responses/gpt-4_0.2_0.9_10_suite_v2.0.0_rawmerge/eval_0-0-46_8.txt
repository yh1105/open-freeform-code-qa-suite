The error message you're seeing is because ESLint is trying to read your `tsconfig.json` file but it can't find it. This is because the `project` property in the `parserOptions` object in your `.eslintrc.js` file is set to `"tsconfig.json"`, which means ESLint is looking for the `tsconfig.json` file in the same directory as your `.eslintrc.js` file.

If your `tsconfig.json` file is not in the same directory as your `.eslintrc.js` file, you'll need to provide the correct relative path to your `tsconfig.json` file.

For example, if your `tsconfig.json` file is in the root directory of your project and your `.eslintrc.js` file is in a subdirectory, you would change the `project` property to `"../tsconfig.json"`.

If your `tsconfig.json` file is in a subdirectory called `config`, you would change the `project` property to `"./config/tsconfig.json"`.

Here's how you can modify your `.eslintrc.js` file:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  // ...
  parserOptions: {
    project: "./path/to/your/tsconfig.json", // replace with your tsconfig.json path
    sourceType: "module",
  },
  // ...
};
```

Replace `./path/to/your/tsconfig.json` with the actual relative path to your `tsconfig.json` file.

After making this change, you should restart VSCode or run the "Reload Window" command to make sure your changes are picked up. If the error persists, there might be other issues with your ESLint or TypeScript configuration.
