The Docker build output on OSX is different from Linux due to the way Docker works on OSX. Docker on OSX runs in a virtual machine, and the Docker client communicates with the Docker daemon running inside this VM. This can cause some differences in the output.

If you want to see the full output of a command in a Dockerfile, you can use the `RUN` command in combination with a shell command that writes its output to a file, and then use the `RUN cat` command to display the contents of this file.

Here is an example:

```Dockerfile
FROM debian:stretch-slim

RUN apt-get update && apt-get upgrade -y
RUN apt-get install wget -y
RUN wget https://dev.mysql.com/get/Downloads/MySQL-5.7/mysql-5.7.22-linux-glibc2.12-x86_64.tar.gz
RUN tar -zxvf mysql-5.7.22-linux-glibc2.12-x86_64.tar.gz
RUN mv mysql-5.7.22-linux-glibc2.12-x86_64 mysql-5.7.22
RUN ls -la > output.txt
RUN cat output.txt
```

In this Dockerfile, the `ls -la` command writes its output to a file called `output.txt`, and then the `cat output.txt` command displays the contents of this file. This way, you can see the full output of the `ls -la` command.

However, please note that this is a workaround and it might not be suitable for all situations. If you frequently need to see the full output of commands in Dockerfiles, you might want to consider using a Linux machine for your Docker work.
