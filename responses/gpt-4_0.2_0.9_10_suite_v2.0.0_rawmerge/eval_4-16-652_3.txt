AWS CLI uses a pager program to handle its output. By default, it uses the `less` program. The pager can be disabled by setting the `AWS_PAGER` environment variable to an empty string.

You can disable the pager for a single command by prefixing it with `AWS_PAGER=""`. Here's how you can modify your script:

```bash
for x in 1 2 3; do 
  AWS_PAGER="" aws sqs purge-queue --queue-url https://sqs.<aws-region>.amazonaws.com/<id>/<env>-$x-<queueName>.fifo; 
done
```

If you want to disable the pager for all AWS CLI commands in your current shell session, you can export the `AWS_PAGER` variable:

```bash
export AWS_PAGER=""
```

After running this command, all subsequent AWS CLI commands in the same shell session will not use a pager.

To disable the pager permanently, you can add the export command to your shell's profile script (e.g., `~/.bashrc` or `~/.bash_profile` for bash).

```bash
echo 'export AWS_PAGER=""' >> ~/.bashrc
```

Then, source the profile script to apply the change immediately:

```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```
