You can use the `pkg_resources` module to get the installed version of a package, and the `yolk3k` package to get the latest version available on PyPI. Here's how you can implement the `checkVersion` function:

```python
import pkg_resources
from yolk.pypi import CheeseShop

def checkVersion(pkgName):
    # Get the latest version available on PyPI
    pypi = CheeseShop()
    latest_version = pypi.query_versions_pypi(pkgName)[0][1]

    # Get the currently installed version
    installed_version = pkg_resources.get_distribution(pkgName).version

    # Return True if the installed version is the latest version, False otherwise
    return installed_version == latest_version
```

This function first queries the latest version of the package from PyPI, then gets the currently installed version of the package, and finally compares the two versions. If the installed version is the same as the latest version, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

Please note that you need to install the `yolk3k` package to use this function. You can install it with `pip install yolk3k`.

Also, please note that this function assumes that the package is already installed. If the package is not installed, `pkg_resources.get_distribution(pkgName).version` will raise a `DistributionNotFound` exception. You may want to add error handling code to deal with this situation.
