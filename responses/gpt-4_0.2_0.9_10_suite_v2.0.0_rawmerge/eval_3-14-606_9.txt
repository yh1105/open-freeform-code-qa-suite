It seems there's a misunderstanding here. iOS doesn't have a "Developer Mode" like Android. However, you can enable some developer options by using Xcode on a Mac.

Here's how you can access developer options:

1. Install Xcode on your Mac. You can download it from the Mac App Store.

2. Connect your iPhone to your Mac using a USB cable.

3. Open Xcode and go to `Window > Devices and Simulators`.

4. Select your iPhone from the list of devices.

5. Click on `Use for Development`.

This will enable some developer options on your iPhone. However, this won't allow you to install apps that are not signed by an Apple Developer account. To install such apps, you need to have the app signed by an Apple Developer account.

If you're trying to install an app that's been provisioned for testing (like an app from TestFlight), you should be able to install it without enabling any special developer options. If you're having trouble, make sure that your device's UDID is included in the provisioning profile for the app. If it's not, you'll need to add it and then recompile the app with the new provisioning profile.
