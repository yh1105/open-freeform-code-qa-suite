The error message suggests that your app isn't using AndroidX. AndroidX is a major improvement to the original Android Support Library and provides backward-compatibility for Android libraries.

To migrate your app to AndroidX, follow these steps:

1. Backup your project.
2. Open the Android project in Android Studio.
3. Select `Refactor` -> `Migrate to AndroidX` from the menu bar.
4. Click `Migrate` and accept the changes. It will refactor your project to use AndroidX.

After migrating to AndroidX, you should be able to build the Android project and generate the APK.

If you still encounter issues, make sure you have the latest versions of `gradle` and the `Android gradle plugin` in your `build.gradle` file:

```gradle
dependencies {
    classpath 'com.android.tools.build:gradle:3.5.0'
}
```

And in `gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.properties`:

```properties
distributionUrl=https\://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-5.6.2-all.zip
```

Also, check if the `.aab` file is actually being generated in the `/Users/riccardo/Desktop/QuoteFlutter/quote/build` directory as the error message suggests. If it is, there might be a problem with the tool not being able to find it.
