The error message indicates that the ffi gem is trying to load `libffi.so.6` which doesn't exist on your system. This issue might be caused by the upgrade of your OS. The new version of Ubuntu may have a different version of the libffi library.

Here are the steps to fix this issue:

1. First, you need to find out which version of libffi is installed on your system. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
find /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/ -name "libffi.so.*"
```

This command will search for all files that match the pattern `libffi.so.*` in the `/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/` directory.

2. If you see `libffi.so.7` (or any version other than `libffi.so.6`), it means that your system has a different version of libffi. In this case, you can create a symbolic link to `libffi.so.6`:

```bash
sudo ln -s /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libffi.so.7 /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libffi.so.6
```

Replace `libffi.so.7` with the version you found in the first step if it's different.

3. After creating the symbolic link, try running your rails command again. It should work now.

Please note that this is a workaround and the actual solution would be to update the ffi gem to a version that supports the libffi version installed on your system. You can do this by running `gem update ffi` in your terminal.
