The `truncate` class in TailwindCSS only works for single line text. It sets `overflow: hidden`, `text-overflow: ellipsis`, and `white-space: nowrap` on an element. So, if you want to truncate text that spans multiple lines, you'll need to use a different approach.

Unfortunately, TailwindCSS does not provide a utility for multiline text truncation out of the box. However, you can achieve this by using some custom CSS. Here's an example:

```css
.truncate-2-lines {
  display: -webkit-box;
  -webkit-line-clamp: 2;
  -webkit-box-orient: vertical;  
  overflow: hidden;
}
```

Then, you can use this class in your HTML:

```html
<div className="ml-1 inline-block">
   <span>Label: </span>
   <span className="font-semibold truncate-2-lines">
     long texttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttt
   </span>
</div>
```

This will truncate the text after 2 lines. You can adjust the number in `-webkit-line-clamp` to change the number of lines before truncation.

Please note that this solution uses `-webkit-` prefixed properties, which means it may not work in all browsers. It is supported in most modern browsers, but not in IE.
