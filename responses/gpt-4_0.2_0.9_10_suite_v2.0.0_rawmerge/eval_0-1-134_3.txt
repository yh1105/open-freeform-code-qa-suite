It sounds like you're referring to a feature provided by a tool called Emmet. Emmet is a plugin for many popular text editors that greatly improves HTML & CSS workflow. 

With Emmet you can quickly write a lot of code using abbreviations, then expand them in valid HTML tags. For example, if you type `.classname`, and then press `Tab`, it will expand to `<div class="classname"></div>`.

If this isn't working for you, it's possible that you either don't have Emmet installed, or your text editor doesn't support it. Emmet is built-in in many modern code editors like Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, Atom, Brackets, etc.

Here are some steps to troubleshoot:

1. **Check if your editor supports Emmet**: Not all text editors support Emmet. Check the list of supported editors on the [Emmet official website](https://emmet.io/).

2. **Check if Emmet is installed and enabled**: If your editor supports Emmet, make sure it's installed and enabled. The process to do this varies depending on the editor. For example, in Visual Studio Code, Emmet support is built-in and enabled by default.

3. **Check your syntax**: Make sure you're using the correct Emmet abbreviations. You can find a cheat sheet on the [Emmet official website](https://docs.emmet.io/cheat-sheet/).

4. **Check your file type**: Emmet usually works automatically in HTML and CSS files. If you're working in a different type of file, you might need to manually set the syntax to HTML or CSS.

If you're still having trouble, please provide more details about your text editor and the exact steps you're taking, and I'll be happy to help further!
