The error message is indicating that Vue.js is expecting a primitive value (string or number) as a key for the `v-for` directive, but it's getting a non-primitive value (in this case, an object) instead.

In your code, you're using `comment` as the key in your `v-for` loop:

```html
<div v-for="comment in comments" :key="comment">
```

`comment` is an object, which is a non-primitive value. Vue.js uses the `key` to track each node's identity, so it can reuse and reorder existing elements. You should use a unique primitive value (like an id or index) as the key.

If each `comment` has a unique id, you can use that as the key:

```html
<div v-for="comment in comments" :key="comment.id">
```

If there's no unique id, you can use the index of the loop:

```html
<div v-for="(comment, index) in comments" :key="index">
```

Just remember that using the index as a key only works well if your list doesn't change. If you're adding, removing, or reordering items in the list, it's better to use a unique id.
