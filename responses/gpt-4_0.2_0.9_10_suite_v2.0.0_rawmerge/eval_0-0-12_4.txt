The error message `Error: Invalid login: 535-5.7.8 Username and Password not accepted` indicates that the username and password you are using to authenticate with Gmail's SMTP server are not correct. Here are some steps you can take to resolve this issue:

1. **Check your username and password**: Make sure that the username and password you are using are correct. The username should be your full Gmail address and the password should be your Gmail password.

2. **Enable Less Secure Apps**: By default, Google blocks attempts to sign in from apps which do not use modern security standards (such as the Node.js app you are using). You can change this setting at https://www.google.com/settings/security/lesssecureapps so that your account is no longer protected by modern security standards.

3. **Use App Password**: If you have 2-Step Verification enabled for your Google account, you need to generate and use an App Password for your application. You can generate an App Password at https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords.

4. **Unlock Captcha**: Sometimes, Google may block a sign in attempt from a new location or device. You can resolve this by visiting https://accounts.google.com/DisplayUnlockCaptcha and following the prompts on the page.

Here's how you can use an App Password in your code:

```javascript
var nodemailer = require('nodemailer');

var transporter = nodemailer.createTransport({
  service: 'gmail',
  auth: {
    user: 'haideryaqoobengr@gmail.com',
    pass: 'your-app-password-here'
  }
});

var mailOptions = {
  from: 'haideryaqoobengr@gmail.com',
  to: 'haideryaqoob720@gmail.com',
  subject: 'Sending Email using Node.js',
  text: 'That was easy!'
};

transporter.sendMail(mailOptions, function(error, info){
  if (error) {
    console.log(error);
  } else {
    console.log('Email sent: ' + info.response);
  }
});
```

Replace `'your-app-password-here'` with the App Password you generated.
