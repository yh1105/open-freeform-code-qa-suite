The error message `404 Not Found: aws-sdk-js@latest` indicates that npm is unable to find the package `aws-sdk-js` in the npm registry. This is likely because there is no package with that exact name in the registry.

The AWS SDK for JavaScript is actually named `aws-sdk` in the npm registry, not `aws-sdk-js`. 

Try running the following command instead:

```bash
npm install --verbose aws-sdk
```

This should install the AWS SDK for JavaScript without any issues.
