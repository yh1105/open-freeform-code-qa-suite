The warning message you're seeing is because Elasticsearch 7.13.1 has built-in security features that are not enabled by default. Without enabling these features, your Elasticsearch cluster could be accessible to anyone.

To fix this, you need to enable Elasticsearch's built-in security features. Here are the steps to do that:

1. Open your `elasticsearch.yml` file. This file is usually located in the `config` directory of your Elasticsearch installation.

2. Add the following lines to the file:

```yaml
xpack.security.enabled: true
xpack.security.transport.ssl.enabled: true
```

3. Save the file and restart Elasticsearch.

This will enable Elasticsearch's built-in security features, including transport layer security (TLS) for communication between nodes in your cluster.

However, enabling security will require you to configure passwords for built-in users, such as the `elastic` user. You can do this by running the `elasticsearch-setup-passwords` command:

```bash
bin/elasticsearch-setup-passwords interactive
```

This command will prompt you to enter passwords for the built-in users.

Please note that enabling security might require additional configuration, depending on your setup. You can find more information in the [Elasticsearch documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.13/security-minimal-setup.html).

If you don't want to enable security and just want to suppress the warning, you can add the following line to your `elasticsearch.yml` file:

```yaml
xpack.security.enabled: false
```

This will disable the security features and suppress the warning. However, this is not recommended for production environments, as it leaves your Elasticsearch cluster unprotected.
