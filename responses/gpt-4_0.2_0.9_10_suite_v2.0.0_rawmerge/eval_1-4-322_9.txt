You can achieve this by using the `split` function in R, which splits a vector into groups determined by a factor level. Here is the function you requested:

```r
library(tidyverse)

myConvert <- function(my_data) {
  my_data %>%
    split(.$list_names) %>%
    map(~.$list_values)
}
```

In this function, we first split the `my_data` tibble by the `list_names` column. This creates a list of tibbles, each named by the unique values in `list_names`. Then, we use `map` to extract the `list_values` from each tibble, resulting in a named list of character vectors.

You can test this function with your example data:

```r
my_data <- tibble(list_names = c("Ford", "Chevy", "Ford", "Dodge", "Dodge", "Ford"),
                  list_values = c("Ranger", "Equinox", "F150", "Caravan", "Ram", "Explorer"))

myConvert(my_data)
```

This should give you the desired output.
