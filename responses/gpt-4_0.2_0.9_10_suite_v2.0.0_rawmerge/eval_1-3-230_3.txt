The `_io.BytesIO` object is a stream of bytes in memory. To convert it to a bytes-like object, you need to read from the stream. You can do this using the `read()` method. Here's how you can modify your function:

```python
def uncompress_body(self, compression_type, body):
    # If body is a BytesIO object, read it into a bytes object
    if isinstance(body, io.BytesIO):
        body = body.read()

    if compression_type == 'gzip' or compression_type == 'compress':
        return zlib.decompress(body)
    elif compression_type == 'deflate':
        compressor = zlib.compressobj(9, zlib.DEFLATED, -zlib.MAX_WBITS)
        compressed = compressor.compress(body)
        compressed += compressor.flush()
        return base64.b64encode(compressed)

    return body
```

This will read the entire stream into a bytes object, which can then be passed to `zlib.decompress()`.
