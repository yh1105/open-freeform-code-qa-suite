In R, you cannot have two columns with the same name in a data frame. When you try to bind two data frames with the same column names using `cbind()`, R will automatically rename the columns to make them unique. 

In your case, the column names of `d3` will be `a` and `a.1`, not `a` and `a`. You can check this by using `colnames(d3)`.

To select the second column by name, you can use the `$` operator or the `[[` operator with the correct column name. Here is how you can do it:

```r
second_col <- d3$a.1
```

or 

```r
second_col <- d3[["a.1"]]
```

Both of these will assign the second column of `d3` to the variable `second_col`.
