Yes, there is a better way to do this in Rust. You can use the `?` operator to make your code cleaner and more readable. The `?` operator is used for error propagation. When used in a function that returns `Result` or `Option`, it will return early if the function it is called on returns `Err` or `None`.

Here's how you can refactor your code:

```rust
fn main() {
    match func1().and_then(func2).and_then(func3).and_then(func4) {
        Some(result) => {
            // Do something with result
        },
        None => println!("One of the functions returned None"),
    }
}

fn func1() -> Option<i32> {
    // Your code here
}

fn func2(i: i32) -> Option<i32> {
    // Your code here
}

fn func3(j: i32) -> Option<i32> {
    // Your code here
}

fn func4(k: i32) -> Option<i32> {
    // Your code here
}
```

In this refactored code, `and_then` is used to chain the functions together. If any of the functions return `None`, the chain will stop and `None` will be returned. If all functions return `Some`, the final result will be `Some`.

Please note that this refactoring assumes that `func2`, `func3`, and `func4` all take a single argument of the same type and return an `Option` of the same type. If this is not the case, you may need to adjust the refactoring accordingly.

Also, this refactoring loses the specific error messages for each function. If you need to keep those, you might want to consider using `Result` instead of `Option` and return specific error messages.
