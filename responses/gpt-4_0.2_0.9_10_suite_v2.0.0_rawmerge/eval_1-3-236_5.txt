It seems like you're trying to disable Jedi in Visual Studio Code. The setting you're trying to change is not for linting but for IntelliSense.

To disable Jedi, you should add the following line to your settings.json file:

```json
"python.jediEnabled": false
```

If you want to use Pylint for linting, you should also ensure that you have the following line in your settings.json file:

```json
"python.linting.pylintEnabled": true
```

If the lines are greyed out, it means they are not active. You should make sure that there are no comments (`//`) before these lines.

Also, make sure that Pylint is installed in your Python environment. You can install it using pip:

```bash
pip install pylint
```

After making these changes, you may need to reload Visual Studio Code for the changes to take effect.
