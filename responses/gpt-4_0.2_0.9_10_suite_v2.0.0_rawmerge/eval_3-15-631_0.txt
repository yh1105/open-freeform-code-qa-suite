You can achieve this by simply removing the space character from your replacement string. In your case, you are replacing special characters with a space (" "). If you want to remove the special characters without leaving a space, you should replace them with an empty string ("").

Here is the modified code:

```vba
Sub ReplaceSpecial()
    Dim cel As Range
    Dim strVal As String
    Dim i As Long
    Application.ScreenUpdating = False
    For Each cel In Selection
        strVal = cel.Value
        For i = 1 To Len(strVal)
            Select Case Asc(Mid(strVal, i, 1))
                Case 48 To 57, 65 To 90, 97 To 122
                    ' Leave ordinary characters alone
                Case Else
                    Mid(strVal, i, 1) = ""
            End Select
        Next i
        cel.Value = strVal
    Next cel
    Application.ScreenUpdating = True
End Sub
```

Please note that this code will not work as expected because `Mid` function is not able to replace the character in the string with an empty string. To overcome this, you can use the `Replace` function to replace the space with an empty string after the `For` loop.

Here is the corrected code:

```vba
Sub ReplaceSpecial()
    Dim cel As Range
    Dim strVal As String
    Dim i As Long
    Application.ScreenUpdating = False
    For Each cel In Selection
        strVal = cel.Value
        For i = 1 To Len(strVal)
            Select Case Asc(Mid(strVal, i, 1))
                Case 48 To 57, 65 To 90, 97 To 122
                    ' Leave ordinary characters alone
                Case Else
                    Mid(strVal, i, 1) = " "
            End Select
        Next i
        cel.Value = Replace(strVal, " ", "")
    Next cel
    Application.ScreenUpdating = True
End Sub
```

This will replace all special characters with an empty string, effectively removing them from the string.
