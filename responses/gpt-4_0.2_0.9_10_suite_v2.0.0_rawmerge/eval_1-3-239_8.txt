Sure, here is a simple bash script to install a specific version of Python using Homebrew:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Unlink the current version of Python
brew unlink python

# Install the required version
brew install python@3.6

# Link the installed version
brew link --force python@3.6
```

Please note that this script will unlink the current version of Python and link the version 3.6.5. If you have other Python versions installed, you might need to adjust the script accordingly.
