The `dd()` function in Laravel is a helper function that stands for "dump and die". It's used to dump a variable's contents to the browser and stop further script execution. However, it has a limitation when it comes to large and complex data structures, as it can cause the browser to crash or hang due to the amount of data being output.

To overcome this, you can use alternative methods to inspect your data:

1. **Laravel Debugbar**: This package adds a developer toolbar to your app for debugging. It can handle large data structures better than `dd()`. You can install it via composer:

    ```bash
    composer require barryvdh/laravel-debugbar --dev
    ```

    Then you can use the `Debugbar` facade to add messages:

    ```php
    \Debugbar::info($object);
    \Debugbar::error('Error!');
    \Debugbar::warning('Watch outâ€¦');
    \Debugbar::addMessage(['my' => 'message'], 'mylabel');
    ```

2. **Logging**: Instead of dumping the data to the browser, you can write it to the log file. This can handle much larger data structures:

    ```php
    \Log::info(print_r($yourVariable, true));
    ```

    This will write the data to your log file, which you can view in `storage/logs/laravel.log`.

3. **Pagination**: If you're dealing with a lot of Eloquent models, consider using Laravel's built-in pagination to limit the number of results:

    ```php
    $users = DB::table('users')->paginate(15);
    ```

4. **Breaking down your data**: If your data structure is too large, consider breaking it down into smaller chunks and inspecting them separately.

Remember, `dd()` and similar functions are great for quick debugging, but for larger applications and more complex data structures, consider using more robust debugging tools like Xdebug or Laravel Debugbar.
