The `rename` function is used to rename the DataFrame's index or columns. However, in your case, you are trying to rename the column of a Series object, not a DataFrame. The `groupby` operation followed by the `mean` function returns a Series, not a DataFrame.

Here's how you can modify your function to rename the column:

```python
def renameDataFrame(df):
    avg = df.groupby(["t"], sort=False)["p"].mean().reset_index()
    avg.columns = ['t', 'mean']
    return avg
```

In this function, `reset_index` is used to convert the Series to a DataFrame. Then, you can rename the column by assigning a new list of column names to `avg.columns`.

Here's how you can use this function:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

datain = np.array([[1, 2, 3, 4, 5], [1, 3, 4, 5, 6], [2, 4, 5, 6, 7]])
df = pd.DataFrame(data = datain, columns = ["t","p","x","y","z"])

print(renameDataFrame(df))
```

This will print:

```
   t  mean
0  1   2.5
1  2   4.0
```

In this output, the 'mean' column represents the mean of 'p' values grouped by 't'.
