It seems like there's a bit of confusion here. iOS doesn't have a "Developer Mode" like Android does. However, if you're trying to run a provisioned testing build, you'll need to have the device registered with your Apple Developer account and the app signed with a provisioning profile that includes that device.

Here are the steps to do this:

1. **Register your device with your Apple Developer account:**

   - Connect your device to your Mac.
   - Open Xcode.
   - Go to `Window > Devices and Simulators`.
   - Select your device from the list on the left.
   - Click the `+` button under the `Devices` section.
   - Your device's UDID should be filled in automatically. Give it a name and click `Add`.

2. **Create a provisioning profile that includes your device:**

   - Go to the [Apple Developer website](https://developer.apple.com/account/).
   - Click `Certificates, Identifiers & Profiles`.
   - Under `Profiles`, click the `+` button to create a new profile.
   - Select `iOS App Development` (or another type if appropriate for your app) and click `Continue`.
   - Select the App ID for your app and click `Continue`.
   - Select the certificates you want to include in the profile and click `Continue`.
   - Select the devices you want to include in the profile (including the one you just registered) and click `Continue`.
   - Give the profile a name and click `Generate`.
   - Download the profile and double-click it to install it in Xcode.

3. **Sign your app with the new provisioning profile:**

   - In Xcode, select your project in the Project Navigator.
   - Select your target in the Targets list.
   - Go to the `Signing & Capabilities` tab.
   - Select the `Manual` option under `Provisioning Profile`.
   - Select the profile you just created from the dropdown list.

After doing this, you should be able to install and run your app on your device. If you're still having trouble, make sure that the build you're trying to run is signed with the correct provisioning profile and that the device is included in that profile.
