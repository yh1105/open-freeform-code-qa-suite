The `ext-zip` is a PHP extension for handling zip archives. It's not a package that you can install via composer. The error message you're seeing is because composer is trying to find a package named `ext-zip`, but it doesn't exist.

If you're on a Unix-like system (like Linux or MacOS), you can install the zip extension with the following command:

```bash
sudo apt-get install php-zip
```

Or if you're using PHP 7.2, use:

```bash
sudo apt-get install php7.2-zip
```

If you're on Windows, you'll need to enable the extension in your `php.ini` file. You can do this by removing the semicolon from the start of the line that reads `;extension=php_zip.dll`.

After installing or enabling the zip extension, you should restart your web server to make sure the new extension is loaded.

Then, you can add the requirement for the zip extension in your `composer.json` file like this:

```json
"require": {
    "php": "^7.1.3",
    "ext-zip": "*",
    // other dependencies...
}
```

This tells composer that your project requires the zip extension for PHP, but it doesn't try to install it. It's just for information purposes.
