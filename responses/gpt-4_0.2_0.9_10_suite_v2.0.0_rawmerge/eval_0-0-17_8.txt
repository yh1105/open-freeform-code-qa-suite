Sure, you can use the `keydown` event to listen for the "enter" key. Here's how you can modify your code:

```javascript
mounted() {
  let editor = new Editor({
    extensions: [
      StarterKit,
      Keymap({
        "Enter": () => {
          console.log("good");
          return true;
        }
      })
    ],
    content: this.value
  });
  this.editor = editor;
}
```

In this code, we're using the `Keymap` extension to listen for the "Enter" key. When the "Enter" key is pressed, it will execute `console.log("good")`.
