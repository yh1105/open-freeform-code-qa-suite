The issue you're experiencing is a known bug in Safari where flex children don't respect `height: auto` in the way you might expect. 

To fix this, you can add `align-self: flex-start` to the image. This will align the image at the start of the cross axis, which is vertical in your case because you're using `flex-direction: column`.

Here's the updated CSS:

```css
.container {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
}

.container section:first-child {
  display: flex;
  margin-bottom: 25px;
}

.container img {
  width: 125px;
  height: auto;
  align-self: flex-start; /* Add this line */
}
```

This should ensure that your images aren't stretched and maintain their aspect ratio.
