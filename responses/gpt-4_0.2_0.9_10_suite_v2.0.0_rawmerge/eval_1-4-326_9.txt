You can use the `gsub` function in R to replace the commas inside the quotes. The `gsub` function is used for replacement of all matches (not just the first match) in a string or character vector.

Here is a function that uses a regular expression to match a comma that is inside quotes and replace it with a space:

```r
removeComma <- function(s) {
  gsub('(?<=")[^"]*"', gsub(",", " ", "\\0"), s, perl = TRUE)
}
```

This function works by first matching any text that is inside quotes (using the `(?<=")[^"]*"` regular expression), and then replacing any commas in that matched text with a space.

Here's how you can use this function with your example:

```r
string <- c("1, 2, \"something, else\"", "3, 5, \"more, more, more\"", "6, \"commas, are fun\", \"no, they are not\"")

removeComma(string)
```

This will give you the desired output:

```r
[1] "1, 2, \"something else\""                  
[2] "3, 5, \"more more more\""                  
[3] "6, \"commas are fun\", \"no they are not\""
```
