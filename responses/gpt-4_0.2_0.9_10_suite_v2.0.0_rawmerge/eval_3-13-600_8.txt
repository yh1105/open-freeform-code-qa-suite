You can disable the swipe animation in ViewPager2 by using a custom `ViewPager2.PageTransformer`. Here's an example:

```java
viewPager2.setPageTransformer(new ViewPager2.PageTransformer() {
    @Override
    public void transformPage(@NonNull View page, float position) {
        if (position <= -1 || position >= 1) {
            // Page is not visible -- stop any running animations
            page.clearAnimation();
        } else if (position == 0) {
            // Page is selected -- reset any views if necessary
            page.clearAnimation();
        }
    }
});
```

This will instantly switch to the new page without any animations. 

However, please note that this will also disable the swipe gesture to change pages. If you want to keep the swipe gesture but without the animation, you may need to create a custom `ViewPager2` and override the `smoothScrollToPosition` method to call `scrollToPosition` instead.
