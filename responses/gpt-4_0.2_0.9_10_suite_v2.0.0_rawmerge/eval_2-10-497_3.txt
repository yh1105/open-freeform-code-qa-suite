In Rust, the `Box<T>` type is a smart pointer that points to data on the heap. It cannot be null. If you want to have an optional `Box`, you should use the `Option<Box<T>>` type. This type can be `Some(box)` or `None`.

Here's how you can modify your `Node` and `Stack` structures to use `Option<Box<Node>>`:

```rust
struct Node {
    value: i32,
    next: Option<Box<Node>>,
}

struct Stack {
    top: Option<Box<Node>>,
}
```

Now, you can check if the `top` of the stack is `None` (which would be similar to a null pointer in other languages):

```rust
if let Some(node) = &stack.top {
    // The stack is not empty, do something with `node`
} else {
    // The stack is empty
}
```

Or, using `match`:

```rust
match &stack.top {
    Some(node) => {
        // The stack is not empty, do something with `node`
    },
    None => {
        // The stack is empty
    }
}
```

In Rust, you generally don't deal with raw pointers and nullability like you would in C or C++. Instead, you use types like `Option` and `Result` to handle the possibility of absence or failure.
