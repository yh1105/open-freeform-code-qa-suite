The issue you're facing is due to the fact that the `GestureDetector` is only wrapping the `QQBody` widget, which in turn only contains a `Text` widget. This means that the tap detection is only active where the `Text` widget is present on the screen.

To make the entire screen tappable, you can wrap the `Scaffold` widget with the `GestureDetector` widget. Here's how you can do it:

```dart
class QQHome extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      debugShowCheckedModeBanner: false,
      theme: ThemeData(
        primaryColor: Colors.blueGrey,
      ),
      home: GestureDetector(
        onTap: () => print('Tapped'),
        child: Scaffold(
          appBar: AppBar(
            centerTitle: true,
            title: Text('QuoteQuota'),
          ),
          body: QQBody(),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class QQBody extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Center(
      child: Text(
        'Hello, World!'
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

Now, the `GestureDetector` is wrapping the entire `Scaffold`, which includes the `AppBar` and the `Body`. This means that a tap anywhere on the screen will trigger the `onTap` function and print 'Tapped'.
