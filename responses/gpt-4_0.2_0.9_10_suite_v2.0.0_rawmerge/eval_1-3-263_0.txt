The `f` before the string in the `print` function is used to denote an f-string (formatted string literal) in Python. It's a way to embed expressions inside string literals, using curly braces `{}`. The expressions will be replaced with their values when the string is printed.

In your example:

```python
print(f"Input directory: {args.input_directory}")
print(f"Output directory: {args.output_directory}")
```

`{args.input_directory}` and `{args.output_directory}` are expressions embedded in the f-string. The values of these expressions (which are the input and output directory paths, respectively) will be inserted into the string at those positions when the string is printed.

So, if `args.input_directory` is `/path/to/input` and `args.output_directory` is `/path/to/output`, the output of these print statements will be:

```
Input directory: /path/to/input
Output directory: /path/to/output
```

F-strings are a feature introduced in Python 3.6 and are a more concise and convenient way to embed expressions inside string literals for formatting.
