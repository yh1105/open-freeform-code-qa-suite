You can use `awk` to extract the language code from the `lang` attribute. Here's how you can do it:

```bash
curl -Ls stick-it.app | grep -o 'lang="[a-zA-Z-]*"' | cut -d'"' -f2
```

This command does the following:

- `curl -Ls stick-it.app` fetches the HTML of the page.
- `grep -o 'lang="[a-zA-Z-]*"'` extracts the `lang` attribute from the HTML. The `-o` option tells `grep` to only output the matches, not the entire line. The regular expression `'lang="[a-zA-Z-]*"'` matches the `lang` attribute and its value.
- `cut -d'"' -f2` splits the output on the `"` character and selects the second field, which is the language code.

This command should work regardless of where the `lang` attribute is located in the `<html>` tag.
