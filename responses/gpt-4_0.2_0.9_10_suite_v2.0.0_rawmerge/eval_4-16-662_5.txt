You can use `jq` command-line JSON processor to minify JSON in a shell script. `jq` is a lightweight and flexible command-line JSON processor. It is like `sed` for JSON data.

Here is an example of how you can use it:

```bash
echo '{
    "foo": "lorem",
    "bar": "ipsum"
}' | jq -c .
```

This will output:

```bash
{"foo":"lorem","bar":"ipsum"}
```

The `-c` option in `jq` command stands for compact output. It will ensure that the output JSON is in one line.

If you don't have `jq` installed, you can install it using the package manager for your system. For example, on Ubuntu, you can install it with `sudo apt-get install jq`. On macOS, you can install it with `brew install jq`.
