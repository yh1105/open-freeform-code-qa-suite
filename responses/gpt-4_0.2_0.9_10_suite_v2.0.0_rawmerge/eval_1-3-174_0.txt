The error message `ImportError: DLL load failed while importing _psycopg: The operating system cannot run %1.` indicates that the psycopg2 library is having trouble finding the necessary DLL files to run.

Here are a few things you can try to resolve this issue:

1. **Reinstall psycopg2-binary**: Sometimes, the issue can be resolved by installing the binary package of psycopg2, which includes the necessary DLL files. You can do this by running the following command:

```bash
pip install psycopg2-binary
```

2. **Check your PATH**: Make sure that the necessary DLL files are in your PATH. The psycopg2 library requires the PostgreSQL client libraries to run, so you need to make sure that the PostgreSQL bin directory is in your PATH. You can do this by adding the following line to your script:

```python
import os
os.environ['PATH'] = r'C:\path\to\your\postgresql\bin;' + os.environ['PATH']
```

Replace `'C:\path\to\your\postgresql\bin'` with the actual path to your PostgreSQL bin directory.

3. **Check your PostgreSQL installation**: If you're still having trouble, it might be worth checking your PostgreSQL installation. Make sure that you have the correct version of PostgreSQL installed and that it's properly configured.

4. **Check your Python and psycopg2 versions**: Make sure that your Python version is compatible with the psycopg2 version you're using. If you're using a 64-bit version of Python, you need to use a 64-bit version of psycopg2, and vice versa.

If none of these solutions work, please provide more information about your system setup (Python version, psycopg2 version, PostgreSQL version, etc.) so we can better assist you.
