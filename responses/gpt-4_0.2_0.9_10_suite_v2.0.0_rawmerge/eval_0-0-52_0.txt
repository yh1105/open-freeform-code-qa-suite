The Angular CLI does not provide a specific command to remove a package. However, you can remove a package manually by following these steps:

1. Open your `package.json` file.

2. Find the package you want to remove in the `dependencies` or `devDependencies` section.

3. Delete the line that contains the package.

4. Save the `package.json` file.

5. Run the following command in your terminal to update your `node_modules`:

```bash
npm install
```

Alternatively, you can use npm or yarn to remove the package:

- If you are using npm, run the following command:

```bash
npm uninstall <package-name>
```

- If you are using yarn, run the following command:

```bash
yarn remove <package-name>
```

Remember to replace `<package-name>` with the name of the package you want to remove.
