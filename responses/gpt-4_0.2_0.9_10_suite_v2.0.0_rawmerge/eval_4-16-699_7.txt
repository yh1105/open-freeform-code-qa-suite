You can use the `-split` operator in PowerShell to split the string at the `-354` sequence and then take the first part. Here is how you can do it:

```powershell
$FileArray = @("Name1-354-03.pdf", "Name23-354-H11.pdf", "Name354-354-02.pdf", "Name3545-354.pdf")
ForEach ($n in $FileArray){
    $split = $n -split '-354', 2
    Write-Host ($split[0] + '-354')
}
```

In this script, `-split '-354', 2` splits the string into two parts at the `-354` sequence. `$split[0]` is the part before `-354` and then we append `-354` to it.

This will give you the output:

```
Name1-354
Name23-354
Name354-354
Name3545-354
```

This script assumes that `-354` will always be present in the string. If `-354` might not be present, you should add a check for that.
