Yes, you can convert your OpenSSH private key to a traditional RSA private key using the `ssh-keygen` tool. Here's how:

1. Convert OpenSSH private key to RSA private key:

```bash
ssh-keygen -p -m PEM -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```

This command will ask you to enter a passphrase. If you don't want to use a passphrase, just press enter when prompted.

This command will not change the public key, so you don't need to send the public key to the server administrator again.

2. You don't need to convert the public key. The public key format is standard and doesn't have different formats like the private key. The public key doesn't have a header like the private key, it's just a single line of text.

Please note that this command will overwrite your existing private key. If you want to keep your existing OpenSSH private key, you should make a backup before running this command.
