Use `WillPopScope` instead of `Navigator.pop(context)` or `Navigator.of(context).pop()`. 

The `WillPopScope` widget intercepts the back button press event and you can decide what to do when the back button is pressed. In your case, you can simply return `false` to disable the back button. Here's a sample code:

```dart
return new WillPopScope(
    onWillPop: () async => false,
    child: Scaffold(
      // your widget here
    )
);
```

In this code, `onWillPop` is a callback that is called when the user attempts to pop the current route. By returning `false`, you're saying that the route should not be popped (i.e., the back button should not do anything).
