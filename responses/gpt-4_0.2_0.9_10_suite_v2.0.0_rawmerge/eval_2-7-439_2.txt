The `ext-zip` is a PHP extension for handling zip archives. It's not a package that you can install via composer. The error message you're seeing is because composer is trying to find a package named `ext-zip` and failing because it doesn't exist.

If you're on a Unix-like operating system (like Ubuntu), you can install the zip extension with the following command:

```bash
sudo apt-get install php-zip
```

If you're on Windows, you can enable the extension by editing your `php.ini` file and uncommenting the line that looks like this:

```bash
;extension=php_zip.dll
```

Just remove the semicolon at the start of the line and save the file. Then, restart your web server for the changes to take effect.

After you've installed or enabled the zip extension, you can tell composer that it's installed by adding it to the `require` section of your `composer.json` file like this:

```json
"require": {
    "php": "^7.1.3",
    "ext-zip": "*",
    // other dependencies...
}
```

Then run `composer update` to update your project's dependencies.
