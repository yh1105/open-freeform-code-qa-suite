The error message you're seeing is due to a change in Spring Cloud 2020.0.2. The `spring.config.import` property is now required for the Config Server client to work properly. However, since you're not using Config Server, you shouldn't need to set this property.

The problem is that you have the `spring-cloud-starter-config` dependency in your `build.gradle` file. This dependency is used for connecting to a Config Server, and it's causing Spring Boot to look for the `spring.config.import` property.

Since you're not using Config Server, you can remove the `spring-cloud-starter-config` dependency from your `build.gradle` file:

```groovy
dependencies {
    // ...
    // Remove this line:
    // implementation('org.springframework.cloud:spring-cloud-starter-config')
    // ...
}
```

After removing this dependency, try rebuilding your project. The error should no longer occur.

If you're actually using Config Server in some parts of your project and you need to keep the `spring-cloud-starter-config` dependency, you'll need to set the `spring.config.import` property to the URL of your Config Server. For example:

```properties
spring.config.import=configserver:http://my-config-server.com
```

If you're not using Config Server at all, it's best to remove the `spring-cloud-starter-config` dependency to avoid confusion.
