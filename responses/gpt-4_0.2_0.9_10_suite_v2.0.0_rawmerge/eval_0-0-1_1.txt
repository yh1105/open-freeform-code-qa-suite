The 404 error you're experiencing might be due to a number of reasons. Here are some steps you can take to debug and potentially fix the issue:

1. **Check your build command:** Make sure your build command is correct in your `package.json` file. It should be `"build": "next build"`.

2. **Check your output directory:** By default, Next.js generates the production build files in the `.next` folder. However, Vercel expects the output files to be in the `out` directory. You can change this by adding a `vercel.json` file in your project root with the following content:

    ```json
    {
      "version": 2,
      "builds": [
        {
          "src": "package.json",
          "use": "@vercel/next"
        }
      ]
    }
    ```

3. **Check your dynamic routes:** If you're using dynamic routes, make sure you're using `getStaticPaths` and `getStaticProps` (or `getServerSideProps` if necessary) correctly. If you're using `getStaticPaths`, ensure you're returning all necessary paths. If you're using `fallback: true`, make sure your component can handle the loading state.

4. **Check your public files:** If you have a `public` directory in your project, make sure that the files you're trying to access are there. Vercel will serve these files from the root URL, so `public/myfile.txt` will be available at `https://your-domain.com/myfile.txt`.

5. **Check your logs:** Check the build logs in Vercel. They might give you more information about what's going wrong. You can access them from your Vercel dashboard.

6. **Check your dependencies:** Make sure all your dependencies are listed in `package.json` and that you're not relying on any global packages that might not be present in the Vercel environment.

7. **Upgrade Next.js:** There might be a bug in the version of Next.js you're using. Try upgrading to the latest version.

If none of these steps help, you might want to consider creating a minimal reproduction of your issue and asking for help on the Vercel support or the Next.js GitHub page.
