The error message is telling you that you cannot create an index on a navigation property. Indexes in Entity Framework are for columns in the database, and a navigation property does not correspond to a database column. 

You should create an index on the foreign key property `GenderId` instead of the navigation property `Gender`. 

Here's how you can correct your `OnModelCreating` method:

```c#
protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder modelBuilder)
{
    modelBuilder.Entity<User>(user =>
    {
        user
        .HasOne(x => x.Gender)
        .WithMany(x => x.Users)
        .HasForeignKey(x => x.GenderId);

        user.HasIndex(x => x.GenderId);
    });
}
```

This way, you're creating an index on the `GenderId` column of the `User` table, which is the correct way to speed up lookups when you're querying users by their gender.
