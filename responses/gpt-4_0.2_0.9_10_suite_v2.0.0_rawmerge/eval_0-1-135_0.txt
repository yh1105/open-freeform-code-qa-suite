Yes, Safari has some issues with flexbox and images. The problem is that Safari doesn't seem to respect the `height: auto` for images in a flex container. 

To fix this, you can add `align-self: flex-start` to the image. This will align the image at the start of the cross axis, which is the vertical axis in this case, and prevent it from stretching.

Here's the updated CSS:

```css
.container {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
}

.container section:first-child {
  display: flex;
  margin-bottom: 25px;
}

.container img {
  width: 125px;
  height: auto;
  align-self: flex-start; /* Add this line */
}
```

This should make the image display correctly in Safari.
