Angular CLI doesn't provide a specific command to remove a package. However, you can remove a package manually by following these steps:

1. Open your `package.json` file.

2. Find the package you want to remove in the `dependencies` or `devDependencies` section.

3. Delete the line that contains the package.

4. Save the `package.json` file.

5. Run `npm install` in your terminal. This command will update your `node_modules` folder according to the changes you made in the `package.json` file.

Alternatively, you can use npm or yarn to remove a package:

- For npm, use the command `npm uninstall <package>`.
- For yarn, use the command `yarn remove <package>`.

These commands will remove the package from `node_modules` and `package.json` file.
