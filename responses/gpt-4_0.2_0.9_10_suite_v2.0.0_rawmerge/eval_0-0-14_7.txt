Sure, you can use the `onChange` event of the `Switch` component to update the form value. Here's how you can do it:

```jsx
<Form.Item name="switch" valuePropName="checked">
  <Switch
    checkedChildren="Yes"
    unCheckedChildren="No"
    onChange={(checked) => {
      form.setFieldsValue({ switch: checked });
    }}
  />
  <span>Chargable</span>
</Form.Item>
```

In this code, whenever the switch is toggled, the `onChange` event is triggered and the form value for the switch is updated with the current state of the switch.
