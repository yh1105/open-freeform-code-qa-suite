The error log indicates that `node-gyp` is unable to find Python in your system. `node-gyp` is a cross-platform command-line tool written in Node.js for compiling native addon modules for Node.js, which requires Python, among other dependencies.

Here are the steps to fix this issue:

1. Install Python 2.7, and add it to your PATH, npm config set python python2.7
2. Install Microsoft Visual Studio C++ 2013 (or later). You can download it from [here](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/older-downloads/). This is required to compile modules.
3. Run `npm config set msvs_version 2013` --global (or the version you have installed)

If you have multiple Python versions installed, you can identify which Python version `node-gyp` should use in Windows by setting the `npm` config variable `python`:

```bash
npm config set python /path/to/executable/python2.7
```

Then, try to rebuild the package or re-run `npm install`.

If the problem persists, you can try to install `windows-build-tools` which installs Python 2.7 and all the required compile tools. Run this command in PowerShell as Administrator:

```bash
npm install --global --production windows-build-tools
```

This will set up everything needed for `node-gyp` to run properly on your system.
