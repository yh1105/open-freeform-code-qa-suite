The error message you're seeing is because ESLint is trying to find the `tsconfig.json` file in the same directory as the `.eslintrc.js` file, but it's not there.

You can fix this by providing the correct path to your `tsconfig.json` file in the `.eslintrc.js` file. 

Here's how you can do it:

```javascript
parserOptions: {
  project: "./tsconfig.json", // add the correct path here
  sourceType: "module",
},
```

The `./` means that the `tsconfig.json` file is in the same directory as the `.eslintrc.js` file. If your `tsconfig.json` file is in a different directory, you'll need to adjust the path accordingly.

For example, if your `tsconfig.json` file is in a directory named `config` that's in the same directory as the `.eslintrc.js` file, you'd use `"./config/tsconfig.json"`.

After making this change, you should restart your IDE or text editor to ensure the changes are picked up.

If you're still having trouble, you might want to check if there are any syntax errors in your `tsconfig.json` file that could be causing the parsing error. You can use a JSON validator to check for syntax errors.
