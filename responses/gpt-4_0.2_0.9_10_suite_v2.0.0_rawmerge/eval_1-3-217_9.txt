You can use the `torch.cat` function to concatenate the tensors along a new dimension. However, before you can do this, you need to ensure that both tensors have the same number of dimensions. You can add an extra dimension to `d` using `unsqueeze`.

Here is the function you asked for:

```python
import torch

def addTensor(inps, d):
    # Add an extra dimension to d
    d = d.unsqueeze(2)
    # Concatenate along the 3rd dimension
    result = torch.cat((inps, d), 2)
    return result
```

This function first adds an extra dimension to `d` to make it a [64, 161, 1] tensor. Then it concatenates `inps` and `d` along the third dimension to create a new tensor of size [64, 161, 2].
