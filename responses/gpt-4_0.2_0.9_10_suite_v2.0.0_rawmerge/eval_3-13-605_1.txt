The error message you're seeing is due to a mismatch between the Kotlin version used to compile the Stripe library and the Kotlin version in your project. 

To resolve this issue, you need to update the Kotlin version in your project to match the one used by the Stripe library. Here are the steps to do that:

1. Open your project's root `build.gradle` file.
2. In the `buildscript` block, find the `ext.kotlin_version` line and change the version to '1.5.1' (or the latest version if it's higher). It should look something like this:

```gradle
buildscript {
    ext.kotlin_version = '1.5.1'
    ...
}
```

3. Also, make sure that the Kotlin Gradle plugin version matches the Kotlin version. In the `dependencies` block of the `buildscript`, it should look like this:

```gradle
dependencies {
    classpath "org.jetbrains.kotlin:kotlin-gradle-plugin:$kotlin_version"
    ...
}
```

4. Sync your project with the Gradle files.

As for adding the email and cardholder name in Stripe, the `CardMultilineWidget` does not support these fields. You'll have to create separate input fields for the email and cardholder name in your app's UI and handle them separately. 

You can use `EditText` views for these fields and then collect the data from these fields when the user submits the form. Here's a basic example:

```xml
<EditText
    android:id="@+id/emailEditText"
    android:layout_width="match_parent"
    android:layout_height="wrap_content"
    android:inputType="textEmailAddress"
    android:hint="Email"/>

<EditText
    android:id="@+id/cardholderNameEditText"
    android:layout_width="match_parent"
    android:layout_height="wrap_content"
    android:inputType="textPersonName"
    android:hint="Cardholder Name"/>
```

In your activity or fragment, you can get the text from these fields like this:

```kotlin
val email = findViewById<EditText>(R.id.emailEditText).text.toString()
val cardholderName = findViewById<EditText>(R.id.cardholderNameEditText).text.toString()
```

Remember to validate these fields before proceeding with the payment process.
