You can achieve this by simply not replacing the special characters with a space, but with an empty string. Here is your updated code:

```vba
Sub ReplaceSpecial()
    Dim cel As Range
    Dim strVal As String
    Dim i As Long
    Application.ScreenUpdating = False
    For Each cel In Selection
        strVal = cel.Value
        For i = 1 To Len(strVal)
            Select Case Asc(Mid(strVal, i, 1))
                Case 48 To 57, 65 To 90, 97 To 122
                    ' Leave ordinary characters alone
                Case Else
                    Mid(strVal, i, 1) = ""
            End Select
        Next i
        cel.Value = strVal
    Next cel
    Application.ScreenUpdating = True
End Sub
```

Please note that I removed `32` from the `Select Case` statement. ASCII 32 is the space character, so if you want to remove spaces as well, you should not include it in the list of characters to leave alone.
