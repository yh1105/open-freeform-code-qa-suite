You can use Python's multiprocessing module to run these two processes concurrently. Here's how you can modify your code:

```python
import multiprocessing
from dash import Dash
import dash_bootstrap_components as dbc
import db
import hp
import fd

app = Dash(__name__, external_stylesheets=[dbc.themes.BOOTSTRAP])
database=db.dataBase()
homepage=hp.homepage(database)
homepage.timeUpdateCallback(app)
homepage.gaugeRefreshCallback(app)

def run_dash():
    app.layout = homepage.layoutMaker()
    app.run_server(debug=True)

def run_data_mining():
    fd.financeData(database,1600)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Create processes
    p1 = multiprocessing.Process(target=run_dash)
    p2 = multiprocessing.Process(target=run_data_mining)

    # Start processes
    p1.start()
    p2.start()

    # Join processes
    p1.join()
    p2.join()
```

This will create two separate processes, one for the Dash server and one for the data mining script. They will run independently of each other, allowing your Dash server to update in real time as your data mining script writes to the database.

Please note that multiprocessing has its own set of challenges, such as managing shared state and handling process communication. Make sure to handle any exceptions that might occur in either of the processes to avoid any unexpected behavior.
