The error message indicates that the zlib library, which is a required dependency when compiling Pillow from source, could not be found. 

However, the Pillow version you are trying to install (6.0.0) does not support Python 3.8 as mentioned in the error message. 

You can try to install a newer version of Pillow that supports Python 3.8. 

To do this, you can use the following command:

```bash
pip install Pillow --upgrade
```

This command will upgrade Pillow to the latest version that supports your Python version.

If you still encounter issues, you might want to consider using a Python version that is fully supported by the Pillow version you want to use.
