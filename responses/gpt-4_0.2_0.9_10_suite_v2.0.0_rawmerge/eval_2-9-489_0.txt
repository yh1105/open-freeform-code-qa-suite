The warning you're seeing is because Elasticsearch 7.13.1 has built-in security features that are not enabled by default. This means that without authentication, your Elasticsearch cluster could be accessible to anyone.

Here are the steps to enable Elasticsearch security features:

1. Open your `elasticsearch.yml` configuration file. This file is usually located in the `/etc/elasticsearch` or `/usr/local/etc/elasticsearch` directory.

2. Add the following lines to the `elasticsearch.yml` file:

    ```yml
    xpack.security.enabled: true
    xpack.security.transport.ssl.enabled: true
    ```

3. Save the changes and close the file.

4. Restart Elasticsearch. The command to restart Elasticsearch depends on how you installed it. Here are some common commands:

    - If you installed Elasticsearch with Homebrew, use `brew services restart elasticsearch`.
    - If you installed Elasticsearch with `apt`, use `sudo service elasticsearch restart`.
    - If you installed Elasticsearch with `yum`, use `sudo service elasticsearch restart`.

After you restart Elasticsearch, the security features should be enabled and the warning should disappear.

Please note that enabling security features will require you to set up user authentication. You can follow the instructions in the [Elasticsearch documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.13/security-minimal-setup.html) to set up minimal security for Elasticsearch.

If you don't want to set up user authentication and you're okay with the security risks, you can ignore the warning. The warning is just a reminder from Elasticsearch that the security features are not enabled.
