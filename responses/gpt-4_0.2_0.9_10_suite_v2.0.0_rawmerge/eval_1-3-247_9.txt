The error message you're seeing is because Django is trying to reverse the URL for the 'profile' view with an empty string as the 'name' argument, but it can't find a URL pattern that matches this.

The line causing the error is in your `index.html` file:

```html
<a href="{% url 'profile' post.author.username %}">
    @{{post.author.username}}
</a>
```

This line is trying to generate a URL for the 'profile' view using the username of the author of the post. However, it seems that for at least one of your posts, the `author` field is `None`, so `post.author.username` is trying to access the `username` attribute of `None`, which results in an empty string. 

To fix this, you should ensure that every post has an author before trying to create a URL for the author's profile. You can do this by adding a check in your template:

```html
{% if post.author %}
    <a href="{% url 'profile' post.author.username %}">
        @{{post.author.username}}
    </a>
{% endif %}
```

This will only generate the link if the post has an author. If the post doesn't have an author, no link will be generated. 

Also, you should check why some of your posts don't have an author. If every post should have an author, you might want to make the `author` field on your `NewPost` model required by removing `null=True`.
