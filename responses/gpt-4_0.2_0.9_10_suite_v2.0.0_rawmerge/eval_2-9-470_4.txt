The error message indicates that the ffi gem is trying to load a shared library (`libffi.so.6`) that it can't find. This is likely because the upgrade to your OS included an upgrade to libffi, and the newer version of libffi is not backwards-compatible with the older one.

Here are the steps to fix this issue:

1. Uninstall the ffi gem:

    ```bash
    gem uninstall ffi
    ```

2. Reinstall the ffi gem:

    ```bash
    gem install ffi
    ```

This should solve your problem. If it doesn't, you may need to specify the path to the new libffi.so file when you install the ffi gem. You can do this with the `--with-ffi-dir` option:

```bash
gem install ffi -- --with-ffi-dir=/path/to/new/libffi
```

Replace `/path/to/new/libffi` with the actual path to the new libffi.so file.

If you don't know where the new libffi.so file is, you can find it with the `locate` command:

```bash
locate libffi.so
```

This will print out the paths to all files named `libffi.so` on your system. You're looking for a path that includes `libffi.so.7` (or whatever the new version number is).
