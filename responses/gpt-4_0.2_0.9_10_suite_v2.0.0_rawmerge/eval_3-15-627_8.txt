Creating a calendar input in VBA Excel can be done using a UserForm and a ComboBox. Here's a simple example:

1. First, create a new UserForm in VBA.

2. Add a ComboBox to the UserForm.

3. In the UserForm's code module, add the following code to populate the ComboBox with dates:

```vba
Private Sub UserForm_Initialize()
    Dim i As Integer
    For i = 1 To 31
        ComboBox1.AddItem Format(i, "00")
    Next i
End Sub
```

4. You can then use the ComboBox's value as a date in your code. For example:

```vba
Private Sub CommandButton1_Click()
    Dim selectedDate As Date
    selectedDate = DateValue(ComboBox1.Value & " " & Format(Date, "mmmm yyyy"))
    MsgBox selectedDate
End Sub
```

This will display a message box with the selected date when a CommandButton on the UserForm is clicked.

This is a very basic example and doesn't account for different month lengths or leap years. For a more robust solution, you might want to consider using a third-party date picker control, or using the built-in date picker in Excel, if available.
