Sure, you can't directly combine two mapped types like that. Instead, you should create two separate types and then use the `&` operator to combine them into a single type. Here's how you can do it:

```typescript
type FruitsAndColors = {
  [key in fruit]: number;
} & {
  [key in color]: boolean;
}
```

This will create a type `FruitsAndColors` where each fruit has a numeric value and each color has a boolean value.
