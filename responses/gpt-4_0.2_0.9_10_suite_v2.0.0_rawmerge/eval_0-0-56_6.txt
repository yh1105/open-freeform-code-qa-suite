The issue you're experiencing is likely due to the fact that Vite's server is binding to `localhost` (127.0.0.1) by default, which is not accessible from outside the Docker container. To make the Vite server accessible from outside the Docker container, you need to bind it to `0.0.0.0`.

You can do this by modifying your `vite.config.ts` file to include a `host` property in the `server` object:

```typescript
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import vue from '@vitejs/plugin-vue'

// https://vitejs.dev/config/
export default defineConfig({
    resolve: { alias: { '@': '/src' } },
    plugins: [vue()],
    server: {
        host: '0.0.0.0',
        port: 8080
    }
})
```

This configuration tells Vite to bind the server to all network interfaces, making it accessible from any IP address, including from outside the Docker container.

After making this change, you should be able to access your Vite server from your host machine at `localhost:8080`.
