Sure, the issue is that you're mocking the `API` class as an object, not as a class. Here's how you can revise your code to mock the class correctly:

```javascript
import API from 'utils/API';

jest.mock('utils/API', () => {
  return jest.fn().mockImplementation(() => {
    return {someMethod: () => {}};
  });
});
```

In this revised version, `jest.fn().mockImplementation()` is used to mock the `API` class. It returns a new instance of the mock function for each call, which is what you want when mocking a class.
