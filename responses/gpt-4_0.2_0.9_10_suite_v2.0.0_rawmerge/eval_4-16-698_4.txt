You can use the `source` command to reload your `.bash_profile` without closing and reopening your terminal. Here's how you do it:

```bash
source ~/.bash_profile
```

This command will read and execute commands from the filename argument in the current shell context. If you made changes to your `.bash_profile`, those changes will be applied to your current terminal session.

If you're using a different shell like zsh, you would source the `.zshrc` file instead:

```bash
source ~/.zshrc
```

Remember, you need to run these commands every time you make changes to your `.bash_profile` or `.zshrc` and want to see the effects immediately.
