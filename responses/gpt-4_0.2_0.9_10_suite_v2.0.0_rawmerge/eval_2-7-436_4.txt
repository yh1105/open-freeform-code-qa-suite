The error message you're seeing suggests that your current PHP version, PHP extensions, or Composer version are not compatible with Laravel 9.

Here are the steps you should take to resolve this issue:

1. **Check your PHP version**: Laravel 9 requires PHP 8.0 or higher. You can check your PHP version by running the following command in your terminal:

    ```bash
    php -v
    ```
    If your PHP version is lower than 8.0, you'll need to upgrade it.

2. **Check your PHP extensions**: Laravel 9 requires the following PHP extensions: BCMath, Ctype, Fileinfo, JSON, Mbstring, OpenSSL, PDO, Tokenizer, and XML. You can check your installed extensions by running:

    ```bash
    php -m
    ```
    If any of the required extensions are missing, you'll need to install them.

3. **Check your Composer version**: Make sure you're using the latest version of Composer. You can check your Composer version by running:

    ```bash
    composer --version
    ```
    If your Composer version is not up to date, you can update it by running:

    ```bash
    composer self-update
    ```

4. **Try to install Laravel again**: Once you've confirmed that your PHP version, PHP extensions, and Composer version meet Laravel's requirements, try to install Laravel again:

    ```bash
    composer create-project laravel/laravel blog "9.*"
    ```
