The error message indicates that the ffi gem is unable to find the libffi.so.6 shared library. This could be due to the upgrade of your Ubuntu version, which might have updated the libffi library to a newer version.

You can check the version of libffi installed on your system by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
find /usr -name 'libffi.so*'
```

This command will search for all files starting with 'libffi.so' in the /usr directory and print their paths. If you see 'libffi.so.7' (or a higher version) but not 'libffi.so.6', it means that your system has a newer version of libffi.

To fix the issue, you can create a symbolic link from the newer version to 'libffi.so.6'. For example, if you have 'libffi.so.7', you can run:

```bash
sudo ln -s /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libffi.so.7 /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libffi.so.6
```

This command creates a symbolic link named 'libffi.so.6' that points to 'libffi.so.7'. This way, when the ffi gem tries to load 'libffi.so.6', it will actually load 'libffi.so.7'.

After running this command, try running your Rails command again. If you still get the same error, it might be necessary to reinstall the ffi gem:

```bash
gem uninstall ffi
gem install ffi
```

These commands will uninstall and then reinstall the ffi gem, which should now be able to find the libffi shared library.
