You can use `TextButton`, `ElevatedButton`, and `OutlinedButton` that are not deprecated button themes.
You can change the `shape` property which is placed in the `style` property. 

Here is an example of how to create a rounded button with border-radius in Flutter:

```dart
ElevatedButton(
  style: ElevatedButton.styleFrom(
    shape: RoundedRectangleBorder(
      borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(20), // 20 is the radius value
    ),
  ),
  onPressed: () {},
  child: Text('Button'),
)
```

In this example, `ElevatedButton` is used, but you can replace it with `TextButton` or `OutlinedButton` as needed. The `shape` property is placed in the `style` property, and `shape` is set to `RoundedRectangleBorder` with a `borderRadius` of 20. You can adjust the radius value to get the desired roundness.
