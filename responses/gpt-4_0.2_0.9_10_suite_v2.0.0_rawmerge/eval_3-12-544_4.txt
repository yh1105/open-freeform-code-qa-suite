The error you're encountering is due to the fact that you're trying to use Flutter's plugin services before `runApp()` has been called. This is because Flutter's plugin services aren't available until `runApp()` has been called.

To fix this, you need to ensure that `runApp()` is called first, and then you can use the plugin services. You can use `WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized()` to make sure that you have an instance of the Widgets binding.

Here's how you can modify your code:

```dart
void main() async {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  final appDocsDir = await getApplicationDocumentsDirectory();
  Hive.init(appDocsDir.path);
  runApp(MyApp());
}
```

`WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized()` initializes the binding for the first time and allows you to use the plugin services.
