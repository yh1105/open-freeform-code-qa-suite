Font Awesome 5 has made some changes in the way it is used compared to Font Awesome 4. The `font-family` is no longer just "FontAwesome", it's now divided into different styles: "Font Awesome 5 Free", "Font Awesome 5 Brands", and "Font Awesome 5 Pro". The content codes have also changed for some icons.

For the free solid style, you can use "Font Awesome 5 Free" as `font-family` and you need to add `font-weight: 900;`. 

Here is how you can modify your CSS to work with Font Awesome 5:

```css
#mainNav .navbar-collapse .navbar-sidenav .nav-link-collapse:after {
  float: right;
  content: "\f107";
  font-family: "Font Awesome 5 Free";
  font-weight: 900;
}
```

Please note that the unicode `\f107` corresponds to the `fa-angle-down` icon in Font Awesome 4. In Font Awesome 5, the unicode for the `fa-angle-down` icon is the same, so you don't need to change the `content` property.

However, if you find that the icon is not displaying correctly, you may need to check the Font Awesome 5 documentation to find the correct unicode for the icon you want to use.
