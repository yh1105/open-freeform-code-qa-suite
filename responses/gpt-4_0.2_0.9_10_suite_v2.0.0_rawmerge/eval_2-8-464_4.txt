The error you're encountering is due to the fact that AWS Lambda expects a Linux binary, but you're supplying a Windows binary. When you run `go build main.go` on a Windows machine, it produces a Windows binary (`main.exe`). 

To solve this issue, you need to cross-compile your Go code for Linux. Here's how you can do it:

1. Open your terminal.
2. Navigate to your project directory.
3. Set the `GOOS` and `GOARCH` environment variables to `linux` and `amd64` respectively, and then build your Go code. 

Here's the command you should run:

```bash
SET GOOS=linux
SET GOARCH=amd64
go build -o main main.go
```

This will produce a Linux binary named `main`.

4. Now, zip this binary:

```bash
zip function.zip main
```

5. Upload `function.zip` to AWS Lambda.

Remember to set the handler name to `main` when you're creating your Lambda function.

After following these steps, your Lambda function should work as expected.
