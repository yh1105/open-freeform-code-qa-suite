Yes, you can modify the internal CSS of Firefox to change the spacing between menu items. Here's how you can do it:

1. Open your Firefox profile folder. You can do this by typing `about:support` in the address bar and then clicking on `Open Folder` in the `Profile Folder` row.

2. In your profile folder, create a new folder named `chrome` if it doesn't exist.

3. Inside the `chrome` folder, create a new file named `userChrome.css`. If the file already exists, you can just edit it.

4. Open `userChrome.css` with a text editor and paste the following code:

    ```css
    /* Reduce spacing on context menus */
    :root {
        --arrowpanel-menuitem-padding: 4px 8px !important;
    }
    ```

5. Save the file and restart Firefox.

This code will reduce the padding around menu items to 4px top and bottom, 8px left and right. You can adjust these values to your liking.

Note: Starting from Firefox 69, by default, Firefox does not load `userChrome.css` or `userContent.css`. To make Firefox load them, you need to change the `toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets` preference to `true`.

1. Type `about:config` in the address bar and press Enter.
2. Click the button that says `Accept the Risk and Continue`.
3. In the search box, type `toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets`.
4. If the value in the `Value` column is `false`, click the toggle button in the same row to change it to `true`.
5. Restart Firefox.
