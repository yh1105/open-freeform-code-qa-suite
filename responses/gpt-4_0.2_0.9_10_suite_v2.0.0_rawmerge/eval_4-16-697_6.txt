The issue is that `~/.bashrc` is not sourced when you run non-interactive shell sessions, which is the case when you run a Docker container. 

To solve this, you can source `~/.bashrc` in your `launch.sh` script before running `npm install` and `node index.js`. 

Here's how you can modify your `launch.sh`:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

source $HOME/.bashrc

cd /workspace/demo
npm install
node index.js
```

This will ensure that the `nvm` environment is set up correctly before running your Node.js application.
