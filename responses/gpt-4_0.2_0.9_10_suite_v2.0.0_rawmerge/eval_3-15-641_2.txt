It seems like you're trying to retrieve the local path of a file that is synced with OneDrive/SharePoint using Excel VBA. Unfortunately, Excel VBA doesn't provide a direct method to retrieve the local path of a file stored on OneDrive/SharePoint.

However, you can use a workaround to get the local path of the OneDrive folder. Here is a simple VBA function that returns the local path of the OneDrive folder:

```vba
Function GetOneDrivePath() As String
    GetOneDrivePath = Environ("OneDrive")
End Function
```

You can then use this function to construct the local path of your file. Note that this will only work if the file is located in the OneDrive folder and the user has set up OneDrive on their machine.

Regarding the creation of folders and files on SharePoint using VBA, you might need to use SharePoint's REST API or CSOM (Client Side Object Model). This is more complex and requires knowledge of HTTP requests and possibly some other programming language like JavaScript or C#.

As for the "Open File Location" button in Excel, it's not exposed to VBA and there's no built-in function to simulate its behavior. 

Remember that working with files on SharePoint/OneDrive using VBA can be tricky due to the syncing process. It's recommended to ensure that the files are fully synced before trying to access them with VBA.
