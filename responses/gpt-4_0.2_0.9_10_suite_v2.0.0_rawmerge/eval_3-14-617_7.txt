This error can be caused by a variety of issues, so here are a few potential solutions:

1. **Check your code signing settings**: Make sure you have the correct provisioning profiles selected for your target and that your certificates are valid.

2. **Check your script phases**: If you have any scripts running in your build phases, make sure they are all completing successfully. The error message suggests that there might be an issue with a script phase.

3. **Check your dependencies**: Make sure all your dependencies are installed correctly. You can try running `pod deintegrate` and then `pod install` to reinstall your pods.

4. **Clean your build folder**: Try cleaning your build folder by going to `Product > Clean Build Folder` in Xcode.

5. **Update Xcode**: If you're not already on the latest version of Xcode, try updating.

6. **Check your disk space**: Make sure you have enough disk space available. If your disk is almost full, it can cause build failures.

7. **Check for hidden characters**: Sometimes, hidden characters in the script can cause issues. Make sure to check the script for any hidden characters.

8. **Check the compatibility of the libraries**: Make sure that the libraries you are using are compatible with the version of Swift and Xcode you are using.

If none of these solutions work, the error message you're seeing is often accompanied by more detailed output that can help you diagnose the problem. Check the build log for more information.
