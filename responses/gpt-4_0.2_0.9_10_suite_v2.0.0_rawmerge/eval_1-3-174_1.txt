The error message `ImportError: DLL load failed while importing _psycopg: The operating system cannot run %1.` indicates that the psycopg2 library is having trouble finding the necessary PostgreSQL client libraries.

Here are a few things you can try:

1. **Install PostgreSQL client libraries**: If you don't have PostgreSQL installed on your machine, you might need to install it. You can download it from the official PostgreSQL website. After installing PostgreSQL, try running your Python script again.

2. **Use psycopg2-binary**: The `psycopg2-binary` package is a stand-alone package that includes its own PostgreSQL binary libraries. You can install it using pip:

    ```bash
    pip install psycopg2-binary
    ```

    Then, in your Python script, you can import `psycopg2` as usual.

3. **Check your PATH**: Make sure that the PostgreSQL bin directory is in your PATH. You can add it to the PATH in your current session with:

    ```bash
    set PATH=%PATH%;C:\path\to\your\postgresql\bin
    ```

    Replace `C:\path\to\your\postgresql\bin` with the actual path to your PostgreSQL bin directory. After setting the PATH, try running your Python script again.

4. **Reinstall psycopg2**: Sometimes, reinstalling the library can solve the problem. First, uninstall psycopg2:

    ```bash
    pip uninstall psycopg2
    ```

    Then, reinstall it:

    ```bash
    pip install psycopg2
    ```

    After reinstalling psycopg2, try running your Python script again.

Remember to replace `pip` with `conda` if you are managing your packages with Anaconda.
