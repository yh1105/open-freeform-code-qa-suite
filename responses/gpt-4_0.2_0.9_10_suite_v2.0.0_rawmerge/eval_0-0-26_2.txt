The ESLint error you're seeing is because you're using an anonymous function as a component in your render method. ESLint expects all components to have a `displayName` for debugging purposes. 

You can solve this issue by either disabling the ESLint rule for that line or by creating a named function. 

Here's how you can do it:

**Option 1: Disabling the ESLint rule for that line**

```jsx
const columns_payment_summary_table = [ 
    {
      title: FooConstants.LABEL_QUANTITY_SELECTED,
      dataIndex: 'group',
      key: 'group',
      render: text => (
        // eslint-disable-next-line react/display-name
        <span>{getCountForCountry(text)}</span>
      ),
    }
  ]
```

**Option 2: Creating a named function**

```jsx
const renderGroup = text => <span>{getCountForCountry(text)}</span>;
renderGroup.displayName = 'renderGroup';

const columns_payment_summary_table = [ 
    {
      title: FooConstants.LABEL_QUANTITY_SELECTED,
      dataIndex: 'group',
      key: 'group',
      render: renderGroup,
    }
  ]
```

In the second option, we created a named function `renderGroup` and assigned a `displayName` to it. Then we used this function in the `render` property. This way, ESLint can see the `displayName` and won't throw an error.
