The error message "could not resolve macro `$crate::format_args`" is coming from the Rust Analyzer, which is a language server protocol implementation for Rust. It's not an error from the Rust compiler itself. This error message means that the Rust Analyzer is having trouble resolving the macro `format_args!` which is used internally by the `assert_eq!` macro in your test.

This is likely a bug or limitation in the Rust Analyzer itself, not an issue with your code. If your code compiles and runs correctly, and `cargo check` and `cargo test` don't report any issues, then your code is likely fine.

As for how to fix it, there are a few things you could try:

1. **Update Rust Analyzer**: If you're using an older version of Rust Analyzer, updating to the latest version might fix the issue.

2. **Restart your editor**: Sometimes, language servers can get into a bad state, and restarting your editor can help.

3. **Disable and re-enable Rust Analyzer**: This can also help reset the state of the language server.

4. **Check your Rust Analyzer settings**: Make sure that Rust Analyzer is correctly configured for your project. For example, if you're using a workspace, make sure that Rust Analyzer is aware of all the crates in your workspace.

If none of these steps help, you might want to consider reporting the issue to the Rust Analyzer team. They might be able to provide further assistance or fix the issue in a future version of Rust Analyzer.
