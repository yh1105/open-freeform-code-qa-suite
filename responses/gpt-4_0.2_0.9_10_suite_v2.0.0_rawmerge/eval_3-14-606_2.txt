It seems like there's a misunderstanding here. iOS doesn't have a "Developer Mode" that you can enable or disable like Android. The alert you're seeing is likely related to the app being a developer or test build, not the iOS system itself.

If you're trying to install a developer or test build of an app on your iOS device, you'll need to do so through a method that provisions the app for your device. This is usually done through a service like TestFlight or directly via Xcode.

Here are the steps to install a test build via TestFlight:

1. Download and install the TestFlight app from the App Store on your iOS device.

2. The developer should provide you with a TestFlight invitation code or URL.

3. Open the invitation in your email or Messages app and tap on the invitation link.

4. This will open TestFlight, where you can redeem the invitation code if necessary, and install the test build of the app.

If you're a developer and you're trying to run your app on your device via Xcode, you'll need to do the following:

1. Connect your device to your Mac.

2. Open Xcode and select your device from the list of available devices.

3. You may need to register your device with your Apple Developer account if you haven't done so already. You can do this in the Devices and Simulators window in Xcode.

4. Once your device is selected, you can run your app on your device by clicking the Run button.

If you're still having trouble, the issue may be with the app itself or the way it was provisioned. You should contact the developer or check the app's documentation for more information.
