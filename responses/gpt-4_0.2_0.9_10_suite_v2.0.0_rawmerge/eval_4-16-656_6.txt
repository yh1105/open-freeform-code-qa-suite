The `Get-Service` cmdlet in PowerShell does not provide a way to get the detailed description of a service. However, you can use the `Get-WmiObject` cmdlet to retrieve the description of a service.

Here is an example:

```powershell
Get-WmiObject -Query "Select * From Win32_Service" | Select-Object Name, DisplayName, Description | Out-GridView
```

This command will get all services (`Win32_Service`) and select the `Name`, `DisplayName`, and `Description` properties of each service. The output will be displayed in a grid view.

Please note that the `Get-WmiObject` cmdlet may require administrative privileges to run successfully.
