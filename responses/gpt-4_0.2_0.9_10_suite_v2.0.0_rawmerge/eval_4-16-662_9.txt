You can use `jq` to minify JSON in a shell script. `jq` is a lightweight and flexible command-line JSON processor. If it's not installed, you can install it using a package manager like `apt` for Ubuntu, `brew` for MacOS, etc.

Here's how you can use `jq` to minify JSON:

```bash
echo '{
    "foo": "lorem",
    "bar": "ipsum"
}' | jq -c .
```

This will output:

```bash
{"foo":"lorem","bar":"ipsum"}
```

In the above command, `jq -c .` means "compact output" (`-c`) and "." is a filter that matches the entire input.

If you have a JSON file, you can use `jq` in the following way:

```bash
jq -c . file.json
```

This will print the minified JSON to the console. If you want to overwrite the original file with the minified JSON, you can redirect the output back to the file:

```bash
jq -c . file.json > tmp.json && mv tmp.json file.json
```
