The Docker build output is different on macOS compared to Linux. On macOS, Docker runs in a virtual machine, and the Docker client communicates with the Docker daemon running inside this VM. This can lead to differences in the output of certain commands.

The `--progress=plain` option is used to disable the build output being updated in-place, which is useful when the output is intended to be logged. However, it doesn't change the verbosity of the output.

If you want to see the full output of a command run during the Docker build, you can try a couple of things:

1. **Use the `RUN` command with `set -x`**: This will print out each command before it is executed. For example, you can change `RUN ls -la` to `RUN set -x && ls -la`.

2. **Use the `docker logs` command**: If you want to see the output of a running container, you can use the `docker logs` command. For example, `docker logs <container_id>`.

3. **Use the `-v` or `--verbose` option**: This option can increase the verbosity of the output. However, this option is not available for the `docker build` command.

4. **Check the Docker documentation**: The Docker documentation might have more information on how to increase the verbosity of the Docker build output on macOS.

Remember that the Docker build process on macOS might be different from Linux due to the use of a VM. This might affect the output of certain commands.
