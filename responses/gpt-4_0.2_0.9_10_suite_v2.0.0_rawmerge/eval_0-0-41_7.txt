Your code is almost correct. The `navigator.geolocation` check is for verifying if the geolocation feature is available in the browser, not if the user has given permission to access the location.

The `getCurrentPosition` method takes two callback functions as arguments. The first one is executed when the location is successfully retrieved, and the second one is executed when an error occurs. You can use this second callback to check if the user has denied the location permission.

Here is the corrected code:

```javascript
if (navigator.geolocation) {
    navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(
        position => {
            console.log("Location accessed");
        },
        error => {
            if (error.code == error.PERMISSION_DENIED)
                console.log("User not allowed");
        }
    );
} else {
    console.log("Geolocation is not supported by this browser.");
}
```

In this code, if the user denies the location permission, the "User not allowed" message will be logged. If the geolocation feature is not supported by the browser, the "Geolocation is not supported by this browser." message will be logged.
