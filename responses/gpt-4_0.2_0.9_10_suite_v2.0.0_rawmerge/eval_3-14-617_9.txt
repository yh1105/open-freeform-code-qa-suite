This error can occur due to a variety of reasons. Here are a few solutions you can try:

1. **Check your code signing settings:** Make sure you have the correct provisioning profiles selected for your target under "Build Settings" > "Signing" > "Code Signing Identity". Also, ensure that your provisioning profile is valid and not expired.

2. **Clean your project:** You can do this by going to "Product" > "Clean" in Xcode. Then, delete derived data again.

3. **Check your script:** If you have a script in the "Build Phases" > "Run Script", make sure it's not causing the error. You can comment out the script temporarily to see if it's the cause of the problem.

4. **Update your CocoaPods:** Sometimes, outdated pods can cause this issue. Try updating your pods by running `pod update` in the terminal.

5. **Check your podfile:** Make sure you're not using any deprecated or unsupported pods. Also, ensure that the versions of the pods you're using are compatible with your version of Swift and Xcode.

6. **Check your Swift version:** If you recently updated Xcode, your Swift version might have changed. Make sure your project and all your pods are compatible with your current Swift version.

7. **Check your disk space:** Make sure you have enough disk space. Xcode needs a lot of space to compile and archive projects.

If none of these solutions work, you might need to create a new project and move your files there. This is a last resort, as it can be time-consuming and you might lose some settings.
