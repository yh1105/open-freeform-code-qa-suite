The error message you're seeing indicates that the `/data` directory is on a read-only file system, so you can't create new directories in it. 

On macOS Catalina and later, the system disk is split into two volumes: one for system files and another for data files. The system volume is mounted as read-only to protect system files. This is why you're unable to create a directory at the root level.

Here are a few alternatives:

1. **Create the directory under your home directory**. This is the recommended approach for most use cases. You can create a new directory in your home directory like this:

```bash
mkdir ~/data/db
```

2. **Use the /Users/Shared directory**. If you need a location that's accessible to all users, you can use the `/Users/Shared` directory:

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /Users/Shared/data/db
```

3. **Disable the read-only file system**. This is not recommended because it can make your system vulnerable to attacks. However, if you really need to do this, you can follow these steps:

    - Restart your Mac and hold down Command + R to enter Recovery Mode.
    - From the Utilities menu, select Terminal.
    - In the Terminal, type `csrutil disable` and press Enter.
    - Restart your Mac.

After you've disabled the read-only file system, you should be able to create the directory. However, remember to re-enable the read-only file system by following the same steps and typing `csrutil enable` in the Terminal.
