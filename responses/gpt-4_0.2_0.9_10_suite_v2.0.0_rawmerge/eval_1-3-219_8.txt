Here are some steps you can try to solve your problem:

1. **Update your packages:** Make sure your Python, Jupyter, and IPyKernel packages are up-to-date. You can update them using the following commands:

```bash
conda activate da38
conda update python
conda update jupyter
conda update ipykernel
```

2. **Check your Python interpreter:** Make sure that the Python interpreter selected in VS Code is the one from your `da38` environment. You can check this by clicking on the Python version in the bottom left corner of the VS Code window.

3. **Check your Jupyter server settings:** In VS Code, go to `File > Preferences > Settings` and search for `Jupyter Server`. Make sure it's set to `local`.

4. **Try to start Jupyter manually:** Try to start a Jupyter notebook server manually from the command line and see if it works. You can do this with the following command:

```bash
conda activate da38
jupyter notebook
```

5. **Check your VS Code settings:** In VS Code, go to `File > Preferences > Settings` and search for `Jupyter`. Make sure the `Allow Unauthorized Remote Connection` option is unchecked.

6. **Reinstall the Python extension:** If none of the above steps work, try reinstalling the Python extension in VS Code.

If you're still having issues after trying these steps, please provide more information about your setup, such as the exact versions of Python, Jupyter, and IPyKernel you're using, and any error messages you're seeing in the VS Code output or terminal windows.
