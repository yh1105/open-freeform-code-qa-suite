The error message you're seeing is due to a change in the pandas library. The `join_axes` parameter was deprecated in pandas version 0.25.0 and removed in version 1.0.0. 

The pandas-profiling library you're using is likely not compatible with the version of pandas you have installed. 

You can try to solve this issue by downgrading your pandas version to 0.25.3 or by upgrading your pandas-profiling version. 

Here is how you can do it:

1. Downgrade pandas:

```bash
conda install pandas=0.25.3
```

2. Upgrade pandas-profiling:

```bash
pip install --upgrade pandas-profiling
```

If you still encounter the same issue after trying the above steps, you can also try to uninstall and reinstall pandas-profiling:

```bash
pip uninstall pandas-profiling
pip install pandas-profiling
```

Remember to restart your Jupyter notebook after installing or uninstalling any packages.
