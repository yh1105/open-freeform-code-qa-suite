The `EINTEGRITY` error is a checksum error that happens when the package's `shasum` in `npm` registry doesn't match the `shasum` calculated after download. This could be due to a variety of reasons such as network issues, npm cache corruption, or issues with the package itself.

Here are some steps you can take to resolve this issue:

1. **Clear the npm cache:**

    You can use the following command to clear the npm cache:

    ```bash
    npm cache clean --force
    ```

    This command will clear your npm cache, which might contain the corrupted package.

2. **Delete `node_modules` and `package-lock.json`:**

    If clearing the cache doesn't work, you can try deleting the `node_modules` directory and `package-lock.json` file, then run `npm install` again:

    ```bash
    rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
    npm install
    ```

    This will remove all installed packages and the lock file, and reinstall everything.

3. **Update npm:**

    If the issue persists, you might be using an outdated version of npm. You can update npm using the following command:

    ```bash
    npm install -g npm@latest
    ```

    This will install the latest version of npm globally.

4. **Check your network connection:**

    If you're still encountering the error, it might be due to a network issue. Try switching to a different network or using a VPN.

5. **Check the package:**

    If none of the above solutions work, the issue might be with the package itself. You can try installing a different version of the package, or contact the package maintainer for help.

Remember to always back up your project before making any changes to it.
