If the data in the line following "Cabinet No." is separated by a specific delimiter (like a comma, space, or tab), you can use the `Split` function in VBA to split the string into an array and then assign the array elements to the different columns. 

Assuming the data is separated by a space, you can modify your code as follows:

```vba
idx = InStr(textline, "Cabinet No.")
If idx > 0 Then
    Line Input #1, textline
    Line Input #1, textline
    Dim splitData() As String
    splitData = Split(textline, " ") 'replace " " with your delimiter
    ActiveSheet.Cells(nextrow, "G").Value = splitData(0)
    ActiveSheet.Cells(nextrow, "H").Value = splitData(1)
    ActiveSheet.Cells(nextrow, "I").Value = splitData(2)
    ActiveSheet.Cells(nextrow, "J").Value = splitData(3)
    ActiveSheet.Cells(nextrow, "K").Value = splitData(4)
    nextrow = nextrow + 1 'now move to next row
End If
```

Please replace `" "` in the `Split` function with your actual delimiter. Also, adjust the indices of `splitData` and column letters as per your requirement.
