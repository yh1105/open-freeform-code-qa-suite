You can achieve this by simply replacing the space character with an empty string. In your code, you are replacing all special characters with a space character. Instead, you can replace them with an empty string. Here is how you can do it:

```vba
Sub ReplaceSpecial()
    Dim cel As Range
    Dim strVal As String
    Dim i As Long
    Application.ScreenUpdating = False
    For Each cel In Selection
        strVal = cel.Value
        For i = 1 To Len(strVal)
            Select Case Asc(Mid(strVal, i, 1))
                Case 32, 48 To 57, 65 To 90, 97 To 122
                    ' Leave ordinary characters alone
                Case Else
                    Mid(strVal, i, 1) = ""
            End Select
        Next i
        cel.Value = strVal
    Next cel
    Application.ScreenUpdating = True
End Sub
```

Please note that this code will remove all special characters and spaces from the selected cells. If you want to keep the spaces between words, you should not include 32 (ASCII value for space) in the Case statement.
