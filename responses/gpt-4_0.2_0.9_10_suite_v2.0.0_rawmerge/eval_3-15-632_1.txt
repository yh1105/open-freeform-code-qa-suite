If you want to split a line into multiple columns, you can use the `Split` function in VBA. This function splits a string into a one-dimensional array based on a delimiter. In your case, if you want to split the line into 5 columns, you need to know the delimiter. Let's assume the delimiter is a space (" ").

Here is how you can modify your code:

```vba
idx = InStr(textline, "Cabinet No.")
If idx > 0 Then
    Line Input #1, textline
    Line Input #1, textline
    Dim splitText As Variant
    splitText = Split(textline, " ") 'Assuming space is the delimiter
    ActiveSheet.Cells(nextrow, "G").Value = splitText(0)
    ActiveSheet.Cells(nextrow, "H").Value = splitText(1)
    ActiveSheet.Cells(nextrow, "I").Value = splitText(2)
    ActiveSheet.Cells(nextrow, "J").Value = splitText(3)
    ActiveSheet.Cells(nextrow, "K").Value = splitText(4)
    nextrow = nextrow + 1 'now move to next row
End If
```

This code will split the `textline` into 5 parts and put them into columns G, H, I, J, and K. Please adjust the indices of `splitText` and the column letters according to your needs. Also, make sure that your textline has at least 5 parts when split, otherwise you will get an error.
