You can use Python's multiprocessing module to run these two tasks concurrently. Here's how you can modify your code:

```python
import multiprocessing
from dash import Dash
import db
import hp
import fd
import dbc

def run_dash():
    app = Dash(__name__, external_stylesheets=[dbc.themes.BOOTSTRAP])
    database=db.dataBase()
    homepage=hp.homepage(database)
    homepage.timeUpdateCallback(app)
    homepage.gaugeRefreshCallback(app)
    app.layout = homepage.layoutMaker()
    app.run_server(debug=True)

def run_data_mining():
    database=db.dataBase()
    dataMiningScript= fd.financeData(database,1600)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Create processes
    p1 = multiprocessing.Process(target=run_dash)
    p2 = multiprocessing.Process(target=run_data_mining)

    # Start processes
    p1.start()
    p2.start()

    # Join processes
    p1.join()
    p2.join()
```

In this code, we define two functions, `run_dash` and `run_data_mining`, which contain the code for running the Dash server and the data mining script respectively. We then create two processes, `p1` and `p2`, which run these functions. The `start` method starts the processes, and the `join` method waits for them to finish.

Please note that the `multiprocessing` module spins off separate processes, each with its own Python interpreter. So, if your `financeData` function and Dash callbacks need to share data, you'll need to use a multiprocessing-safe data structure, like a `multiprocessing.Queue` or `multiprocessing.Manager`.

Also, be aware that the `multiprocessing` module behaves differently on different platforms. The above code should work on Unix/Linux. If you're on Windows, you'll need to ensure that your script can be safely imported (i.e., it doesn't immediately start executing code when it's imported).
