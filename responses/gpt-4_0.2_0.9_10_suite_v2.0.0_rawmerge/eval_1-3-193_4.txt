The error message indicates that Selenium can't find the Firefox binary in its default location. This could be due to several reasons:

1. Firefox is not installed on your machine.
2. Firefox is installed but not in the default location.
3. The PATH environment variable does not include the Firefox binary location.

Here are some solutions:

1. **Install Firefox**: If Firefox is not installed on your machine, you should install it.

2. **Specify the Firefox Binary Location**: If Firefox is installed but not in the default location, you can specify the binary location in your code. Here's how you can do it:

```python
from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.firefox.service import Service
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By
from selenium.webdriver.firefox.options import Options as FirefoxOptions
from selenium.webdriver.firefox.firefox_binary import FirefoxBinary

binary = FirefoxBinary('path/to/your/firefox/binary')
driver = webdriver.Firefox(firefox_binary=binary)
driver.get('http://www.seleniumhq.org')
```

Replace `'path/to/your/firefox/binary'` with the actual path to your Firefox binary.

3. **Update the PATH Environment Variable**: If the PATH environment variable does not include the Firefox binary location, you can add it. The process to do this varies depending on your operating system.

For Windows:

- Right-click on 'My Computer' and select 'Properties'.
- Navigate to 'Advanced System Settings' > 'Environment Variables'.
- Under 'System Variables', find the 'Path' variable, select it, and click on 'Edit'.
- In the 'Variable value' field, append the path to your Firefox binary, preceded by a semicolon (;). For example, if your Firefox binary is located at `C:\Program Files\Mozilla Firefox\firefox.exe`, you would append `;C:\Program Files\Mozilla Firefox\` to the 'Variable value' field.
- Click 'OK' to close all dialog boxes.

For Linux/Mac:

- Open a terminal.
- If you use bash (which is the default shell in most cases), edit `~/.bashrc` (or `~/.bash_profile` on a Mac) with a text editor of your choice (e.g., `nano ~/.bashrc`).
- Add the following line to the file, replacing `/path/to/your/firefox/binary` with the actual path to your Firefox binary: `export PATH=$
