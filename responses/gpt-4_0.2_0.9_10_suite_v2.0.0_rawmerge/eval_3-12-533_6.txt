The `GestureDetector` widget in Flutter provides the ability to detect simple gestures on a widget. However, it only works on the area occupied by its child. If the child does not provide a specific size, the `GestureDetector` will not work as expected.

In your case, the `GestureDetector` is only wrapping the `QQBody` widget, which only contains a `Text` widget. Therefore, the tap is only detected when you tap on the `Text` widget.

To make the `GestureDetector` work for the whole screen, you need to make sure it covers the whole screen. You can do this by wrapping your `GestureDetector` with an `Expanded` or `Container` widget and give it a size.

Here is an example:

```dart
class QQHome extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      debugShowCheckedModeBanner: false,
      theme: ThemeData(
        primaryColor: Colors.blueGrey,
      ),
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          centerTitle: true,
          title: Text('QuoteQuota'),
        ),
        body: Container(
          width: double.infinity,
          height: double.infinity,
          child: GestureDetector(
            onTap: () => print('Tapped'),
            child: QQBody(),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class QQBody extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Center(
      child: Text(
        'Hello, World!'
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this code, the `Container` widget with `width: double.infinity` and `height: double.infinity` will take up the whole screen, and the `GestureDetector` will detect taps anywhere on the screen.
