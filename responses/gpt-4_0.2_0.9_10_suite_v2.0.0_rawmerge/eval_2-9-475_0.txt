It seems like you're missing the `libffi` library, which is a dependency for the `travis-cli` gem. You can install it using Homebrew.

Here are the steps:

1. If you don't have Homebrew installed, install it first:

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

2. Install `libffi`:

```bash
brew install libffi
```

3. After installing `libffi`, you need to set the `PKG_CONFIG_PATH` environment variable to point to the `libffi` pkgconfig file. This is because the `ffi` gem needs this to find the `libffi` library.

```bash
export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/usr/local/opt/libffi/lib/pkgconfig"
```

4. Now, you should be able to install the `travis-cli` gem:

```bash
gem install travis
```

Remember, you may need to add the `export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/usr/local/opt/libffi/lib/pkgconfig"` line to your shell profile file (like `~/.bashrc`, `~/.bash_profile`, or `~/.zshrc`) to make sure this environment variable is set every time you open a new terminal window.
