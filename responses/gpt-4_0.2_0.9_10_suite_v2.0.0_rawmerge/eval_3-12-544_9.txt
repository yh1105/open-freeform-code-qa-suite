The error you're seeing is because you're trying to use an asynchronous function (`getApplicationDocumentsDirectory()`) in the `main()` function, which is not asynchronous by default. 

To fix this, you need to make your `main()` function asynchronous and ensure that Flutter has finished its setup before you try to access the file system. 

You can do this by calling `WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized()` before calling any asynchronous functions. Here's how you can modify your code:

```dart
void main() async {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  final appDocsDir = await getApplicationDocumentsDirectory();
  Hive.init(appDocsDir.path);
  runApp(MyApp());
}
```

`WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized()` is required to call before any asynchronous tasks in `main()`. It initializes essential platform-specific parts and schedules a callback for the end of this frame to initialize the rest, which includes binding the system channels, ensuring the necessary platform services are started, and so on.
