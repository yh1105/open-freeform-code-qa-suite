You can use the `border-t` class to apply border only to the top. Remove the `border` class which applies the border to all sides. Here is how you can do it:

```html
<div class="border-t border-blue-900">foo</div>
```

This will apply a border only to the top of your `div` and the border color will be `blue-900`.
