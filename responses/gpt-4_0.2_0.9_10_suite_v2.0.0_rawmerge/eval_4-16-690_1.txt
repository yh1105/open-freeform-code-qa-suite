The issue you're experiencing may be due to the fact that macOS Catalina 10.15 switched the default shell from Bash to Zsh. 

If you're using the default shell (Zsh), it won't source `~/.bash_profile` or `~/.profile`. Instead, Zsh uses `~/.zshrc` and `~/.zprofile`.

To set the environment variable for Zsh, you can add the export line to `~/.zshrc` or `~/.zprofile`:

```bash
echo 'export JBOSS_HOME=/Users/{USERNAME}/Desktop/jboss7' >> ~/.zshrc
```

Then, source the file:

```bash
source ~/.zshrc
```

Now, if you execute `echo $JBOSS_HOME`, it should display the correct path.

If you want to continue using Bash instead of Zsh, you can change your default shell back to Bash by using the following command:

```bash
chsh -s /bin/bash
```

Then, add the export line to your `~/.bash_profile`:

```bash
echo 'export JBOSS_HOME=/Users/{USERNAME}/Desktop/jboss7' >> ~/.bash_profile
```

And source the file:

```bash
source ~/.bash_profile
```

Now, `echo $JBOSS_HOME` should work as expected.
