The `rename` function is used to rename the DataFrame's index or columns directly, not the Series. In your case, the `groupby` operation returns a Series, not a DataFrame. So, you should convert it to DataFrame first and then rename the column. Here is the function you asked for:

```python
def renameDataFrame(df):
    avg = df.groupby(["t"], sort=False)["p"].mean().reset_index()
    avg.rename(columns = {"p":"mean"}, inplace=True)
    return avg
```

In this function, `reset_index` is used to convert the Series to DataFrame and then `rename` is used to rename the column. The `inplace=True` argument is used to make the changes in the DataFrame itself, without returning a new DataFrame.
