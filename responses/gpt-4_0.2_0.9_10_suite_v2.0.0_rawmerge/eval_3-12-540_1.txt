Yes, in Flutter, you can draw vertical lines between components using the `VerticalDivider` widget. This widget creates a material design vertical divider.

Here is an example of how you can use it:

```dart
Row(
  children: <Widget>[
    Expanded(
      child: Text('Component 1'),
    ),
    const VerticalDivider(
      color: Colors.grey,
      thickness: 1,
      width: 20,
    ),
    Expanded(
      child: Text('Component 2'),
    ),
  ],
)
```

In this example, a vertical line (divider) is drawn between two text components. You can customize the color, thickness, and width of the divider according to your needs.

Please note that `VerticalDivider` is a material design widget, so it should be used inside a `Material` widget. If you are not already inside a `Material` widget, you can use `Card`, `Dialog`, `Drawer`, `Scaffold`, etc., which are all `Material` widgets.
