Sure, here is the code snippet with the blanks filled:

```rust
    let ix = anchor_lang::solana_program::system_instruction::transfer(
        from_pubkey, // The account from which SOL will be transferred
        to_pubkey, // The account to which SOL will be transferred
        amount, // The amount of SOL to be transferred
    );
    anchor_lang::solana_program::program::invoke(
        &ix,
        &[
            from_account_info, // The account info of the account from which SOL will be transferred
            to_account_info, // The account info of the account to which SOL will be transferred
        ],
    );
```
In this code snippet, `from_pubkey` and `to_pubkey` are the public keys of the accounts involved in the transfer. `from_account_info` and `to_account_info` are the corresponding account info objects. `amount` is the amount of SOL to be transferred.
