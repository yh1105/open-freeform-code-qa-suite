Sure, here is a bash script that you can use to install a specific version of Python using Homebrew:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Uninstall existing Python
brew uninstall --ignore-dependencies python

# Install Python 3.6.5
brew install python@3.6

# Link Python 3.6.5
brew link --force python@3.6
```

Please note that this script will uninstall the existing Python version before installing Python 3.6.5. Also, the `--force` flag is used to force the linking of Python 3.6.5, which might not be necessary in all cases.
