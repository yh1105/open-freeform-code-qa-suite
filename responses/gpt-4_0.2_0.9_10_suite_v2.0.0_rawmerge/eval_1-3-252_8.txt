You can use the `groupby` method of pandas DataFrame to group the data by column 'A', and then use the `idxmin` method to find the index of the minimum value in column 'B' for each group. After that, use the `loc` method to select these rows. Here is the function:

```python
def getMin(df):
    return df.loc[df.groupby('A')['B'].idxmin()]
```

This function works as follows:

1. `df.groupby('A')['B'].idxmin()` groups the DataFrame by column 'A', and for each group, it finds the index of the row with the minimum value in column 'B'.
2. `df.loc[...]` selects the rows with these indices from the DataFrame.

So, if you apply this function to your DataFrame, it will return the rows with the minimum 'B' value for each 'A' value.
