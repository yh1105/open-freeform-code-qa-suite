Your code seems fine, but the issue might be that you're trying to test the `@Binding` in the `PreviewProvider`. The `PreviewProvider` doesn't support live updates, so you won't see changes there when you toggle `isSelected`.

To see the changes, you need to use your `ContentView` in a parent view that has a `@State` property and passes its binding to `ContentView`. Here's an example:

```swift
struct ParentView: View {
    @State private var isSelected: Bool = false

    var body: some View {
        ContentView(isSelected: $isSelected)
    }
}
```

In this example, `ParentView` has a `@State` property `isSelected` and it passes the binding to `ContentView`. When you run your app and click the button in `ContentView`, you should see the text change.
