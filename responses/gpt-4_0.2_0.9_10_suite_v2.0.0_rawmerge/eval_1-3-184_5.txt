Here is a Python function that uses `openpyxl` to open an Excel file, search for a specific string in all cells, and return the indexes of the rows that contain that string.

```python
from openpyxl import load_workbook

def filterExcelRows(filePath, matchedString):
    # Load the workbook and select the first sheet
    wb = load_workbook(filename=filePath)
    sheet = wb.active

    # List to store the indexes of the rows that contain the matched string
    matched_rows = []

    # Iterate over all the rows in the sheet
    for row in sheet.iter_rows():
        # Iterate over all cells in the row
        for cell in row:
            # If the cell contains the matched string, add the row index to the list
            if cell.value is not None and matchedString in str(cell.value):
                matched_rows.append(cell.row)
                break  # No need to check the rest of the cells in this row

    return matched_rows
```

This function will return a list of row indexes. If the string is not found in any cell, it will return an empty list. Note that `openpyxl` uses 1-based indexing for rows and columns, so the first row is row 1, not row 0.
