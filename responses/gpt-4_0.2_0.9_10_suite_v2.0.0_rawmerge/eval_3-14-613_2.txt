This issue might be due to the SwiftUI Preview not being associated with a target. Here are some steps to fix this:

1. Select the SwiftUI file in the Project Navigator.
2. In the File Inspector (the first tab in the right panel), under the "Target Membership" section, make sure your app's target is checked.
3. Clean the build folder (Product > Clean Build Folder).
4. Quit and restart Xcode.

If the issue persists, try creating a new SwiftUI file and check if the preview works there. If it does, you can move your code to the new file.
