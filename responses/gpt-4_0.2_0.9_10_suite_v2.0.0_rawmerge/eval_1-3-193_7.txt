The error message you're seeing is because Selenium can't find the Firefox binary in its default location. This could be because Firefox is not installed, or it's installed in a non-default location.

Here are a few things you can try:

1. **Check if Firefox is installed**: Selenium requires the Firefox browser to be installed on your machine. If it's not, you can download it from the [official Firefox website](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/).

2. **Specify the Firefox binary location manually**: If Firefox is installed but not in its default location, you can specify the path to the Firefox binary manually. Here's how you can do it:

```python
from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.firefox.service import Service
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By
from selenium.webdriver.firefox.options import Options as FirefoxOptions

options = FirefoxOptions()
options.binary_location = "/path/to/your/firefox/binary"
driver = webdriver.Firefox(service=Service("/path/to/your/geckodriver"), options=options)
driver.get("http://www.seleniumhq.org")
```

Replace `"/path/to/your/firefox/binary"` with the actual path to your Firefox binary, and `"/path/to/your/geckodriver"` with the path to your Geckodriver.

3. **Check your Geckodriver**: Selenium uses a driver to interface with the chosen browser. Firefox requires Geckodriver, which needs to be installed before running your script. You can download it from the [official GitHub repository](https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases). After downloading, extract it and add it to your system's PATH, or provide the path to the service as shown in the code above.

Remember to replace the paths in the code with the actual paths on your machine.
