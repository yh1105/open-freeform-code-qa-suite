The warning is due to Dart's null safety feature. The `Map` operator `[]` returns a nullable type because it could potentially return `null` if the key doesn't exist in the map. 

To solve the warning, you can either:

1. Use the `!` operator to tell Dart that you're sure the value won't be `null`:

```dart
void foo(Map<int, String> myMap) {
  if (myMap.containsKey(1)) {
    String s = myMap[1]!;
  }
}
```

2. Or, you can change the type of `s` to `String?`:

```dart
void foo(Map<int, String> myMap) {
  if (myMap.containsKey(1)) {
    String? s = myMap[1];
  }
}
```

The first option is better if you're sure that the key will always exist in the map when you're accessing it. The second option is better if there's a chance the key might not exist, and you want to handle that case explicitly.
