The error message is indicating that Doctrine cannot find the migration class you're trying to execute. The problem might be due to the wrong namespace or incorrect migration version number.

Based on your configuration and the migration class name, you should be able to execute the migration using the following command:

```bash
bin/console --env=dev doctrine:migrations:execute 'Application\Migrations\Version20210909072642' --down --no-interaction -vvv
```

This command includes the full namespace of the migration class (`Application\Migrations\Version20210909072642`), which should match the namespace declared in the migration file.

If the problem persists, make sure that the migration file `Version20210909072642.php` exists in the `app/DoctrineMigrations` directory and its class is correctly namespaced.
