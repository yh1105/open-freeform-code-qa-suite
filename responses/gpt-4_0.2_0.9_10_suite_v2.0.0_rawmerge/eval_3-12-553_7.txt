The error message you're seeing indicates that your Flutter project isn't using AndroidX, which is the open-source project used by the Android team to develop, test, package, version and release libraries within Jetpack. AndroidX is a major improvement to the original Android Support Library and all new Android projects are using AndroidX.

To fix this issue, you need to migrate your project to AndroidX. Here are the steps to do so:

1. Backup your project.
2. Open your project's `android/gradle.properties` file.
3. Add the following lines:

    ```markdown
    android.useAndroidX=true
    android.enableJetifier=true
    ```

4. Update your `compileSdkVersion` to `28` in your `android/app/build.gradle` file.

5. Change your app dependencies to the AndroidX equivalents. For example, if you're using `compile 'com.android.support:appcompat-v7:28.0.0'`, you should change it to `implementation 'androidx.appcompat:appcompat:1.1.0'`.

6. Run `flutter clean` in your terminal to clean your project's build.

7. Finally, run `flutter run` to see if the issue is resolved.

If you're still facing issues, you might need to manually migrate your project to AndroidX. You can follow the steps provided in the [official Flutter documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/androidx-migration) to do so.

After migrating to AndroidX, you should be able to generate your Android project and its APK without any issues.
