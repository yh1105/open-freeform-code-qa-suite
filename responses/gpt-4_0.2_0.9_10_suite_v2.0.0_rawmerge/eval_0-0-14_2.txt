Sure, you need to wrap the `Switch` component and the `span` inside a `div` or any other container. Here is the revised version of your code:

```jsx
<Form.Item name="switch" valuePropName="checked">
  <div>
    <Switch checkedChildren="Yes" unCheckedChildren="No" />
    <span>Chargable</span>
  </div>
</Form.Item>
```

This way, the `Switch` component and the `span` will be treated as a single unit, and the `Switch` value will be correctly passed to the `onCreate` function.
