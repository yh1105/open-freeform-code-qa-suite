The warning you're seeing is because Elasticsearch 7.13.1 has built-in security features that are not enabled by default. This means that without authentication, your Elasticsearch cluster could be accessible to anyone.

To fix this, you need to enable Elasticsearch's built-in security features. Here's how you can do it:

1. Open the `elasticsearch.yml` configuration file in a text editor. You can typically find this file in the `/etc/elasticsearch` or `/usr/local/etc/elasticsearch` directory.

2. Add the following lines to the file:

    ```yml
    xpack.security.enabled: true
    xpack.security.transport.ssl.enabled: true
    ```

3. Save your changes and close the file.

4. Restart Elasticsearch to apply the changes. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:

    ```bash
    brew services restart elasticsearch
    ```

5. After restarting Elasticsearch, you need to set up passwords for the built-in user accounts. Run the following command in your terminal:

    ```bash
    bin/elasticsearch-setup-passwords interactive
    ```

6. Follow the prompts to set passwords for the built-in user accounts.

7. Update your application's Elasticsearch configuration to use the new passwords. You can do this by adding the following lines to your `config/elasticsearch.yml` file:

    ```yml
    searchkick:
      username: "elastic"
      password: "your_password"
    ```

8. Save your changes and restart your Rails application.

Please note that the exact paths and commands may vary depending on your specific setup. If you installed Elasticsearch with Homebrew, the `elasticsearch.yml` file is typically located in the `/usr/local/etc/elasticsearch` directory and you can restart Elasticsearch with the `brew services restart elasticsearch` command. If you installed Elasticsearch manually, the `elasticsearch.yml` file is typically located in the `/etc/elasticsearch` directory and you can restart Elasticsearch with the `systemctl restart elasticsearch` command.
