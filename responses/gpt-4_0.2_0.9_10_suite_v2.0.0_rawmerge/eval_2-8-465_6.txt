The `ext-zip` is a PHP extension for handling zip archives. It's not a Composer package, so you can't install it using Composer. 

The error message you're seeing is because Composer is trying to find a package named `ext-zip` and it can't, because `ext-zip` is a PHP extension, not a package.

To install `ext-zip`, you need to install it as a PHP extension. The process for doing this depends on your operating system.

**For Ubuntu/Debian:**

You can install it using `apt-get`:

```bash
sudo apt-get install php-zip
```

**For CentOS/RHEL:**

You can install it using `yum`:

```bash
sudo yum install php-pecl-zip
```

**For Windows:**

You can enable it in your `php.ini` file by uncommenting or adding the line:

```ini
extension=php_zip.dll
```

After installing the extension, you may need to restart your web server for the changes to take effect.

If you're using PHPStorm, you might also need to configure it to use the PHP interpreter that has the `ext-zip` extension installed. You can do this in the PHPStorm settings under `Languages & Frameworks > PHP`.
