The `Get-Service` cmdlet in PowerShell doesn't provide a way to get the detailed description of a service. However, you can use the `Get-WmiObject` cmdlet to get the description of a service. Here is an example:

```powershell
Get-WmiObject -Query "Select * From Win32_Service" | Select-Object Name, Description | Out-GridView
```

This command will get all the services on your system and select the `Name` and `Description` properties of each service. The output will be displayed in a grid view.

If you want to get the description of a specific service, you can filter the services by name. Here is an example:

```powershell
Get-WmiObject -Query "Select * From Win32_Service Where Name = 'wuauserv'" | Select-Object Name, Description
```

This command will get the service with the name 'wuauserv' and select the `Name` and `Description` properties. The output will be displayed in the console.
