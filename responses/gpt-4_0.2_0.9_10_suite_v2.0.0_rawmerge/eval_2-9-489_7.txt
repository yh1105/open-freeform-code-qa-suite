The warning message you're seeing is because Elasticsearch 7.13.1 has built-in security features that are not currently enabled in your setup. This could potentially leave your Elasticsearch cluster accessible to anyone.

To fix this, you need to enable the built-in security features of Elasticsearch. Here are the steps to do this:

1. Open your Elasticsearch configuration file (`elasticsearch.yml`). The location of this file can vary depending on your installation. On macOS, it's typically located in `/usr/local/etc/elasticsearch` if you installed Elasticsearch with Homebrew.

2. Add the following lines to the `elasticsearch.yml` file:

    ```yaml
    xpack.security.enabled: true
    xpack.security.transport.ssl.enabled: true
    ```

3. Save the file and restart Elasticsearch.

Please note that enabling security will require all users to authenticate. You will need to create users and assign roles to them. You can do this using the built-in `elasticsearch-setup-passwords` tool.

Here's how you can use this tool:

1. Run the following command in your terminal:

    ```bash
    ./bin/elasticsearch-setup-passwords interactive
    ```

2. You will be prompted to enter passwords for various built-in users, such as `elastic`, `apm_system`, `kibana`, `logstash_system`, `beats_system`, and `remote_monitoring_user`.

After you've done this, you should be able to connect to Elasticsearch using these credentials.

Please note that you will also need to update your application's Elasticsearch client configuration to include these credentials when connecting to Elasticsearch.

For example, if you're using the `elasticsearch` Ruby gem, you can configure it like this:

```ruby
Elasticsearch::Client.new(
  url: 'http://localhost:9200',
  user: 'elastic',
  password: 'yourpassword',
  log: true
)
```

Replace `'elastic'` and `'yourpassword'` with the actual username and password you set up.

Remember to keep your credentials secure and avoid hardcoding them directly into your application. Consider using environment variables or a secure credential storage solution.
