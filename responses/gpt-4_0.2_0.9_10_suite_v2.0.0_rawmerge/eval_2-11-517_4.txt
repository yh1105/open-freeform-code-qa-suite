In C++, string interpolation is not as straightforward as in C# or JavaScript. However, you can achieve something similar using `std::ostringstream` or `sprintf` (though `sprintf` is more prone to errors and less recommended). Here is an example using `std::ostringstream`:

```cpp
#include <sstream>
#include <string>

int main() {
    int myVariable = 5;
    std::ostringstream oss;
    oss << "My variable has value " << myVariable;
    std::string result = oss.str();
    // result now contains "My variable has value 5"
}
```

In C++20, a new feature called "format library" was introduced, which allows a more Python-like string formatting:

```cpp
#include <format> // for C++20

int main() {
    int myVariable = 5;
    std::string result = std::format("My variable has value {}", myVariable);
    // result now contains "My variable has value 5"
}
```

Please note that the `std::format` function is part of C++20, and may not be available in all compilers yet.
