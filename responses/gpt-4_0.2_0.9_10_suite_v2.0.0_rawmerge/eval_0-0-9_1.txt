The `req.logout()` function is provided by Passport.js and is used to log out a user. This function does not require a callback function and does not return an error. The error you're seeing might be due to some other part of your code.

However, it's important to note that `req.logout()` only removes the `req.user` property and clears the login session (if any). If you're using persistent login sessions, `req.logout()` will not clear the session cookie. You need to do it manually.

Here's how you can modify your logout route to clear the session cookie:

```javascript
app.get("/logout", (req, res) => {
    req.logout();
    req.session.destroy(function (err) {
        if (err) {
            // handle error
        }
        res.clearCookie('connect.sid');
        // the redirect can be wherever you want it to be
        res.redirect('/');
    });
});
```

In this code, `req.session.destroy()` is used to destroy the session, and `res.clearCookie('connect.sid')` is used to clear the session cookie. After that, the user is redirected to the home page. 

Please replace `'connect.sid'` with the name of your session cookie if it's different. You can find this name in your browser's developer tools under the "Application" tab.
