The `EINTEGRITY` error is usually caused by a corruption in your npm cache. Here are some steps you can take to resolve this issue:

1. **Clear the npm cache**: Run the command `npm cache clean --force`. This will forcefully clear the npm cache.

2. **Delete `node_modules`**: Remove the `node_modules` directory in your project folder. You can do this by running `rm -rf node_modules`.

3. **Delete `package-lock.json`**: Remove the `package-lock.json` file in your project folder. You can do this by running `rm package-lock.json`.

4. **Reinstall the packages**: Run `npm install` again. This will fetch all the packages again and should resolve the integrity error.

If the error still persists, you can try the following:

5. **Update npm**: Sometimes, the error can be caused by bugs in your current version of npm. You can update npm by running `npm install -g npm@latest`.

6. **Check your network connection**: If you're on a flaky network connection, npm might not be able to download all package data, leading to integrity errors. If possible, try switching to a more stable network connection.

7. **Use a different package registry**: If the error still persists, it might be an issue with the npm registry. You can switch to a different registry, such as Yarn, by running `npm install -g yarn` and then `yarn install`.

Remember to always backup your project before making these changes.
