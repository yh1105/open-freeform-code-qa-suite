The issue you're facing could be due to a variety of reasons. Here are some steps you can follow to debug and potentially solve the problem:

1. **Check your `package.json` scripts**: Make sure your `package.json` has the correct scripts for building and starting your application. It should look something like this:

    ```json
    "scripts": {
        "dev": "next dev",
        "build": "next build",
        "start": "next start"
    }
    ```

2. **Check your dynamic routes**: If you're using dynamic routes, make sure you're using the file-based routing system correctly. For example, a file named `pages/posts/[id].js` will match `/posts/1`, `/posts/abc`, etc. But it won't match `/posts`.

3. **Check your `getStaticPaths` and `getStaticProps` (if you're using them)**: If you're using `getStaticPaths`, make sure you're returning all necessary paths. If you're using `getStaticProps`, make sure you're returning the correct props.

4. **Check your custom server (if you're using one)**: If you're using a custom server, make sure it's set up correctly. Remember that Vercel is designed to work best with Next.js's built-in server, so if you're using a custom one, you might run into issues.

5. **Check your Vercel settings**: Make sure you've set up your Vercel project correctly. You should select "Next.js" as your framework preset. Also, make sure your Build Command is `yarn run build` or `npm run build` and your Output Directory is `.next`.

6. **Check your Vercel logs**: If none of the above steps help, check your Vercel deployment logs. They should give you more information about what's going wrong.

If you're still having trouble, please provide more information about your application structure and any error messages you're seeing.
