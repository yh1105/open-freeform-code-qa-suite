You can use the `iter()` method in combination with the `min()` method to get the minimum value in a vector in Rust. Here is how you can do it:

```rust
let v = vec![5, 6, 8, 4, 2, 7];
let min = v.iter().min();

match min {
    Some(min) => println!("The minimum value is {}", min),
    None => println!("The vector is empty"),
}
```

In this code, `v.iter().min()` returns an `Option<&i32>`. If the vector is empty, `min()` will return `None`. If the vector is not empty, `min()` will return `Some(&i32)`, where `&i32` is a reference to the smallest `i32` in the vector.

The `match` statement is used to handle the `Option<&i32>`. If `min()` returned `Some(&i32)`, the code will print "The minimum value is " followed by the smallest `i32`. If `min()` returned `None`, the code will print "The vector is empty".
