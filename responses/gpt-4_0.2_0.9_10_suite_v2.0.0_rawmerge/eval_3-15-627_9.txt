Here's a simple way to create a calendar input in VBA Excel using a form and Microsoft's MonthView control:

1. First, you need to add a UserForm to your VBA project. To do this, in the VBA editor, click on "Insert" -> "UserForm".

2. Next, you need to add the MonthView control to your UserForm. If it's not visible in the toolbox, you can add it by right-clicking on the toolbox and selecting "Additional Controls". Scroll down until you find "Microsoft MonthView Control" and check it.

3. Now, you can add the MonthView control to your UserForm by clicking on it in the toolbox and then clicking on your UserForm.

4. You can add a button to your UserForm that will insert the selected date into a cell when clicked. To do this, add a button to your UserForm and double click on it to open the code editor. Enter the following code:

```vba
Private Sub CommandButton1_Click()
    Range("A1").Value = MonthView1.Value
    Unload Me
End Sub
```

5. Finally, you can display the UserForm with the following code:

```vba
Sub ShowForm()
    UserForm1.Show
End Sub
```

Please note that the MonthView control is not available in 64-bit versions of Office. If you're using a 64-bit version, you'll need to use a different method, such as creating a custom calendar form.
