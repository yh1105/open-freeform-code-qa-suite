The warning is due to the fact that Dart's null safety feature is enabled. The `Map` operator `[]` returns a nullable type because it could potentially return `null` if the key doesn't exist in the map. 

You can solve this warning by either checking if the value is not `null` before assigning it to the `String` variable, or by using the null assertion operator `!` to tell Dart that you are sure that the value is not `null`.

Here is the corrected code:

```dart
void foo(Map<int, String> myMap) {
  if (myMap.containsKey(1)) {
    String? s = myMap[1];
    if (s != null) {
      // Do something with s
    }
  }
}
```

Or using null assertion operator:

```dart
void foo(Map<int, String> myMap) {
  if (myMap.containsKey(1)) {
    String s = myMap[1]!;
    // Do something with s
  }
}
```

Please note that using the null assertion operator `!` can cause a runtime error if the value is actually `null`. So, use it only when you are sure that the value won't be `null`.
