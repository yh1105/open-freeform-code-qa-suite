Here is a Python function that uses dynamic programming to solve the problem:

```python
def func(n, k):
    if n == 0 or k == 0:
        return 0
    if n == 1:
        return k
    # dp[i][0] stores number of ways to form a string of length i with no consecutive characters
    # dp[i][1] stores number of ways to form a string of length i with at most two consecutive characters
    dp = [[0, 0] for _ in range(n+1)]
    dp[1][0], dp[1][1] = k, k
    for i in range(2, n+1):
        dp[i][0] = dp[i-1][1] * (k-1)
        dp[i][1] = dp[i-1][0] + dp[i-1][1] * k
    return dp[n][1]
```

The function `func` initializes a 2D dynamic programming table `dp` where `dp[i][0]` stores the number of ways to form a string of length `i` with no consecutive characters and `dp[i][1]` stores the number of ways to form a string of length `i` with at most two consecutive characters.

For each length `i` from `2` to `n`, the function computes `dp[i][0]` as the product of `dp[i-1][1]` and `k-1` (the number of ways to form a string of length `i-1` with at most two consecutive characters and the number of ways to choose a different character), and `dp[i][1]` as the sum of `dp[i-1][0]` (the number of ways to form a string of length `i-1` with no consecutive characters) and the product of `dp[i-1][1]` and `k` (the number of ways to form a string of length `i-1` with at most two consecutive characters and the number of ways to choose any character).

Finally, the function returns `dp[n][1]`, the number of ways to form a string of length `n` with at most two consecutive characters.
