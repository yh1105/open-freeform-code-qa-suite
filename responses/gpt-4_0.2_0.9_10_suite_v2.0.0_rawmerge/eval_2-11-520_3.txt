The problem is that you are trying to override the `operator==` in the derived class `SeviceClient` with a different signature than the one in the base class `IClient`. In the base class, the `operator==` is defined to take a reference to `IClient` as a parameter, but in the derived class, it takes a reference to `SeviceClient`.

To fix this, you should make the `operator==` in the derived class take a reference to `IClient` as a parameter, just like in the base class. Here's how you can do it:

```c++
bool operator==(const IClient<int8_t>& anotherClient) override {
    // You can dynamic_cast to SeviceClient if needed
    // const SeviceClient& sc = dynamic_cast<const SeviceClient&>(anotherClient);
    return true;
}
```

Remember that you should also add `virtual` and `= 0` to the `operator==` in the base class to make it a pure virtual function:

```c++
virtual bool operator==(const IClient& anotherClient) = 0;
```

And don't forget to add `public` before the inheritance of `IClient<int8_t>` in `SeviceClient`:

```c++
class SeviceClient : public IClient<int8_t> {
```

Also, note that you should add `virtual` keyword before the destructor of the base class to avoid potential memory leaks:

```c++
virtual ~IClient() {}
```
