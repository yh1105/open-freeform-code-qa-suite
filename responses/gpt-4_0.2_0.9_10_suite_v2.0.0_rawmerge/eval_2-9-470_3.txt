This error is related to the `libffi` library. The `ffi` gem is dependent on this library. When you upgraded your Ubuntu, the `libffi` library might have been upgraded to a newer version, while the `ffi` gem is still looking for the older version.

You can confirm this by checking the version of `libffi` installed on your system. The error message indicates that `ffi` gem is looking for `libffi.so.6`, but it's likely that a newer version (like `libffi.so.7`) is installed.

To check the version of `libffi` installed, you can use the following command:

```bash
ls /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/ | grep libffi
```

If `libffi.so.7` is installed, you can create a symlink to `libffi.so.6` to resolve the issue:

```bash
sudo ln -s /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libffi.so.7 /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libffi.so.6
```

This command creates a symbolic link from `libffi.so.7` to `libffi.so.6`, so when the `ffi` gem looks for `libffi.so.6`, it will find the symlink and use `libffi.so.7`.

After creating the symlink, try running the Rails command again.

If the problem persists, you might need to reinstall the `ffi` gem:

```bash
gem uninstall ffi
gem install ffi
```

This will uninstall and then reinstall the `ffi` gem, which should link it to the correct version of `libffi`.
