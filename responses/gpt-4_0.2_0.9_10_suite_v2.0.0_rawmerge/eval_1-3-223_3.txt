You can use the `pkg_resources` module to get the installed version of a package, and the `yolk3k` package to get the latest version of a package from PyPI. Here is a function that does this:

```python
import pkg_resources
from yolk.pypi import CheeseShop

def checkVersion(pkgName):
    # Get the installed version
    installed_version = pkg_resources.get_distribution(pkgName).version

    # Get the latest version
    pypi = CheeseShop()
    versions = pypi.package_releases(pkgName)
    if not versions:  # No versions found on PyPI
        return False
    latest_version = versions[0]

    # Compare the versions
    return installed_version == latest_version
```

This function will return `True` if the installed version is the latest version, and `False` otherwise.

Please note that you need to install the `yolk3k` package to use this function. You can install it with `pip install yolk3k`.

Also, this function assumes that the package is installed. If the package is not installed, `pkg_resources.get_distribution(pkgName)` will raise a `DistributionNotFound` exception. If you want to handle this case, you can modify the function to catch this exception and return `False`.
