The `apt-get` package manager installs the version of the software that is available in the repository defined for your version of the operating system. Sometimes, the version in the repository might not be the latest.

To install the latest version of cmake, you can download it from the official website and compile it from source. Here are the steps:

1. First, you need to uninstall the existing version of cmake:

```bash
sudo apt-get remove cmake
```

2. Then, download the latest version of cmake from the official website. At the time of writing, the latest version is 3.21.1. You can check the latest version from the [official cmake download page](https://cmake.org/download/).

```bash
wget https://github.com/Kitware/CMake/releases/download/v3.21.1/cmake-3.21.1.tar.gz
```

3. Extract the downloaded file:

```bash
tar -xzvf cmake-3.21.1.tar.gz
```

4. Navigate to the extracted directory:

```bash
cd cmake-3.21.1
```

5. Now, compile and install cmake:

```bash
./bootstrap
make -j$(nproc)
sudo make install
```

6. Verify the installed version of cmake:

```bash
cmake --version
```

This should display the version as 3.21.1.

Please note that you need to have the necessary permissions to install software on your system.
