It sounds like you're referring to a feature provided by a tool called Emmet. Emmet is a web-developer's toolkit that can greatly improve your HTML & CSS workflow. It allows you to use abbreviations, which it then expands into full-fledged HTML tags.

For example, if you type `.classname` and then press `Tab`, Emmet will expand it into `<div class="classname"></div>`.

To use Emmet, you need to have it installed in your code editor. Many popular code editors, like Visual Studio Code, come with Emmet built-in. If you're using a different editor, you might need to install it manually.

If you're using Visual Studio Code and Emmet isn't working, make sure that you're in an HTML file. Emmet only works in files that it recognizes as HTML. You can check the language mode in the bottom-right corner of the status bar.

If you're in an HTML file and Emmet still isn't working, you might need to check your settings. Go to `File > Preferences > Settings` (or press `Ctrl+,`), search for `Emmet`, and make sure that the `Include Languages` setting includes HTML.

If you're using a different editor, the process might be different. You can usually find instructions on how to install and enable Emmet in your editor's documentation or on the Emmet website.
