Sure, you can create a function to calculate the total number of days in a year by checking if the year is a leap year or not. Here's how you can do it:

```python
def DaysInYear(year):
    if (year % 4) == 0:
        if (year % 100) == 0:
            if (year % 400) == 0:
                return 366  # It's a leap year
            else:
                return 365  # It's not a leap year
        else:
            return 366  # It's a leap year
    else:
        return 365  # It's not a leap year
```

This function works by checking if the year is evenly divisible by 4, 100, and 400. According to the Gregorian calendar, a year is a leap year if:

- It is evenly divisible by 4;
- Except for end-of-century years which must be divisible by 400. This means that the year 2000 was a leap year, although 1900 was not.

So, if you call `DaysInYear(2020)`, it will return `366`. If you call `DaysInYear(2019)`, it will return `365`.
