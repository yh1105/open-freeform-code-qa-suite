The error message you're seeing is due to the Django URL dispatcher not being able to find a match for the URL pattern you've specified in your template. 

The problem is in your `index.html` file:

```html
<a href="{% url 'profile' post.author.username %}">
    @{{post.author.username}}
</a>
```

The error is occurring because `post.author.username` is empty or `None` for at least one of your `post` objects. The URL dispatcher is trying to reverse match the URL pattern for 'profile' with an empty string, which it can't do, hence the `NoReverseMatch` error.

To fix this, you need to ensure that `post.author.username` is not empty or `None`. You can do this by adding a check in your template before trying to create the URL:

```html
{% if post.author.username %}
    <a href="{% url 'profile' post.author.username %}">
        @{{post.author.username}}
    </a>
{% else %}
    <p>No author</p>
{% endif %}
```

This will only try to create the URL if `post.author.username` is not empty, otherwise it will display "No author". 

Also, make sure that you are correctly setting the `author` when you create a `NewPost` object in your `views.py`:

```python
post = NewPost(title=title, description=description, author=request.user)
```

Ensure that `request.user` is not `None` and that it has a `username`.
