The error message indicates that there is a problem with the command you're trying to run. It seems like there is an issue with the embedded quotes in your command.

Here's how you can fix it:

1. Make sure that the paths to your files do not contain any spaces. If they do, you should enclose the entire path in quotes.

2. Check if the command you're trying to run is correct. The error message indicates that the command `cmd` cannot be run. Make sure that the path to `cmd` is correct and that it exists on your system.

3. If the paths are correct, try removing the embedded quotes from the command. For example, instead of `"C:\Program Files\NetBeans-11.1\netbeans\java\maven\bin\mvn.cmd"`, try using `C:\Program Files\NetBeans-11.1\netbeans\java\maven\bin\mvn.cmd`.

4. If the problem persists, try running the command directly from the command line to see if it works. If it does, the problem might be with NetBeans.

5. If none of the above solutions work, you might want to consider reinstalling NetBeans. It's possible that something went wrong during the installation process.

Remember to replace the paths in the command with the actual paths on your system.
