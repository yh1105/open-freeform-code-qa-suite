The error message "could not resolve macro `$crate::format_args`" is coming from the Rust Analyzer, which is a language server protocol implementation for Rust. It's not an error from the Rust compiler itself. 

Rust Analyzer sometimes has issues with macro resolution, especially in more complex scenarios. This error message means that Rust Analyzer is having trouble understanding the `format_args!` macro, which is used internally by the `assert_eq!` macro in your test.

If your code compiles and runs correctly, then this is likely a false positive from Rust Analyzer. You can try the following steps to resolve this issue:

1. **Update Rust Analyzer**: Make sure you are using the latest version of Rust Analyzer. Updates often include bug fixes, and this issue might have been resolved in a newer version.

2. **Restart your editor**: Sometimes, Rust Analyzer can get into a bad state, and restarting your editor can help.

3. **Check your Rust toolchain**: Make sure you're using a recent stable version of the Rust toolchain. You can update it with `rustup update`.

4. **Check your `rust-analyzer` settings**: If you're using VS Code, you can check your settings by going to `File -> Preferences -> Settings` and searching for `rust-analyzer`. Make sure the `rust-analyzer.checkOnSave.command` is set to `check`.

If none of these steps help, you might want to consider reporting this as a bug to the Rust Analyzer team. They are usually very responsive and might be able to provide a fix or workaround.
