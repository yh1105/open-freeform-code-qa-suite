The error message indicates that the zlib library, which is a required dependency when compiling Pillow from source, could not be found. 

However, the Pillow version you are trying to install (6.0.0) does not support Python 3.8, which is the Python version you are using. 

To solve this problem, you should install a more recent version of Pillow that supports Python 3.8. You can do this by running the following command:

```bash
pip install pillow --upgrade
```

This command will upgrade Pillow to the latest version. If you still encounter issues, it might be a problem with your Python environment. You can try creating a new virtual environment and then installing Pillow within that environment. 

Here is how you can create a new virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv myenv
```

Then, activate the environment:

On Windows:

```bash
myenv\Scripts\activate
```

On Unix or MacOS:

```bash
source myenv/bin/activate
```

Finally, install Pillow in the new environment:

```bash
pip install pillow
```
