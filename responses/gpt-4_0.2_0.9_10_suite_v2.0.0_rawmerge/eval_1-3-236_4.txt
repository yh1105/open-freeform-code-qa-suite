The setting `"python.linting.jediEnabled": false` is not the correct one to disable Jedi. This setting is for disabling Jedi as the IntelliSense engine, not as a linter.

To disable Jedi as a linter, you need to set the following in your settings.json:

```json
"python.linting.pylintEnabled": true,
"python.linting.enabled": true
```

This will enable Pylint as your linter. 

If you still get error messages from Jedi, it might be because Jedi is still being used as your IntelliSense engine. To disable it, you should use:

```json
"python.jediEnabled": false,
"python.languageServer": "Pylance"
```

This will disable Jedi and set Pylance as your IntelliSense engine. If you prefer to use Microsoft Python Language Server, you can set `"python.languageServer": "Microsoft"` instead.

Remember to reload your VS Code after modifying your settings.json for the changes to take effect.
