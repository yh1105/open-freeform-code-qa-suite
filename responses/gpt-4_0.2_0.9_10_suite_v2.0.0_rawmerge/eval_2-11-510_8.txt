The error you're encountering is because you're trying to use the `std::filesystem` namespace, but you've included the `<experimental/filesystem>` library. In C++17, the filesystem library was still experimental and was not yet part of the standard library. 

To fix this, you should use the `std::experimental::filesystem` namespace instead of `std::filesystem`. Here's how you can modify your code:

```c++
#include <experimental/filesystem>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

namespace fs = std::experimental::filesystem;

int main(int argc, char** argv)
{
    std::string imageDirectory = "./image";
    std::vector<std::string> imagePath;
    for (const auto& entry: fs::directory_iterator(imageDirectory))
    {
        imagePath.push_back(entry.path());
        std::cout << entry.path() << std::endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
```

In this code, `fs` is a namespace alias for `std::experimental::filesystem`, which makes the code easier to read and write.

If you're using a compiler that supports C++17 or later, you can use the `<filesystem>` library and the `std::filesystem` namespace directly. In that case, you should replace `<experimental/filesystem>` with `<filesystem>` and `std::experimental::filesystem` with `std::filesystem`.
