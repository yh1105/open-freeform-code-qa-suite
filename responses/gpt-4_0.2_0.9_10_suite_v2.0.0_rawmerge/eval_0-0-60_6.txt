The error message you're seeing is because Bootstrap requires `Popper.js` for the dropdowns and other interactive components to work.

You can install `Popper.js` via npm by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm install popper.js --save
```

After installing `Popper.js`, you need to import it into your project. If you're using ES6 modules, you can do this with:

```javascript
import Popper from 'popper.js';
```

Or if you're using CommonJS modules:

```javascript
const Popper = require('popper.js');
```

Now, you should be able to compile your project without the "Module not found: Can't resolve 'popper.js'" error.

If you're using Bootstrap with a bundler like Webpack, you might need to add an alias to your Webpack configuration to ensure that `Popper.js` is correctly resolved:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  //...
  resolve: {
    alias: {
      'popper.js': path.resolve(__dirname, 'node_modules/popper.js'),
    },
  },
};
```

Replace `__dirname` with the path to your `node_modules` directory if it's not in the same directory as your Webpack configuration file.
