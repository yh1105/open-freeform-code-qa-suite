The `ext-zip` is a PHP extension, not a Composer package, so you can't install it using Composer. 

The error message you're seeing is because Composer is trying to find a package named `ext-zip`, but it doesn't exist.

To solve this issue, you need to install the `zip` extension for PHP. The process to do this depends on your operating system.

**For Ubuntu/Debian:**

You can install it using the following commands:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install php-zip
```

**For CentOS/RHEL:**

You can use the following command:

```bash
sudo yum install php-pecl-zip
```

**For Windows:**

1. Open your `php.ini` file.
2. Find the line `;extension=php_zip.dll`.
3. Uncomment it by removing the semicolon at the start.
4. Save and close the `php.ini` file.
5. Restart your web server.

**For MacOS:**

If you're using Homebrew, you can use the following command:

```bash
brew install php@7.3-zip
```

Remember to replace `7.3` with your PHP version.

After installing the PHP zip extension, you may need to restart your web server for the changes to take effect. 

Then, you can tell Composer that your project requires the PHP zip extension by adding it to the `require` section of your `composer.json` file like this:

```json
"require": {
    "php": "^7.1",
    "ext-zip": "*"
}
```

Then run `composer update` to update your project dependencies.
