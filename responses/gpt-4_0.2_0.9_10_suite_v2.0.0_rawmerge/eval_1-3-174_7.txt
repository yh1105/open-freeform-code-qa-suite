The error message `ImportError: DLL load failed while importing _psycopg: The operating system cannot run %1.` suggests that the psycopg2 library is not able to find the necessary DLL files to run.

This issue can be caused by several reasons:

1. The psycopg2 library is not installed correctly.
2. The necessary DLL files are not in the PATH.
3. The necessary DLL files are not compatible with your system.

Here are some steps you can take to troubleshoot this issue:

1. **Reinstall psycopg2**: Uninstall psycopg2 and then reinstall it. You can do this with the following commands:

```bash
conda remove psycopg2
conda install -c anaconda psycopg2
```

2. **Install psycopg2-binary**: The psycopg2-binary package is a stand-alone package that includes its own PostgreSQL binary libraries. You can install it with the following command:

```bash
pip install psycopg2-binary
```

3. **Check your PATH**: Make sure that the necessary DLL files are in your PATH. You can do this by checking the PATH environment variable in your system settings.

4. **Check DLL compatibility**: Make sure that the DLL files are compatible with your system. You can do this by checking the system requirements of the psycopg2 library and comparing them with your system specifications.

5. **Check if PostgreSQL is installed**: psycopg2 is a PostgreSQL adapter for python, it requires PostgreSQL to be installed on your machine. If it's not installed, you can download it from the official PostgreSQL website.

If none of these steps work, you may need to consider using a different PostgreSQL adapter or using a different system that is compatible with psycopg2.
