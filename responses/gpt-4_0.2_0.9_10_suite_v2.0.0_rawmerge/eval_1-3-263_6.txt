The `f` before the string in the `print` function in Python is used to create what's called an f-string (formatted string literal). It was introduced in Python 3.6.

F-strings provide a concise and convenient way to embed expressions inside string literals for formatting. 

Here's a simple example:

```python
name = "John"
print(f"Hello, {name}")
```

This will output:

```
Hello, John
```

In your code:

```python
print(f"Input directory: {args.input_directory}")
print(f"Output directory: {args.output_directory}")
```

The expressions inside the curly braces `{}` are replaced by their values. The `args.input_directory` and `args.output_directory` are variables that hold the input and output directories respectively. The f-string will replace `{args.input_directory}` and `{args.output_directory}` with the values of these variables.

So if `args.input_directory` is `"/home/user/input"` and `args.output_directory` is `"/home/user/output"`, the output will be:

```
Input directory: /home/user/input
Output directory: /home/user/output
```
