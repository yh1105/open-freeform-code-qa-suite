Your code seems fine at first glance. However, there are a few things you can check to troubleshoot the issue:

1. **Network Connection:** Make sure your device/emulator has a proper internet connection. Sometimes, network issues can cause such problems.

2. **Server Availability:** Check if the server at 'https://48p1r2roz4.sse.codesandbox.io' is up and running. You can use tools like Postman or simply your browser to check if the server is responding.

3. **Query Syntax:** Make sure the query you are sending is correct and the server supports it. You can test your query using a GraphQL playground.

4. **Apollo Client Version:** There might be compatibility issues with the version of Apollo Client you are using. Try downgrading or upgrading the version.

5. **Error Handling:** You can get more information about the error by logging it. Modify your error handling code as follows:

```javascript
if (error) {
    console.error(error);
    return <Text>Error :(</Text>;
}
```

6. **React Native Debugger:** Use React Native Debugger to inspect the network request and see what's actually being sent and received.

7. **Apollo Client Setup:** Make sure the Apollo Client is set up correctly. You can try to create a new Apollo Client instance with a different URI to see if it works.

If none of the above solutions work, it might be an issue with the Apollo Client library itself. You can check their GitHub issues page to see if anyone else has encountered the same problem.
