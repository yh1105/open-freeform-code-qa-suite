The error message is telling you that Vue.js expects the `:key` attribute in a `v-for` loop to be a primitive value, such as a string or a number. In your case, you're using `comment` as the key, which is a non-primitive value (an object).

To fix this, you should use a unique primitive value from each `comment` object as the key. If each comment has a unique id, you could use that:

```html
<div v-for="comment in comments" :key="comment.id">
```

If there's no unique id, you could use the index of the loop:

```html
<div v-for="(comment, index) in comments" :key="index">
```

Remember, the `:key` attribute is used by Vue.js to track each node's identity, and it must be unique. This is important for Vue's diffing algorithm when it updates the DOM.
