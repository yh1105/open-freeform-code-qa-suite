This error can occur due to a variety of reasons. Here are some possible solutions:

1. **Check your code signing settings:** Make sure you have the correct provisioning profiles selected for your target in Xcode. Also, ensure that the correct signing certificate is selected in your keychain.

2. **Check your script phases:** If you have any custom script phases in your build settings, make sure they are correct and not causing the error.

3. **Check your dependencies:** Make sure all your dependencies are correctly installed and up to date. You can try to update them using `pod update`.

4. **Clean and rebuild your project:** You can do this by going to `Product -> Clean Build Folder` in Xcode.

5. **Delete derived data:** You can do this by going to `Window -> Projects -> Your Project -> Delete Derived Data`.

6. **Check your Podfile:** Make sure that all the pods you are using are compatible with each other and with your version of Swift and Xcode.

7. **Check the error message:** The error message you are seeing should give you more information about what is causing the error. You can also check the build log for more details.

8. **Check your Swift version:** Some pods may not be compatible with the Swift version you are using. You can specify the Swift version for each pod in your Podfile.

If none of these solutions work, you may need to look more closely at your specific setup and configuration. You might also consider asking for help on a site like Stack Overflow, where you can provide more details about your problem and get help from a larger community of developers.
