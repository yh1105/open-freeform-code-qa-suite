Sure, here is a bash script that will install a specific version of Python using Homebrew:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Unlink the current version of Python
brew unlink python

# Install the desired version of Python
brew install python@3.6

# Link the installed version of Python
brew link python@3.6
```

Please note that you may need to adjust your PATH to use the newly installed version of Python.
