You can use the `source` command to reload your `.bash_profile` without closing and reopening your terminal. Here's how:

```bash
source ~/.bash_profile
```

This command reads and executes commands from the filename argument in the current shell context. If you made changes to your `.bash_profile`, this will apply them to your current terminal session.

If you're using a different shell, you would source that file instead. For example, if you're using zsh, you would use:

```bash
source ~/.zshrc
```

This is equivalent to:

```bash
. ~/.zshrc
```

The `.` command is a synonym for `source`.
