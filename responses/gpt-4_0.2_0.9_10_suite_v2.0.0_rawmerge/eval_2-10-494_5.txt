The error message "could not resolve macro `$crate::format_args`" is coming from the Rust Analyzer, which is a language server protocol implementation for Rust. It's not an error from the Rust compiler itself. This error message means that the Rust Analyzer is having trouble resolving the `format_args!` macro, which is used internally by the `assert_eq!` macro in your test.

This is likely a bug or limitation in Rust Analyzer, not an issue with your code. If your code is compiling and running correctly, and your tests are passing, then your code is likely fine.

Here's a few things you can try to resolve this issue:

1. **Update Rust Analyzer**: Make sure you're using the latest version of Rust Analyzer. Updates often include bug fixes, so this issue might have been resolved in a newer version.

2. **Restart your editor**: Sometimes, the language server can get into a bad state, and restarting your editor can help.

3. **Check your Rust version**: Make sure you're using a version of Rust that's compatible with your version of Rust Analyzer.

4. **Disable and re-enable Rust Analyzer**: This can sometimes help if the language server has gotten into a bad state.

5. **Ignore the error**: If your code is compiling and running correctly, and your tests are passing, then this error message is likely a false positive. You can choose to ignore it.

Remember that Rust Analyzer is a tool to help you write Rust code, but it's not always perfect. Sometimes, it can report errors that aren't actually there. If your code is working correctly, then you can usually trust that over what Rust Analyzer is saying.
