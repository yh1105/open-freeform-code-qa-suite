This error is due to the missing `libffi` library in your macOS. You can install it using Homebrew. If you don't have Homebrew installed, you can install it first.

Here are the steps:

1. Install Homebrew:

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

2. Install `libffi`:

```bash
brew install libffi
```

3. After installing `libffi`, you need to set the `PKG_CONFIG_PATH` environment variable to the path where `libffi.pc` is located. This is usually `/usr/local/Cellar/libffi/<version>/lib/pkgconfig/`. Replace `<version>` with the version of `libffi` you installed.

```bash
export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/local/Cellar/libffi/<version>/lib/pkgconfig/
```

4. Now, you should be able to install `travis`:

```bash
gem install travis
```

Remember to replace `<version>` with your actual `libffi` version. You can check the version by running `brew info libffi`.
