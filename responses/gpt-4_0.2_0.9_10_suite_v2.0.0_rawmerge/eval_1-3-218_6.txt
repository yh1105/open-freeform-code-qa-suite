You can use the `str.replace()` function in pandas to replace the special characters with an empty string. Here is the function you requested:

```python
def remove(df):
    df['LGA'] = df['LGA'].str.replace(r"\(.*\)", "")
    return df
```

This function uses a regular expression to match any characters between parentheses and replace them with an empty string. The `.*` in the regular expression matches any character (except a newline) 0 or more times. The `\(` and `\)` escape the parentheses, so they are treated as literal characters rather than special regex characters.

Please note that this will remove all characters between parentheses, not just at the end of the string. If you only want to remove characters in parentheses at the end of the string, you can use the `$` character in the regex, which matches the end of the string:

```python
def remove(df):
    df['LGA'] = df['LGA'].str.replace(r"\(.*\)$", "")
    return df
```

This will only remove characters between parentheses if they are at the end of the string.
