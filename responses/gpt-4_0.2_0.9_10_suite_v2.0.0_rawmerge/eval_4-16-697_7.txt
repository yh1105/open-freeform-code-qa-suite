The `~/.bashrc` file is not sourced when a Docker container is run because Docker does not start a login shell by default. The `CMD` and `ENTRYPOINT` instructions run commands without a shell, which means that shell profiles such as `~/.bashrc` or `~/.bash_profile` are not sourced.

To solve this issue, you can source the `~/.bashrc` file in your `launch.sh` script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

source ~/.bashrc

cd /workspace/demo
npm install
node index.js
```

Alternatively, you can use `bash -c` in the `CMD` instruction to start a shell and then run your script:

```Dockerfile
CMD ["/bin/bash", "-c", "/workspace/launch.sh"]
```

This will start a shell and then run your script, which should source the `~/.bashrc` file if it's a login shell. However, this approach might not work if `~/.bashrc` is not sourced in non-interactive shells. In this case, you should stick to sourcing `~/.bashrc` in your script.
