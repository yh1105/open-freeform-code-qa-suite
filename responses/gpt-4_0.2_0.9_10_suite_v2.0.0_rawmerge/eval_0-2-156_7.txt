From your HTML code, it seems that the "Stop Game" button is inside the `#GameRunning` div, which is probably positioned behind the game frame. To move the "Stop Game" button to the top, you can use CSS positioning properties such as `position: absolute;` or `position: fixed;` and then use `top`, `right`, `bottom`, and `left` properties to position it exactly where you want.

Here is an example of how you can modify your CSS:

```css
#GameRunning {
    position: absolute;
    top: 10px; /* Adjust this value to position the button vertically */
    right: 10px; /* Adjust this value to position the button horizontally */
}
```

This will position the "Stop Game" button at the top right of the page. You can adjust the `top` and `right` values to position the button exactly where you want.

However, please note that using `position: absolute;` will position the element relative to the nearest positioned ancestor. If an absolute positioned element has no positioned ancestors, it uses the document body, and moves along with page scrolling.

If you want the "Stop Game" button to stay at the same place even when the page is scrolled, you can use `position: fixed;` instead of `position: absolute;`.

```css
#GameRunning {
    position: fixed;
    top: 10px; /* Adjust this value to position the button vertically */
    right: 10px; /* Adjust this value to position the button horizontally */
}
```

This will make the "Stop Game" button stay at the same place even when the page is scrolled.
