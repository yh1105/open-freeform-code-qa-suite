The error message you're seeing suggests that the directory you're trying to create (`/data/db`) is on a read-only file system. On macOS, the root directory (`/`) is typically read-only as of Catalina (macOS 10.15) due to the introduction of the read-only system volume.

If you're trying to create a directory for MongoDB (which commonly uses `/data/db`), you might want to consider creating this directory in your home directory or another writable location.

Here's an example of how you could do this:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/data/db
```

This command will create a `data/db` directory in your home directory (`~`).

Then, when starting MongoDB, you can specify this path with the `--dbpath` option:

```bash
mongod --dbpath ~/data/db
```

This will tell MongoDB to use the `data/db` directory in your home directory as the data directory.
