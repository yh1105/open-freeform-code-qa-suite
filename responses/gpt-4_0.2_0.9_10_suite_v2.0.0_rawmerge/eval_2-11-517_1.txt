In C++, there is no built-in syntax for string interpolation like in C# or JavaScript. However, you can achieve similar results using `std::stringstream` or `std::to_string` function for simple cases. Here is an example:

```cpp
#include <sstream>
#include <string>

int main() {
    int myVariable = 10;
    std::stringstream ss;
    ss << "My variable has value " << myVariable;
    std::string result = ss.str();
    // result now contains "My variable has value 10"
}
```

Or using `std::to_string`:

```cpp
#include <string>

int main() {
    int myVariable = 10;
    std::string result = "My variable has value " + std::to_string(myVariable);
    // result now contains "My variable has value 10"
}
```

For more complex cases, you might want to consider using a formatting library like `fmt` or `boost::format`. For example, with `fmt` library, you can do:

```cpp
#include <fmt/core.h>

int main() {
    int myVariable = 10;
    std::string result = fmt::format("My variable has value {}", myVariable);
    // result now contains "My variable has value 10"
}
```

Please note that you need to install and link these libraries to use them.
