You can achieve the desired effect by using Tailwind CSS's utility classes. Here's an example of how you can do it:

```html
<a href="#" class="group relative text-sky-600 transition duration-300">
    Link
    <span class="absolute w-0 h-0.5 bg-sky-600 transition-all duration-500 group-hover:w-full block bottom-0 left-0"></span>
</a>
```

In this example, I've made the following changes:

- I've added the `relative` class to the anchor tag. This is because the child span is using absolute positioning, so we need to ensure it's positioned relative to the anchor tag.
- I've added the `absolute` class to the span. This allows us to position it at the bottom of the anchor tag.
- I've added the `w-0` class to the span. This sets its initial width to 0.
- I've added the `transition-all` class to the span. This ensures that all properties will transition smoothly.
- I've added the `group-hover:w-full` class to the span. This sets the width to full when the parent anchor tag is hovered over.

This will create a smooth animation where a line grows from the left to the right under the link when it's hovered over.
