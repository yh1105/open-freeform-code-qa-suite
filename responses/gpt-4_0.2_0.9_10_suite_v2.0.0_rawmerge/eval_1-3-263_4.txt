The `f` before the string in the `print` function is used to denote a formatted string literal, or f-string. This is a feature introduced in Python 3.6. 

F-strings provide a concise and convenient way to embed expressions inside string literals for formatting. 

In your example, `args.input_directory` and `args.output_directory` are expressions that get evaluated and their values are inserted into the string.

Here's how it works:

```python
print(f"Input directory: {args.input_directory}")
```

The expression inside the curly braces `{}` is `args.input_directory`. Python will evaluate this expression, convert the result to a string, and insert that string into the larger string where the curly braces were.

So if `args.input_directory` is `/home/user/input`, the output of the print statement will be:

```
Input directory: /home/user/input
```

The same concept applies to the second print statement.
