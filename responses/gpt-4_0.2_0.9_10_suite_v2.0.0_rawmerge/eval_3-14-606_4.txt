It seems like there's a bit of confusion here. iOS doesn't have a "Developer Mode" that can be enabled like Android. However, if you're trying to install a provisioned testing build, you'll need to have the device's UDID registered with your Apple Developer account and the app properly signed.

Here are the steps to install a provisioned testing build:

1. **Register your device's UDID with your Apple Developer account.**

    - Connect your device to your Mac.
    - Open Xcode.
    - Go to Window > Devices and Simulators.
    - Select your device from the list on the left.
    - The Identifier listed is your device's UDID.
    - Log into your Apple Developer account online.
    - Go to Certificates, Identifiers & Profiles.
    - Under Devices, click the '+' button to add a new device.
    - Enter a name for the device and the UDID, then click Continue.

2. **Ensure the app is properly signed.**

    - In Xcode, go to your project's settings.
    - Select your target, then go to the Signing & Capabilities tab.
    - Make sure Automatically manage signing is checked.
    - Select your Apple Developer account from the Team dropdown.
    - If there are any errors, Xcode should provide instructions to resolve them.

3. **Build and install the app.**

    - With your device still connected to your Mac, select it as the build target in Xcode.
    - Press Cmd+R to build and run the app.
    - The app should install and launch on your device.

If you're still having trouble, the issue might be with the provisioning profile used to sign the app. Make sure the profile includes your device's UDID and the correct app ID.
