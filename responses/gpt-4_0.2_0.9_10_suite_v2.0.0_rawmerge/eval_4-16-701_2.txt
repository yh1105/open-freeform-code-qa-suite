You can use the `$env:Path` variable in PowerShell to access the PATH environment variable. Here's a function that checks if a specified folder is in the PATH:

```powershell
function FolderIsInPATH($Path_to_directory) {
    $paths = $env:Path -split ';'
    return $paths -contains $Path_to_directory
}
```

This function splits the PATH variable into an array of paths using the semicolon as a delimiter, then checks if the specified directory is in that array. It returns `$true` if the directory is in the PATH, and `$false` otherwise.
