The error you're experiencing might be due to several reasons. Here are a few things you could try:

1. **Check SeleniumBasic and Browser Driver Version Compatibility**: Ensure that the version of SeleniumBasic you're using is compatible with the version of the browser driver (e.g., ChromeDriver for Google Chrome, GeckoDriver for Firefox, etc.). If they're not compatible, you might need to download a different version of the browser driver.

2. **Check Excel Trust Center Settings**: In Excel, go to `File > Options > Trust Center > Trust Center Settings > Macro Settings` and ensure that `Trust access to the VBA project object model` is checked.

3. **Register the Selenium Type Library**: In the VBA editor, go to `Tools > References` and ensure that `Selenium Type Library` is checked. If it's not in the list, you might need to browse for it and add it manually.

4. **Reinstall SeleniumBasic**: Uninstall SeleniumBasic, restart your computer, and then reinstall SeleniumBasic. This can help if there are any issues with the installation.

5. **Try a Different Browser**: If you're still having issues, try using a different browser. For example, if you're currently using Internet Explorer, try using Google Chrome or Firefox instead.

Here's an example of how you might modify your code to use Google Chrome instead of Internet Explorer:

```vba
Dim driver As New WebDriver
Dim keyObj As Selenium.keys

Set keyObj = New Selenium.keys

driver.Start "chrome", "https://www.google.com/"
driver.Window.Maximize
```
