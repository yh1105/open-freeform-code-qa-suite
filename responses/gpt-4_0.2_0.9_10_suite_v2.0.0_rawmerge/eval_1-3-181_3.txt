Sure, here is a function that does what you need:

```python
import numpy as np

def getMax(matrix):
    return np.max(matrix[:,:,2], axis=1).reshape(-1,1)
```

This function works by taking the maximum along the third column (index 2) for each 2D sub-array in your 3D array. The `reshape(-1,1)` part is used to make sure the result is a 2D array with one column, as you requested.

Here is how you can use this function with your data:

```python
data = np.array([[[4, 1, 5, 2, 5, 5, 7, 8, 9, 7],
                  [7, 4, 2, 4, 7, 8, 4, 1, 3, 5],
                  [6, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 7, 6],
                  [5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 4, 3, 8, 7, 1],
                  [2, 8, 6, 7, 4, 7, 5, 5, 5, 1]],

                 [[9, 9, 5, 8, 0, 7, 3, 9, 8, 1],
                  [9, 1, 9, 5, 7, 4, 5, 4, 7, 0],
                  [1, 0, 4, 8, 7, 3, 4, 3, 8, 8],
                  [8, 1, 3, 1, 7, 0, 9, 9, 3, 8],
                  [4, 0, 2, 3, 8, 2, 0, 1, 2, 4]],

                 [[1, 6, 2, 4, 4, 0, 2, 3, 0, 3],
                  [9, 6, 8, 6, 6, 5, 6, 9, 4, 1],
                  [0
