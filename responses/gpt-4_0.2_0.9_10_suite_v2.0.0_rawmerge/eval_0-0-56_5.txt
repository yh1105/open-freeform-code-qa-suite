The issue you're experiencing is likely due to Vite's server not being accessible from outside the Docker container. By default, Vite's development server only listens on the localhost interface. This means that it's not accessible from outside the Docker container, even though you've published the port.

To fix this, you need to configure Vite to listen on all network interfaces. You can do this by setting the `host` option in the `server` section of your Vite configuration to `'0.0.0.0'`.

Here's how you can modify your `vite.config.ts` file:

```typescript
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import vue from '@vitejs/plugin-vue'

// https://vitejs.dev/config/
export default defineConfig({
    resolve: { alias: { '@': '/src' } },
    plugins: [vue()],
    server: {
        host: '0.0.0.0', // Add this line
        port: 8080
    }
})
```

This tells Vite to listen on all network interfaces, making the development server accessible from outside the Docker container. After making this change, you should be able to access your Vite server from your host machine.
