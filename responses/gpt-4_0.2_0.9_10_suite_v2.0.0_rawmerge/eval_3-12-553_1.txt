The error message indicates that your Flutter project is not using AndroidX. AndroidX is a major improvement to the original Android Support Library, which is no longer maintained. It provides parity across all devices running Android 9 (API level 28) and later.

To fix this issue, you need to migrate your project to AndroidX. Here are the steps to do so:

1. Backup your project.
2. Open your project's `android/gradle.properties` file.
3. Add the following lines:

```markdown
android.useAndroidX=true
android.enableJetifier=true
```

4. Update your `compileSdkVersion` to `28` in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```markdown
android {
    compileSdkVersion 28

    ...
}
```

5. Change your app dependencies to the AndroidX equivalents. For example, if you're using the `android.support` libraries in your `android/app/build.gradle` file, you should change them to the corresponding `androidx` libraries.

6. Clean your project and rebuild.

```bash
flutter clean
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

If you're still facing issues, you might need to manually migrate your project to AndroidX. You can do this by opening your project in Android Studio, and then going to `Refactor > Migrate to AndroidX`. 

Remember to test your app thoroughly after the migration to ensure everything is working as expected.
