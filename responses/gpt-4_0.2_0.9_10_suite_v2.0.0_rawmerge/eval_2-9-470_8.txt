The error message is indicating that the ffi gem is trying to load the `libffi.so.6` shared library, but it cannot find it. This is likely because the upgrade to your OS included an upgrade to libffi, which is now at a version higher than 6.

You can confirm this by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
find /usr -name 'libffi.so*'
```

This will search the `/usr` directory for any files that start with `libffi.so`. If your libffi library is at a version higher than 6, you should see it in the results.

To fix the issue, you can try reinstalling the ffi gem, which should link it against the correct version of libffi. Here's how you can do it:

1. Uninstall the ffi gem:

    ```bash
    gem uninstall ffi
    ```

2. Reinstall the ffi gem:

    ```bash
    gem install ffi
    ```

If this doesn't work, you might need to specify the directory where libffi is located when you install the ffi gem. You can do this with the `--with-ldflags` option. Here's an example:

```bash
gem install ffi -- --with-ldflags='-L /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu'
```

Replace `/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu` with the directory where your `libffi.so` file is located.

If you're using bundler, you might need to run `bundle config build.ffi --with-ldflags='-L /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu'` before running `bundle install`.

Remember to replace `/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu` with the directory where your `libffi.so` file is located.
