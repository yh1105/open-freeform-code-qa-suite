The error message you're seeing is related to the Java version you're using. Jacoco 0.8.6 is not compatible with Java 9 and above. 

You have two options to resolve this issue:

1. Downgrade your Java version to 8. This is not recommended as it might affect other parts of your project that require a newer Java version.

2. Upgrade your Jacoco version to 0.8.7 or above. This version has support for Java 9 and above. 

Here's how you can upgrade your Jacoco version:

```groovy
jacoco {
    toolVersion = "0.8.7"
}
```

After making this change, try running your tests again. If you're still facing issues, please provide more details about your setup.
