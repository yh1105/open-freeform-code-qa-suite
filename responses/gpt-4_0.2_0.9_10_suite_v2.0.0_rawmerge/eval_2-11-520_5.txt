The issue is that you are trying to override the `operator==` in the `SeviceClient` class with a different signature than the one in the base class `IClient`. In the base class, the `operator==` is defined to take a reference to an `IClient` object, while in the derived class, it's defined to take a reference to a `SeviceClient` object.

To fix the issue, you should change the `operator==` in the `SeviceClient` class to take a reference to an `IClient` object. Here is the corrected code:

```c++
class SeviceClient : public IClient<int8_t> {
  const std::vector<int8_t> ID;

 public:
  SeviceClient(const std::vector<int8_t>& ID) : ID(std::move(ID)) {}
  SeviceClient(std::vector<int8_t>&& ID) : ID(std::move(ID)) {}

  const std::vector<int8_t>& getID() override {
      return ID;
  }
  bool isEqual(const std::vector<int8_t>& anotherID) override {
      return true;
  }
  bool operator==(const IClient<int8_t>& anotherClient) override {
      return true;
  }
};
```

Please note that you may want to implement the actual comparison logic in the `isEqual` and `operator==` methods. Right now, they just return `true` regardless of the input.
