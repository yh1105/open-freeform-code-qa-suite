The `ext-zip` is a PHP extension, not a Composer package. This means you can't install it using Composer. You need to install it on your system using the appropriate command for your operating system.

Here's how you can install it on different operating systems:

**Ubuntu/Debian**

```bash
sudo apt-get install php-zip
```

**CentOS/RedHat**

```bash
sudo yum install php-pecl-zip
```

**macOS (using Homebrew)**

```bash
brew install php@7.3
brew link --overwrite --force php@7.3
```

After installing the extension, you may need to restart your web server for the changes to take effect.

If you're using PHPStorm, you may also need to configure it to use the correct PHP interpreter. You can do this in the settings under `Languages & Frameworks > PHP`.

If you're using a `composer.json` file, you can specify the requirement for the `ext-zip` extension like this:

```json
{
    "require": {
        "php": "^7.1",
        "ext-zip": "*"
    }
}
```

This won't install the extension, but it will prevent Composer from installing your project unless the `ext-zip` extension is present.
