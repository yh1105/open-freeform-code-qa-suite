Yes, there is an unofficial adapter for React 17 from the `@wojtekmaj/enzyme-adapter-react-17` package. You can install it using npm:

```bash
npm install --save @wojtekmaj/enzyme-adapter-react-17
```

Then you can use it in your code like this:

```javascript
import Enzyme from 'enzyme';
import Adapter from '@wojtekmaj/enzyme-adapter-react-17';

Enzyme.configure({ adapter: new Adapter() });
```

This should allow you to use Enzyme with React 17.0.1. Please note that this is an unofficial package, and it may not be as reliable or as well-maintained as the official Enzyme adapters.
