The warning you're seeing is because Elasticsearch 7.13.1 has built-in security features that are not enabled by default. Without these security features, your Elasticsearch cluster could be accessible to anyone. 

To fix this, you need to enable Elasticsearch's built-in security features. Here's how you can do it:

1. Open your Elasticsearch configuration file (`elasticsearch.yml`). This file is usually located in the `/etc/elasticsearch` or `/usr/local/etc/elasticsearch` directory.

2. Add the following lines to the `elasticsearch.yml` file:

    ```yaml
    xpack.security.enabled: true
    xpack.security.transport.ssl.enabled: true
    ```

3. Save the changes and close the file.

4. Restart Elasticsearch to apply the changes. If you installed Elasticsearch with Homebrew, you can restart it with the following command:

    ```bash
    brew services restart elasticsearch
    ```

5. After restarting Elasticsearch, you need to set up passwords for the built-in users. You can do this with the `elasticsearch-setup-passwords` command. Run the following command in your terminal:

    ```bash
    ./bin/elasticsearch-setup-passwords auto
    ```

    This command will generate random passwords for all built-in users and output them to the console.

6. Update your application's Elasticsearch client to use the appropriate username and password. If you're using Searchkick, you can do this by setting the `ELASTICSEARCH_URL` environment variable to a URL that includes the username and password:

    ```bash
    export ELASTICSEARCH_URL="https://username:password@localhost:9200"
    ```

    Replace `username` and `password` with the actual username and password for your Elasticsearch cluster.

Please note that enabling security will also enable TLS for the transport networking layer, which means you'll need to configure TLS certificates. If you don't want to use TLS, you can disable it by setting `xpack.security.transport.ssl.enabled` to `false` in the `elasticsearch.yml` file. However, this is not recommended for production environments.
