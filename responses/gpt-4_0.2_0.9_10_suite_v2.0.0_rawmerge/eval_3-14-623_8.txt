This error can be caused by a variety of issues, but here are a few potential solutions that you can try:

1. **Clean the build folder**: In Xcode, go to `Product > Clean Build Folder`. This will remove all the compiled files and force Xcode to recompile everything. This can often fix issues where Xcode is using an outdated or corrupted compiled file.

2. **Delete derived data**: Derived data includes all the intermediate build information and products. Sometimes, this data can become corrupted, causing build errors. You can delete derived data by going to `Window > Organizer > Projects`, select your project, and click `Delete` next to Derived Data.

3. **Update your Swift version**: If you're using an older version of Swift, you might be encountering this error because Xcode 10 doesn't support it. You can check your Swift version by going to `File > Swift > Swift Compiler - Language > Swift Language Version`. If you're using an older version, try updating to a newer one.

4. **Check your Podfile**: Make sure that all the pods in your Podfile are compatible with your version of Swift and Xcode. If any of them aren't, you might need to update them or find alternatives.

5. **Reinstall CocoaPods**: Sometimes, the problem might be with CocoaPods itself. Try uninstalling and reinstalling CocoaPods to see if that fixes the issue.

If none of these solutions work, you might need to look more closely at the specific error messages you're getting. They might give you a clue as to what's causing the problem.
