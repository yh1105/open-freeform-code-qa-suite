It seems like you want to move the "Stop Game" button to the top of the game frame, aligning it with the "Begin Game" button. Here are a few suggestions:

1. **HTML Layout:** You can move the "Stop Game" button to the same div as the "Begin Game" button. This will ensure that they are in the same container and hence, can be aligned easily.

2. **CSS Flexbox:** You can use CSS Flexbox to align the buttons. Set the container div to `display: flex;` and use `align-items: center;` to align the buttons vertically. You can also use `justify-content: space-between;` to create equal space between the buttons.

3. **CSS Grid:** Similar to Flexbox, you can use CSS Grid to create a grid layout and place the buttons in the desired positions.

4. **CSS Positioning:** You can use CSS positioning properties like `position: absolute;` or `position: relative;` to position the "Stop Game" button. However, this method requires more careful planning as it can disrupt the layout of other elements.

5. **Bootstrap:** If you are using Bootstrap, you can use its grid system or utility classes to align the buttons.

Remember to adjust the `z-index` property if the button is still behind other elements. Higher values will bring the element to the front.

Without the CSS, it's hard to provide a more specific solution. But these are some general methods you can try.
