Your installation of JDK 11 seems to be correct. The JDK 11 package includes JRE so you won't see a separate JRE folder for JDK 11, which is expected.

The issue seems to be with IntelliJ IDEA 2017. It does not fully support Java 11. You need IntelliJ IDEA 2018.2 or later to have full support for Java 11.

Here are the steps to configure IntelliJ IDEA for Java 11:

1. First, make sure you have the correct version of IntelliJ IDEA (2018.2 or later).

2. Go to `File > Project Structure > Project`.

3. In the `Project SDK` section, click `New > JDK`.

4. Navigate to the location where you installed JDK 11, select the JDK 11 directory and click `OK`.

5. In the `Project language level` field, select `11 - Local variable syntax for lambda parameters`.

6. Click `OK`.

7. Go to `File > Settings > Build, Execution, Deployment > Compiler > Java Compiler`.

8. In the `Target bytecode version` section, make sure all your modules are set to 11.

9. Click `OK`.

Now, you should be able to build your application with Java 11.
