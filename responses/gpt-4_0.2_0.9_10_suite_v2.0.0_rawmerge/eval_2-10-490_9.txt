Yes, there is a better way to do this in Rust. You can use the `?` operator to make the code cleaner and more readable. The `?` operator is used for error propagation. When used in a function that returns `Result` or `Option`, it will return early if the function it is called on returns `None` or `Err`.

Here is how you can refactor your code:

```rust
let i = func1().ok_or_else(|| println!("func 1 returned None"))?;
let j = func2(i).ok_or_else(|| println!("func 2 returned None"))?;
let k = func3(j).ok_or_else(|| println!("func 3 returned None"))?;
let result = func4(k).ok_or_else(|| println!("func 4 returned None"))?;

// Do something with result
```

This code will do the same thing as your original code, but it's much cleaner and easier to read. Each function is called in order, and if any function returns `None`, the error message will be printed and the function will return early.

Note: This will only work if the function you're in returns `Option` or `Result`. If it doesn't, you might need to change the function signature or use a different approach.
