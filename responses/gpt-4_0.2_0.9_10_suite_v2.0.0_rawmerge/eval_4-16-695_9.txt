The Docker build output on macOS is different from Linux due to the way Docker works on macOS. Docker runs natively on Linux, but on macOS, it runs in a virtual machine. This difference can cause some changes in the behavior of Docker, including the build output.

The `--progress=plain` option is used to disable the build output's interactive mode, which is not what you want. It will not show more detailed output.

If you want to see the full output of a command in a Dockerfile, you can use the `RUN` instruction with the `-x` option in a shell command. This option will print each command that will be executed before it is actually executed. Here is an example:

```dockerfile
RUN set -x ; ls -la
```

This will print the `ls -la` command before it is executed, and then print its output.

If you want to see the full output of the Docker build process, including all the steps Docker is taking during the build, you can use the `--debug` option with the `docker` command:

```bash
docker --debug build .
```

This will print a lot of debug information, so it might be a bit overwhelming, but it will definitely show you everything Docker is doing during the build.
