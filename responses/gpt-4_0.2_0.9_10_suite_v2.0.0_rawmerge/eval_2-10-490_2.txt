Yes, there is a better way to do this in Rust using the `?` operator. The `?` operator is used for error propagation. When used with `Option<T>`, it will either return the value inside the `Some` variant or immediately return `None` from the current function.

Here's how you can refactor your code:

```rust
fn main() {
    match do_something() {
        Some(result) => {
            // Do something with result
        },
        None => println!("A function returned None"),
    }
}

fn do_something() -> Option<ReturnType> {
    let i = func1()?;
    let j = func2(i)?;
    let k = func3(j)?;
    let result = func4(k)?;
    Some(result)
}
```

In this refactored version, `do_something` is a new function that chains the calls to `func1`, `func2`, `func3`, and `func4`. If any of these functions return `None`, the `?` operator will immediately return `None` from `do_something`. If all functions return `Some`, `do_something` will return `Some(result)`.

Please replace `ReturnType` with the actual type of the result.

This version is much cleaner and easier to read. However, it does not print which function returned `None`. If you need to know which function returned `None`, you might want to consider using `Result<T, E>` instead of `Option<T>`, where `E` is an error type that indicates which function failed.
