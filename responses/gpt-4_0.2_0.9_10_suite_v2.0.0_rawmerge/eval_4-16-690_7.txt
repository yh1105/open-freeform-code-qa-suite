The issue you're experiencing might be due to the fact that macOS Catalina 10.15 has switched the default shell from Bash to Zsh. 

If you're using the default shell (Zsh), the `~/.bash_profile` and `~/.profile` files won't be sourced. Instead, Zsh uses the `~/.zshrc` file for this purpose.

To set the environment variable for Zsh, you can add the export line to the `~/.zshrc` file:

```bash
echo 'export JBOSS_HOME=/Users/{USERNAME}/Desktop/jboss7' >> ~/.zshrc
```

Then, source the `~/.zshrc` file to apply the changes:

```bash
source ~/.zshrc
```

Now, if you execute `echo $JBOSS_HOME`, you should see the path you set.

If you want to continue using Bash instead of Zsh, you can change your default shell back to Bash by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
chsh -s /bin/bash
```

Afterward, the `~/.bash_profile` and `~/.profile` files should be sourced as expected when you open a new terminal session.
