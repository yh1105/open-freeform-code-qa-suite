The error you're seeing is likely because ESLint is trying to find your `tsconfig.json` file in the root directory of your project, but it's not there. 

In your `.eslintrc.js` file, you've specified the `project` option under `parserOptions` as `"tsconfig.json"`. This tells ESLint to look for the `tsconfig.json` file in the root directory of your project. 

If your `tsconfig.json` file is not in the root directory, you'll need to provide the correct path to it. For example, if your `tsconfig.json` file is in a `config` directory, you would change the `project` option to `"config/tsconfig.json"`.

Here's how you can do it:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  // ...
  parserOptions: {
    project: "./path/to/your/tsconfig.json", // replace with your actual path
    sourceType: "module",
  },
  // ...
};
```

Replace `"./path/to/your/tsconfig.json"` with the actual path to your `tsconfig.json` file.

After making this change, save your `.eslintrc.js` file and restart your editor. If the path is correct, the error should be resolved.
