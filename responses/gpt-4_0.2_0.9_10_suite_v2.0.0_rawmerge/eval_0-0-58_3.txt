The `EINTEGRITY` error is related to the integrity checksum of the package you are trying to install. This error occurs when the `sha512` checksum of the package you downloaded does not match the `sha512` checksum expected by npm. This could be due to a variety of reasons, such as a faulty network connection or a problem with the npm cache.

Here are some possible solutions to resolve this issue:

1. **Clear the npm cache**: The npm cache might be corrupt. You can clear it using the command `npm cache clean --force`. After running this command, try installing the package again.

2. **Delete the `node_modules` directory and `package-lock.json` file**: Sometimes, the `node_modules` directory or the `package-lock.json` file might be causing the issue. Delete both and then run `npm install` again.

3. **Check your network connection**: A faulty network connection might cause the downloaded package to be corrupt. If possible, try a different network connection and then run `npm install` again.

4. **Update npm**: The issue might be with the version of npm you are using. Try updating npm to the latest version using the command `npm install -g npm@latest`.

5. **Use `--no-shrinkwrap` option**: If none of the above solutions work, you can try installing the package with the `--no-shrinkwrap` option. This option will ignore the `npm-shrinkwrap.json` file if it exists in the package. The command would be `npm install --no-shrinkwrap`.

Remember to always backup your project before making any changes.
