Sure, here is a function that will return the size of each tensor in the list:

```python
def getSize(t):
    sizes = [tensor.size() for tensor in t]
    return sizes
```

This function uses a list comprehension to iterate over each tensor in the list `t`, calling the `.size()` method on each tensor to get its size. The sizes are stored in a new list, which is then returned by the function.

You can use this function like this:

```python
sizes = getSize(list_of_tensors)
print(sizes)
```

This will print a list of the sizes of each tensor in the list `list_of_tensors`. Each size will be a tuple, where the first element is the number of rows in the tensor and the second element is the number of columns.
