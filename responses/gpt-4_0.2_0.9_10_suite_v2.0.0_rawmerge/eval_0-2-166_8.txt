Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework. It doesn't provide a direct way to target child elements like you would do in CSS with the `>` operator. 

Tailwind CSS is more about adding utility classes directly to the HTML elements you want to style, rather than defining selectors and rulesets in a separate stylesheet.

So, if you want to style direct children of a div with a class "section", you would need to add the necessary Tailwind classes directly to those child div elements in your HTML.

For example:

```html
<div class="section">
  <div class="bg-red-500 ..."> <!-- Tailwind classes here -->
    <!-- Content -->
  </div>
  <div class="text-xl ..."> <!-- Tailwind classes here -->
    <!-- Content -->
  </div>
</div>
```

In this example, `bg-red-500` and `text-xl` are Tailwind utility classes added directly to the child divs.
