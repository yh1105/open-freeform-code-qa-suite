Your code seems correct and should work as expected. However, there are a few things you can check if you're experiencing issues:

1. **Network Connection:** Make sure your device or emulator has a proper internet connection. Apollo Client fetches data over the network, so a lack of connectivity could cause the loading state to persist indefinitely.

2. **Server Status:** Check if the server at 'https://48p1r2roz4.sse.codesandbox.io' is up and running. You can do this by pasting the URL into your web browser and seeing if it loads. If the server is down, Apollo Client won't be able to fetch any data.

3. **Correct GraphQL Query:** Ensure that your GraphQL query is correct and the server supports it. You can test your query using a GraphQL client like GraphiQL or Apollo Studio.

4. **Apollo Client Version:** There might be compatibility issues with the version of Apollo Client you're using. Try downgrading to a lower version (e.g., "@apollo/client": "^3.3.21") and see if the issue persists.

5. **React Native Version:** There might be compatibility issues with the version of React Native you're using. Try downgrading to a lower version (e.g., "react-native": "0.64.2") and see if the issue persists.

6. **Error Handling:** Add a `console.log(error)` in your error handling code to see if there are any errors being thrown that you're not aware of.

If none of these suggestions work, it might be helpful to create a minimal reproduction of your issue and post it on the Apollo Client GitHub issues page. The maintainers and community can then help you diagnose and fix the issue.
