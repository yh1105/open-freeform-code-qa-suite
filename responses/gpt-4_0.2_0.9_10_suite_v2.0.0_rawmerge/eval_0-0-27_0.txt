Your code seems correct and should work as expected. However, there are a few things you can check if you're having trouble fetching data with Apollo Client:

1. **Check your network connection**: Make sure your device or emulator has a working internet connection. You can test this by trying to fetch data from another API or loading a webpage.

2. **Check the server**: Make sure the GraphQL server at 'https://48p1r2roz4.sse.codesandbox.io' is up and running. You can test this by visiting the URL in a web browser or using a tool like Postman to send a request.

3. **Check the query**: Make sure the query `EXCHANGE_RATES` is correct and the server is able to respond to it. You can test this by running the query directly on the server if it has a GraphQL playground or similar tool.

4. **Check the Apollo Client setup**: Make sure the Apollo Client is correctly set up. The `uri` and `cache` options seem to be correct, but there might be other options required by the server, like `headers` for authentication.

5. **Check the error**: If there's an error, it should be logged to the console. You said `error` is `undefined`, but it might be worth checking again or adding more detailed logging.

6. **Check the React Native environment**: Sometimes, the React Native environment can cause issues. Try resetting the cache with `npx react-native start --reset-cache` or reinstalling the app on your device or emulator.

If none of these steps help, it might be a more complex issue that requires debugging the Apollo Client or server code.
