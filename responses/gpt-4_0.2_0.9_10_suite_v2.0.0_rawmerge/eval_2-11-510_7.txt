The error message "error: ‘std::filesystem’ has not been declared" is due to the fact that the `std::filesystem` namespace is not available in the `<experimental/filesystem>` library. 

In C++17, the filesystem library was still experimental and was available under the `std::experimental::filesystem` namespace. In C++20, it was moved to the `std` namespace.

To fix this error, you should replace `std::filesystem` with `std::experimental::filesystem`. Here is the corrected code:

```c++
#include <experimental/filesystem>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

namespace fs = std::experimental::filesystem;

int main(int argc, char** argv)
{
    std::string imageDirectory = "./image";
    std::vector<std::string> imagePath;
    for (const auto& entry: fs::directory_iterator(imageDirectory))
    {
        imagePath.push_back(entry.path());
        std::cout << entry.path() << std::endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
```

In the above code, I've created a namespace alias `fs` for `std::experimental::filesystem` to make the code more readable. 

Also, don't forget to link the filesystem library when compiling your code. If you're using g++, you can do this by adding `-lstdc++fs` to your g++ command:

```bash
g++ -std=c++17 main.cpp -lstdc++fs
```

If you're using a modern compiler that supports C++20, you should use `<filesystem>` instead of `<experimental/filesystem>` and `std::filesystem` instead of `std::experimental::filesystem`.
