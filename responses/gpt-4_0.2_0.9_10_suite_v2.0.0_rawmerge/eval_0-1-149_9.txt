Sure, you can achieve this by using Tailwind CSS's `group-hover` utility to apply styles on hover. Here's how you can modify your code:

```html
<a href="#" class="group">
    <span class="text-sky-600 transition duration-300 group-hover:underline">Link</span>
    <span class="block h-0.5 bg-sky-600 transform scale-x-0 group-hover:scale-x-100 transition-transform duration-500"></span>
</a>
```

In this code, the `group-hover:underline` utility applies an underline to the text when the parent with the `group` class is hovered over. The `transform scale-x-0 group-hover:scale-x-100 transition-transform duration-500` utilities are used to animate the underline. The underline starts with a scale of 0 (not visible) and scales to 100 (fully visible) when the link is hovered over.

Please note that you need to enable the `group-hover` variant for `scale` and `transform` in your Tailwind CSS configuration file (`tailwind.config.js`) if it's not already enabled:

```js
module.exports = {
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  variants: {
    extend: {
      scale: ['group-hover'],
      transform: ['group-hover'],
    },
  },
  plugins: [],
}
```

Also, make sure you have the `@tailwindcss/forms` plugin installed and included in your Tailwind CSS configuration file.
