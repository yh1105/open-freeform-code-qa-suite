The error message is telling you that Vue.js expects a primitive value (string or number) as a key for each item in a list. This is used for Vue's diffing algorithm for efficient re-rendering.

In your case, you're using the entire `comment` object as a key:

```html
<div v-for="comment in comments" :key="comment">
```

This is not recommended because objects are non-primitive values. Instead, you should use a unique identifier from each `comment` object. If your `comment` objects have a unique `id` field, you can use that:

```html
<div v-for="comment in comments" :key="comment.id">
```

If there's no `id` field, you can use the index of the loop:

```html
<div v-for="(comment, index) in comments" :key="index">
```

Remember, the key should be unique among its sibling elements.
