Sure, you can use the `keydown` event to listen for the "enter" key. Here's how you can modify your code:

```javascript
mounted() {
  let editor = new Editor({
    extensions: [
      StarterKit,
      Keymap({
        "Enter": ({ state, dispatch }) => {
          console.log("good");
          // prevent the default "Enter" behavior
          return true;
        }
      })
    ],
    content: this.value
  });
  this.editor = editor;
}
```

In this code, we're using the `Keymap` extension to listen for the "Enter" key. When the "Enter" key is pressed, it logs "good" to the console and prevents the default "Enter" behavior.

Please note that you need to import `Keymap` from `tiptap-extensions`:

```javascript
import { Keymap } from 'tiptap-extensions'
```

This is a simple example and you might want to add more logic to handle the "Enter" key event according to your needs.
