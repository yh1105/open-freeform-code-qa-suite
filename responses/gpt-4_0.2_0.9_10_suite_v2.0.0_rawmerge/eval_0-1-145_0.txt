The `truncate` class in TailwindCSS only works for single line text. If you want to truncate text that spans multiple lines, you'll need to use some additional CSS. 

Unfortunately, TailwindCSS does not support multi-line text truncation out of the box. However, you can add custom CSS to achieve this.

Here is an example:

```css
.truncate-2-lines {
  display: -webkit-box;
  -webkit-line-clamp: 2;
  -webkit-box-orient: vertical;  
  overflow: hidden;
}
```

Then, you can use this class in your HTML:

```html
<div className="ml-1 inline-block">
   <span>Label: </span>
   <span className="font-semibold truncate-2-lines">
     long texttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttt
   </span>
</div>
```

This will truncate the text after two lines. You can adjust the number in `-webkit-line-clamp` to change the number of lines before truncation.

Please note that this solution uses webkit prefixes and may not work in all browsers. It is not supported in IE and some older versions of Firefox.
