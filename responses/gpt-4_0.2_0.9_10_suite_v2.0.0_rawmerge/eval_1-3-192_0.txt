Here is a Python function that solves the problem:

```python
def to_camel_case(text):
    if not text:
        return ''
    else:
        words = text.replace('-', ' ').replace('_', ' ').split()
        return words[0] + ''.join(word.title() for word in words[1:])
```

This function works by first checking if the input string is empty. If it is, it returns an empty string. If it's not, it replaces all dashes and underscores with spaces, then splits the string into a list of words. It then returns a string that consists of the first word in the list (which is left as is) followed by the rest of the words with their first letter capitalized.

Here's how you can test this function:

```python
print(to_camel_case(''))  # should return ''
print(to_camel_case("the_stealth_warrior"))  # should return "theStealthWarrior"
print(to_camel_case("The-Stealth-Warrior"))  # should return "TheStealthWarrior"
print(to_camel_case("A-B-C"))  # should return "ABC"
```
