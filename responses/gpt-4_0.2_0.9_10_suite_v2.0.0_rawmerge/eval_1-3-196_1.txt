Unfortunately, `conda` does not provide a built-in command to directly list the sizes of installed packages. However, you can use a workaround to achieve this. 

You can find the size of the packages in the `pkgs` directory of your Anaconda installation. On Windows, this is typically located at `C:\Users\YourUsername\Anaconda3\pkgs`.

You can use the `du` command in Unix-based systems to check the size of each directory (which corresponds to a package). Since you're using Windows, you can use PowerShell to achieve the same result.

Here is a PowerShell command that will list the sizes of the directories in the `pkgs` directory:

```powershell
Get-ChildItem 'C:\Users\YourUsername\Anaconda3\pkgs' | ForEach-Object { 
    $size = (Get-ChildItem $_.FullName -Recurse | Measure-Object -Property Length -Sum).Sum / 1MB
    [PSCustomObject]@{
        Name = $_.Name
        Size = "{0:N2} MB" -f $size
    }
} | Sort-Object {[double]($_.Size -replace ' MB', '')} -Descending
```

Replace `'C:\Users\YourUsername\Anaconda3\pkgs'` with the actual path to your `pkgs` directory. This command will list all the packages along with their sizes in descending order.

Please note that this will give you the size of the package files on disk, not the amount of memory they use when loaded.
