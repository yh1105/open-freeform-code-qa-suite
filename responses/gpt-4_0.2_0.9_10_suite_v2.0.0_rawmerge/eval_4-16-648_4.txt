This error message indicates that the root directory `/` is read-only on your system. This is the default behavior on macOS Catalina and later versions due to a security feature called [System Integrity Protection (SIP)](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204899).

To resolve this issue, you can create the directory under your home directory or any other location where you have write permissions. For example:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/data/db
```

If you specifically need the directory to be at `/data/db`, you can disable SIP, but this is generally not recommended because it can make your system more vulnerable to malicious software. 

If you're trying to set up MongoDB, you can specify a different dbpath that is not in the root directory. For example:

```bash
mongod --dbpath ~/data/db
```

This command tells MongoDB to use `~/data/db` as the data directory.
