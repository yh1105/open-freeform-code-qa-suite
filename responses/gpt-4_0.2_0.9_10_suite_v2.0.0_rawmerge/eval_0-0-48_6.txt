Sure, the issue with your code is that you're trying to use the same key for two different types of properties. TypeScript doesn't allow this. Instead, you can create a new type that combines both of these types. Here is the correct way to define `FruitsAndColors`:

```typescript
type FruitsAndColors = {
  [K in fruit]: number;
} & {
  [K in color]: boolean;
}
```

This will create a type that has a numeric property for each fruit and a boolean property for each color.
