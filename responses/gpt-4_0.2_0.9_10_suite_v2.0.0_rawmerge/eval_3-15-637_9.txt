The error you're experiencing could be due to a number of reasons. Here are a few things you could try:

1. **Check your SeleniumBasic version**: Make sure you have the latest version of SeleniumBasic installed. You can download it from [here](https://github.com/florentbr/SeleniumBasic/releases).

2. **Check your browser driver**: Ensure that the browser driver (e.g., ChromeDriver for Google Chrome, GeckoDriver for Firefox, etc.) is up-to-date and compatible with the version of the browser you're using. You can download the latest drivers from the Selenium [website](https://www.selenium.dev/downloads/).

3. **Check your Internet Explorer settings**: If you're using Internet Explorer, you need to set the "Enable Protected Mode" option to the same value (either checked or unchecked) for all zones. To do this, go to Internet Options > Security.

4. **Check your references in VBA**: Go to VBA Editor > Tools > References and make sure that Selenium Type Library is checked.

5. **Try using a different browser**: If you're still having issues, try using a different browser to see if the problem persists. Here's an example of how to use Chrome:

```vba
Dim driver As New WebDriver
driver.Start "chrome", "https://www.google.com/"
driver.Window.Maximize
```

6. **Try using early binding**: Instead of using `Dim driver As New WebDriver`, try using early binding:

```vba
Dim driver As Selenium.WebDriver
Set driver = New Selenium.WebDriver
driver.Start "ie"
driver.Window.Maximize
driver.Get "https://www.google.com/"
```
