Sure, you can achieve this by using a wildcard and then parse the parameters manually. Here is the route pattern:

```javascript
/route/:param1/config/:optionalParams*
```

This pattern will match all of the following routes:

- `route/aa/config`
- `route/aa/config/bb`
- `route/aa/config/bb/cc`

In your route handler, you can then split the `optionalParams` by `/` to get the individual parameters.
