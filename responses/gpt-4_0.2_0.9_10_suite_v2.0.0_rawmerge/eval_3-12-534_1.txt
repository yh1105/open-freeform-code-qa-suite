You can use `MultiProvider` to provide multiple providers to your widget tree. However, if you want to consume multiple providers in a single widget, you can nest `Consumer` widgets. Here is an example:

```dart
Consumer<Provider1>(
  builder: (context, provider1, child) {
    return Consumer<Provider2>(
      builder: (context, provider2, child) {
        return Consumer<Provider3>(
          builder: (context, provider3, child) {
            return Consumer<Provider4>(
              builder: (context, provider4, child) {
                // Now you can use provider1, provider2, provider3, and provider4
                return CurvedNavigationBar(
                  // Your implementation here
                );
              },
            );
          },
        );
      },
    );
  },
);
```

In this example, `Provider1`, `Provider2`, `Provider3`, and `Provider4` are the classes that extend `ChangeNotifier`. You can replace them with your actual class names.

This way, you can consume multiple providers in a single widget. However, keep in mind that this can lead to deeply nested code. If you find yourself needing to consume many providers in a single widget frequently, you might want to consider restructuring your state management to reduce complexity.
