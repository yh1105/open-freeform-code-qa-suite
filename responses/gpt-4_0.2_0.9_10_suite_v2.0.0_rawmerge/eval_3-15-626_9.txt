Your code is almost correct, but you need to define your variables and use `Set` to assign objects to them. Also, you need to use the actual query text, not just the name of the query. Here's a corrected version of your code:

```vba
Sub LoadToWorksheetOnly()

    Dim query As String
    Dim currentSheet As Worksheet

    ' Get the query text from Sheet6
    query = Sheets("Sheet6").Range("A1").Value

    ' Get the current active sheet
    Set currentSheet = ActiveSheet

    ' Create a QueryTable with the Power Query connection string
    With currentSheet.ListObjects.Add(SourceType:=0, Source:= _
        "OLEDB;Provider=Microsoft.Mashup.OleDb.1;Data Source=$Workbook$;Location=" & query _
        , Destination:=Sheets("target").Range("$A$1")).QueryTable
        .CommandType = xlCmdDefault
        .CommandText = Array("SELECT * FROM [" & query & "]")
        .RowNumbers = False
        .FillAdjacentFormulas = False
        .PreserveFormatting = True
        .RefreshOnFileOpen = False
        .BackgroundQuery = True
        .RefreshStyle = xlInsertDeleteCells
        .SavePassword = False
        .SaveData = True
        .AdjustColumnWidth = True
        .RefreshPeriod = 0
        .PreserveColumnInfo = False
        .Refresh BackgroundQuery:=False
    End With

End Sub
```

Please note that this code assumes that the query text in `Sheet6` cell `A1` is a valid Power Query M expression. If it's not, you'll need to adjust the code accordingly.
