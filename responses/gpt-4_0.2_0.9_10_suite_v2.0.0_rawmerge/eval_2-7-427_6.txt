## CSRF Token Mismatch

The CSRF token mismatch error could be due to a number of reasons. Here are a few things you can check:

1. **Domain Configuration**: Ensure that your domain is correctly configured to point to the public directory of your Laravel application. Incorrect configuration could lead to issues with session management.

2. **Session Configuration**: Check your session configuration in `config/session.php`. Ensure that the `domain` and `path` options are correctly set. If your application is in a subdirectory or a subdomain, you need to specify it in the `path` and `domain` options respectively.

3. **Cookie Configuration**: Check your cookie configuration in `config/session.php`. Ensure that the `secure` option is set to `true` if your application is served over HTTPS, and `false` if it's served over HTTP.

4. **Middleware**: Ensure that the `VerifyCsrfToken` middleware is included in the `web` middleware group in your `app/Http/Kernel.php` file.

5. **Cache**: Try clearing your application cache using the `php artisan cache:clear` and `php artisan config:clear` commands.

## SMTP Connection Error

The error you're getting indicates that there's a problem with the SSL configuration of your SMTP server. Here are a few things you can try:

1. **Encryption Type**: Try changing the `MAIL_ENCRYPTION` value in your `.env` file from `ssl` to `tls`.

2. **Port Number**: The port number you're using (587) is typically used with `tls` encryption. If your mail server requires `ssl` encryption, you might need to use port 465 instead.

3. **Server Configuration**: Check with your client if there are any specific configuration requirements for their SMTP server. They might require a specific encryption type or port number.

4. **Firewall or Security Software**: Ensure that your server's firewall or any security software isn't blocking the connection to the SMTP server.

5. **Mail Server Availability**: Check if the mail server is up and running. You can do this by using the `ping` command or by trying to connect to the server using a mail client.
