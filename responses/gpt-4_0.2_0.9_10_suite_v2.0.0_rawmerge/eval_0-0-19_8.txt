The error message indicates that the package `aws-sdk-js` was not found in the npm registry. This is likely because the package does not exist or has been renamed.

If you're trying to install the AWS SDK for JavaScript, the correct package name is `aws-sdk`, not `aws-sdk-js`. You can install it using the following command:

```bash
npm install aws-sdk
```

This should resolve the issue. If you still encounter problems, make sure your network connection is stable and that the npm registry is accessible from your network.
