The error message "Module not found: Can't resolve 'popper.js'" usually means that the `popper.js` library, which is a dependency for Bootstrap, is not installed in your project.

You can install it using npm (Node Package Manager) or yarn. Here's how you can do it:

**Using npm:**

```bash
npm install popper.js --save
```

**Using yarn:**

```bash
yarn add popper.js
```

After installing `popper.js`, you should import it in your file before importing Bootstrap.

```javascript
import Popper from 'popper.js';
import 'bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min';
```

If you're using Bootstrap 4, you can import the bundle file which includes `popper.js`.

```javascript
import 'bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle';
```

This should resolve the error. If the error persists, make sure that the path to the `popper.js` module is correct and that the module is properly installed in your `node_modules` directory.
