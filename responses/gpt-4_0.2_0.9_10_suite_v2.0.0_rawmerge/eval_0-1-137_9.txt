The error you're getting is because you're trying to import the Bootstrap variables before you define your own. The `!default` flag in SASS means that the variable should only be assigned if it hasn't been assigned yet. So, you should define your variables before importing the Bootstrap variables.

Here's how you can do it:

```scss
// Define your own colors
$theme-colors: (
  "primary": #your-color,
  // Add other colors if needed
);

// Then import the Bootstrap variables and Bootstrap
@import "../../node_modules/bootstrap/scss/bootstrap";
```

Replace `#your-color` with the color you want to use. If you want to change other colors, just add them to the `$theme-colors` map.

Also, make sure you're using Dart Sass as LibSass (which includes Node Sass) is deprecated. Bootstrap v5 recommends Dart Sass. You can install it with npm:

```bash
npm install -D sass
```

And then compile your SCSS file:

```bash
npx sass your-file.scss output.css
```

Replace `your-file.scss` with the path to your SCSS file and `output.css` with the path where you want the compiled CSS file to be saved.
