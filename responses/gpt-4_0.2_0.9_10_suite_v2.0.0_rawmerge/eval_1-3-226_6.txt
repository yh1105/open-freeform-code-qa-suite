Here is a Python function that should do what you want:

```python
def splitOne(s):
    split_string = s.split('_', 1)
    if len(split_string) > 1:
        return split_string[1]
    else:
        return split_string[0]
```

This function splits the input string `s` at the first occurrence of `_`. If the split results in more than one element, it returns the second element (everything after the first `_`). If the split results in only one element (meaning there was no `_` in the string), it returns that element.
