This error is likely due to a version mismatch between Devise and Rails. Devise 4.8.0 is not compatible with Rails versions below 6.1. 

Here are a few steps to resolve this issue:

1. If you're using Rails 6.1 or above, ensure that you're using the latest version of Devise. You can do this by updating your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'devise', '~> 4.8.0'
```

Then run `bundle update devise` in your terminal.

2. If you're using a version of Rails below 6.1, you should use a compatible version of Devise. For Rails 6.0, Devise 4.7.3 is the latest compatible version. Update your Gemfile like so:

```ruby
gem 'devise', '~> 4.7.3'
```

Then run `bundle update devise` in your terminal.

Remember to restart your Rails server after making these changes. If you're still encountering issues, it may be helpful to check the [Devise GitHub page](https://github.com/heartcombo/devise) for any known issues or additional troubleshooting steps.
