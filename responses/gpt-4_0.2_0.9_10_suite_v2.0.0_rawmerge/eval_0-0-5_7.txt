The error log indicates that the Python executable cannot be found in your PATH. Node-gyp, which is a cross-platform command-line tool written in Node.js for compiling native addon modules for Node.js, requires Python to work.

Here are the steps to fix this issue:

1. **Install Python**: If Python is not installed on your machine, you need to install it. You can download Python from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Node-gyp requires Python 2.7, so make sure to install that version. Python 3.x is not supported.

2. **Add Python to the PATH**: After installing Python, you need to add it to your system's PATH. Here's how to do it:

   - Open the System Properties (Right click Computer in the start menu, or use the keyboard shortcut Win+Pause)
   - Click Advanced system settings in the sidebar.
   - Click Environment Variables...
   - Select PATH in the System variables section
   - Click Edit
   - Add Python's path to the end of the list (the paths are separated by semicolons). For example, if you installed Python to `C:\Python27\`, then you would add `C:\Python27\` to the end of the PATH.

3. **Reinstall node-gyp**: After Python is installed and added to the PATH, you should reinstall node-gyp. You can do this by running `npm install -g node-gyp` in your command line.

4. **Rebuild node-sass**: Finally, you need to rebuild node-sass by running `npm rebuild node-sass` in your command line.

After following these steps, your build should work. If you still encounter issues, please let me know.
