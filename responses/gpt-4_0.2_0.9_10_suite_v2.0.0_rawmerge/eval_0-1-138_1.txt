Yes, you can detect if the user's system is in dark mode by using the CSS media feature `prefers-color-scheme`. This feature is used to detect if the user has requested the system to use a light or dark color theme.

Here is an example of how you can use it:

```css
/* Light mode */
@media (prefers-color-scheme: light) {
  body {
    background-color: white;
    color: black;
  }
}

/* Dark mode */
@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
  body {
    background-color: black;
    color: white;
  }
}
```

In this example, the background color of the body will be white and the text color will be black when the user's system is in light mode. When the user's system is in dark mode, the background color of the body will be black and the text color will be white.

This feature is supported in Safari 12.1, Firefox 67, and Chrome 76 and later versions.

Please note that the `prefers-color-scheme` media feature respects the user's system setting, so it will only work if the user has chosen a specific color scheme in their system settings.
