This error can be caused by a variety of issues, but here are a few potential solutions that you can try:

1. **Clean the project and derived data**

   Sometimes, Xcode can get confused with old cache data. You can clean your project by going to `Product -> Clean Build Folder`. Also, you can delete derived data by going to `Window -> Organizer -> Select your project -> Delete Derived Data`.

2. **Check your Swift version**

   Ensure that all your Pods are compatible with the Swift version you are using. You can check this by going to `Pods -> Build Settings -> Swift Language Version`.

3. **Update CocoaPods**

   Make sure you are using the latest version of CocoaPods. You can update CocoaPods by running `sudo gem install cocoapods` in your terminal.

4. **Reinstall Pods**

   Try deleting the `Podfile.lock` file and the `Pods` folder and then reinstall the pods by running `pod install`.

5. **Check your code**

   The error could be due to some code that is not compatible with the new Swift version. Check the error details to see if it points to a specific line of code.

6. **Disable parallel builds**

   In some cases, disabling parallel builds can solve this issue. You can do this by going to `File -> Project/Workspace Settings -> Build System -> Legacy Build System`.

Remember to always backup your project before making any changes. If none of these solutions work, you might want to consider downgrading to a previous version of Xcode until the issue is resolved.
