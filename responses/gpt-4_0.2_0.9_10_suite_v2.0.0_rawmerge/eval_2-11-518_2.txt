The Rule of Five is not outdated, but its usage has been reduced due to the introduction of smart pointers and other features in modern C++. 

You're correct that many resource-managing classes can be converted into aggregate data structures using smart pointers. This is a good practice because it reduces the chance of resource leaks and makes the code easier to understand and maintain. 

However, there are still cases where you might need to define these special member functions:

1. **Performance**: Sometimes, for performance reasons, you might want to manage memory directly. For example, you might want to implement a custom allocator for a class that does a lot of dynamic memory allocation.

2. **Legacy Code**: If you're working with legacy code that doesn't use smart pointers, you might need to define these functions.

3. **Custom Behavior**: You might need to define these functions if you want custom behavior. For example, you might want to implement a deep copy for a class that contains raw pointers.

4. **Resource other than Memory**: If your class manages a resource other than memory (like a file or a network connection), you might need to define these functions to properly manage that resource.

5. **Interoperability with C or other languages**: If you're writing code that needs to interoperate with C or other languages, you might need to manage resources manually.

So while the need to define these functions has been reduced, there are still cases where they're necessary. Therefore, the Rule of Five is still relevant.
