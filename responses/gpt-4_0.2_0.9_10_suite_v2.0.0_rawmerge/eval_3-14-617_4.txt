This error can occur due to a variety of reasons. Here are a few things you can try:

1. **Check your build phases scripts:** Go to your target, then to the `Build Phases` tab. Check if there are any scripts that are failing. If there are, try to fix them.

2. **Check your podfile:** Make sure all the pods are installed correctly. You can try to deintegrate and then reinstall the pods using the following commands:

    ```bash
    pod deintegrate
    pod install
    ```

3. **Check your signing certificates:** Make sure you have the correct signing certificates and provisioning profiles. You can also try to regenerate them if necessary.

4. **Check your Swift version:** Make sure you are using the correct Swift version for your libraries. For example, `IQKeyboardManagerSwift` requires Swift 4.2 or later.

5. **Clean your project:** Try to clean your project (Shift + Cmd + K) and then build it again.

6. **Check your Xcode version:** Make sure you are using a compatible Xcode version with your libraries. For example, `IQKeyboardManagerSwift` requires Xcode 10.2 or later.

7. **Check your library versions:** Make sure you are using the correct versions of your libraries. For example, `SDWebImage` requires version 4.0 or later.

If none of these solutions work, you may need to provide more information or check the specific error message you are getting.
