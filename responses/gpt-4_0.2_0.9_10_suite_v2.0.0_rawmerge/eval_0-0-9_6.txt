The error you're seeing is because `req.logout()` is being called without a callback function. However, in Passport.js, `req.logout()` does not actually require a callback function. It seems like there might be a conflict with another library or middleware that is also defining a `logout` method on the `req` object.

In your case, you can try to use `req.session.destroy()` instead of `req.logout()`. This will destroy the session, effectively logging the user out. Here's how you can do it:

```javascript
app.get("/logout", (req, res) => {
    req.session.destroy(function(err) {
        if(err) {
            console.log(err);
        } else {
            res.redirect("/");
        }
    });
});
```

This code will destroy the session and then redirect the user to the home page. If there's an error during this process, it will be logged to the console.
