The error message is indicating that you're using a non-primitive value (in this case, an object `comment`) as a key in your `v-for` loop. Vue.js uses the `key` attribute to track each node's identity, so it can reuse and reorder existing elements for efficiency. When you use an object as a key, Vue can't track the nodes properly.

To fix this, you should use a unique primitive value (like a string or a number) as a key. If each comment has a unique id, you can use that as a key:

```html
<div v-for="comment in comments" :key="comment.id">
```

If there's no unique id, you can use the index of the loop:

```html
<div v-for="(comment, index) in comments" :key="index">
```

Remember, it's important to ensure that keys are unique within the component's scope.
