You can use the `border-t` class to apply a border to the top edge only. Here's how you can do it:

```html
<div class="border-t border-blue-900">foo</div>
```

In this code, `border-t` applies a border to the top edge, and `border-blue-900` sets the color of the border. The number `900` in `border-blue-900` is the shade of the color.
