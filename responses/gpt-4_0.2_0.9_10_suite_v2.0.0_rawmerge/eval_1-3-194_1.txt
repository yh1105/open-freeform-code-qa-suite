You can use the `openpyxl` library in Python to write data into an Excel file. Here is the function `writeToExcel`:

```python
from openpyxl import Workbook

def writeExcel():
    new_list = [["first", "second"], ["third", "fourth"]]
    wb = Workbook()
    ws = wb.active
    for i in range(len(new_list)):
        ws.append(new_list[i])
    wb.save("data.xlsx")
```

In this function, we first create a new workbook using `Workbook()`. Then we get the active worksheet using `wb.active`. We then append each list in `new_list` to the worksheet. Finally, we save the workbook as "data.xlsx".

Please make sure to install the `openpyxl` library before running the code. You can install it using pip:

```shell
pip install openpyxl
```
