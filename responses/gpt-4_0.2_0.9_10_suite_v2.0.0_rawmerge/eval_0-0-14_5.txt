Sure, you can use the `onChange` event of the `Switch` component to update the form value. Here is the revised version of your code:

```jsx
<Form.Item name="switch" valuePropName="checked">
  <Switch 
    checkedChildren="Yes" 
    unCheckedChildren="No" 
    onChange={(checked) => {
      form.setFieldsValue({ switch: checked });
    }}
  />
  <span>Chargable</span>
</Form.Item>
```

In this code, the `onChange` event is used to update the form value when the switch is toggled. The `setFieldsValue` method is used to manually set the value of one or more fields.
