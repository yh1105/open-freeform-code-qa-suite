The error you're encountering might be due to a few reasons:

1. **Compatibility Issue**: SeleniumBasic (VBA) might not be fully compatible with Excel 2019. You can check the official documentation or community for any known issues.

2. **Browser Driver**: Ensure that the browser driver (like IEDriverServer for Internet Explorer, chromedriver for Chrome, etc.) is up-to-date and compatible with the browser version you're using.

3. **Reference Problem**: Make sure that the Selenium Type Library is correctly referenced in your VBA project. You can check this by going to `Tools > References` in the VBA editor.

4. **Internet Explorer Issue**: Since you're using Internet Explorer in your code (`driver.Start "ie"`), it's worth noting that IE is being phased out by Microsoft. You might want to switch to Edge or another browser.

Here's an example of how you can use Chrome instead of IE:

```vba
Dim driver As New WebDriver

driver.Start "chrome", "https://www.google.com"
driver.Window.Maximize
```

Remember to have the `chromedriver.exe` in your system path or in the same directory as your workbook.

If none of the above solutions work, you might want to consider using a different automation tool that is more compatible with Excel 2019, like Excel VBA's built-in `Microsoft HTML Object Library` for web scraping, or a more powerful tool like UiPath.
