You can't directly initialize a `@State` variable in the `init()` method. Instead, you can use a workaround by creating a normal variable in the `init()` method and then use that variable to initialize your `@State` variable. Here is how you can do it:

```swift
struct StateFromOutside: View {
    let list = [
        "a": "Letter A",
        "b": "Letter B",
        // ...
    ]
    @State var fullText: String

    init(letter: String) {
        let initialText = list[letter] ?? ""
        _fullText = State(initialValue: initialText)
    }

    var body: some View {
        TextField("Placeholder", text: $fullText)
    }
}
```

In the above code, `initialText` is a normal variable that gets its value from the `list` dictionary. Then, `_fullText` (which is the underlying variable for `@State var fullText`) is initialized with `State(initialValue: initialText)`.
