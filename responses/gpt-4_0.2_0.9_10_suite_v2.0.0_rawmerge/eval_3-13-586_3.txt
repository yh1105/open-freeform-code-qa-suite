The error message you're seeing is due to a change in Android 12 (API level 31) that requires you to specify whether a `PendingIntent` is mutable or immutable when you create it. 

The AndroidX Media library version 1.4.0, which you're using, should handle this requirement. However, it seems like there's an issue with the library itself, as it's not correctly setting the `FLAG_IMMUTABLE` or `FLAG_MUTABLE` when creating the `PendingIntent`.

This issue has been reported to Google and they have fixed it in the `1.4.1` version of the library. So, updating the library to the latest version should resolve the issue.

Update your `build.gradle` file to use the latest version of the library:

```groovy
dependencies {
    implementation 'androidx.media:media:1.4.1'
}
```

After updating the library, clean and rebuild your project. If the problem persists, please let me know.
