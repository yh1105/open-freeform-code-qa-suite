Enzyme does not officially support React 17 yet. However, there is an unofficial adapter available for React 17 called `@wojtekmaj/enzyme-adapter-react-17`. You can use it in your project until the official adapter is released.

First, you need to install it:

```bash
npm install --save @wojtekmaj/enzyme-adapter-react-17
```

Then, you can use it in your code like this:

```javascript
import Enzyme from 'enzyme';
import Adapter from '@wojtekmaj/enzyme-adapter-react-17';

Enzyme.configure({ adapter: new Adapter() });
```

Please note that since this is an unofficial adapter, it may not work perfectly in all cases. If you encounter issues, you might want to consider using the official React testing library, which does support React 17.
