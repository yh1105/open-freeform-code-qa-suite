The `@Binding` property wrapper is used to create a two-way connection between a property that stores data, and a view that displays and changes the data. However, in your case, you're using `@Binding` in a standalone view, which doesn't have a parent view to bind to.

To fix this, you can create a parent view that has a `@State` variable, and pass it as a `@Binding` to the `ContentView`. Here's an example:

```swift
import SwiftUI

struct ParentView: View {
    @State private var isSelected: Bool = false

    var body: some View {
        ContentView(isSelected: $isSelected)
    }
}

struct ContentView: View {
    @Binding var isSelected: Bool

    var body: some View {
        Button(action: {
            self.isSelected.toggle()
        }) {
            Text(isSelected ? "Selected" : "Not Selected")
        }
    }
}

struct ContentView_Previews: PreviewProvider {
    static var previews: some View {
        ParentView()
    }
}
```

In this code, `ParentView` has a `@State` variable `isSelected`, which is passed to `ContentView` as a `@Binding`. When `isSelected` is toggled in `ContentView`, it will also update in `ParentView`, causing the view to refresh.
