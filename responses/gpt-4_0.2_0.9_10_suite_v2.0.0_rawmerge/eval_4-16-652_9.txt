AWS CLI uses a pager program to handle its output. By default, it uses the `less` program. You can disable this behavior by setting the `AWS_PAGER` environment variable to an empty string.

Here is how you can do it:

```bash
export AWS_PAGER=""
```

You can add this line at the beginning of your script to disable the pager for the entire script:

```bash
export AWS_PAGER=""

for x in 1 2 3; do 
  aws sqs purge-queue --queue-url https://sqs.<aws-region>.amazonaws.com/<id>/<env>-$x-<queueName>.fifo; 
done
```

This will prevent the AWS CLI from opening the pager for its output.

If you want to make this change permanent for all your terminal sessions, you can add the `export AWS_PAGER=""` line to your shell profile file (like `~/.bashrc` or `~/.bash_profile` for bash, `~/.zshrc` for zsh).
