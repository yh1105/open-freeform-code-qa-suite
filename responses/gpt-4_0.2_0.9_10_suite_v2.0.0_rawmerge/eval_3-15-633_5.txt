Yes, you can achieve the same result using `INDEX` and `SMALL` functions in combination with `IF` and `ROW` functions. Here's how you can do it:

```excel
=INDEX($B$1:$B$100, SMALL(IF($A$1:$A$100="x", ROW($A$1:$A$100)-ROW(INDEX($A$1:$A$100,1,1))+1), ROW(1:1)))
```

This is an array formula, so you need to press `Ctrl+Shift+Enter` after typing the formula instead of just `Enter`.

This formula will return the first match. To get the next matches, copy the formula down the column.

This formula works by creating an array of row numbers for rows where `Column A` is "x". The `SMALL` function then returns the smallest row number on the first row, the second smallest on the second row, and so on. The `INDEX` function then returns the value from `Column B` for that row number.

If you want to use a VBA Macro, you can use the following code:

```vba
Sub FilterData()
    Dim rng As Range
    Dim outputCol As Range
    Dim cell As Range
    Dim outputRow As Integer

    Set rng = ThisWorkbook.Sheets("Sheet1").Range("A1:A100")
    Set outputCol = ThisWorkbook.Sheets("Sheet1").Range("C1")
    outputRow = 1

    For Each cell In rng
        If cell.Value = "x" Then
            outputCol.Offset(outputRow - 1, 0).Value = cell.Offset(0, 1).Value
            outputRow = outputRow + 1
        End If
    Next cell
End Sub
```

This macro will copy the values from `Column B` to `Column C` if the corresponding value in `Column A` is "x". You can adjust the range and output column as needed.
