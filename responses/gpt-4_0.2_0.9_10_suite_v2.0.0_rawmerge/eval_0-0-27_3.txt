Your code seems fine at first glance. However, there are a few things you might want to check:

1. **Network Connection**: Make sure your device/emulator has access to the internet. Sometimes, the emulator might not be connected to the internet, causing the request to hang indefinitely.

2. **Server Availability**: The server at 'https://48p1r2roz4.sse.codesandbox.io' might be down or not available. Try to access this URL in your web browser to see if it's up and running.

3. **CORS Policy**: If you're running this on a local device, you might be running into CORS issues. The server at 'https://48p1r2roz4.sse.codesandbox.io' needs to allow requests from your origin. This is usually not a problem with React Native, but it's worth checking.

4. **Apollo Client Version**: There might be compatibility issues with the version of Apollo Client you're using. Try downgrading to a lower version (e.g., "@apollo/client": "3.3.21") and see if the problem persists.

5. **Error Handling**: You might be getting an error that you're not handling. Try logging the error to see if there's more information:

```javascript
const { loading, error, data } = useQuery(EXCHANGE_RATES);

if (error) {
    console.error('Error:', error);
    return <Text>Error :(</Text>;
}
```

6. **GraphQL Query**: Make sure your GraphQL query is correct and the server supports it. You can test your query using a GraphQL client like Apollo Studio or GraphQL Playground.

If none of these solutions work, you might want to consider posting an issue in the Apollo Client GitHub repository.
