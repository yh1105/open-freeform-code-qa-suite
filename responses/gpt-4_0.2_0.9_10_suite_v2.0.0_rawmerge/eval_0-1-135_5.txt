Yes, Safari has some issues with flexbox and images. The problem is that Safari doesn't seem to respect the `height: auto` for images inside a flex container. 

To fix this, you can add `align-self: flex-start` to the image. This will align the image at the start of the cross axis, which is the vertical axis in this case, and it will stop the image from stretching.

Here is the updated CSS:

```css
.container {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
}

.container section:first-child {
  display: flex;
  margin-bottom: 25px;
}

.container img {
  width: 125px;
  height: auto;
  align-self: flex-start; /* Add this */
}
```

This should make the image display correctly in Safari.
