The error message indicates that the migration class "20210909072642" was not found. This could be due to the incorrect namespace or the wrong migration version number.

Based on your configuration and the migration class listed, you should be able to execute the migration with the following command:

```bash
bin/console --env=dev doctrine:migrations:execute 'Application\Migrations\Version20210909072642' --down --no-interaction -vvv
```

This command includes the correct namespace (`Application\Migrations`) and the version number (`Version20210909072642`) as listed in your migrations list.

If you still encounter the error, make sure that the migration file `Version20210909072642.php` exists in the directory `app/DoctrineMigrations`. If it doesn't exist, you might need to create a new migration or use a different version number.
