The issue with your code is that it doesn't handle the case when the user denies the location permission. The `navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition()` method takes a second argument which is a function that will be called when an error occurs. You can use this to handle the case when the user denies the location permission.

Here is the corrected code:

```javascript
if (navigator.geolocation) {
    navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(
        position => {
            console.log("Location accessed");
        },
        error => {
            if (error.code == error.PERMISSION_DENIED)
                console.log("User not allowed");
        }
    );
} else {
    console.log("Geolocation is not supported by this browser.");
}
```

In this code, if the user denies the location permission, the error function will be called and "User not allowed" will be logged to the console. If the geolocation is not supported by the browser, "Geolocation is not supported by this browser." will be logged to the console.
