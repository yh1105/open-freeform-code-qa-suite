This issue can be caused by a variety of reasons. Here are a few things you can try to resolve the issue:

1. **Clean the project**: In Xcode, select `Product > Clean Build Folder`. Then try to build the project again.

2. **Delete derived data**: Go to `Window > Organizer > Projects > Your Project > Delete Derived Data`. Then try to build the project again.

3. **Update CocoaPods**: Make sure you are using the latest version of CocoaPods. You can update it by running `sudo gem install cocoapods` in Terminal.

4. **Reinstall Pods**: Delete the `Pods` directory and `Podfile.lock` file in your project directory, then run `pod install` again.

5. **Check Swift version**: Make sure the Swift version in your project settings matches the Swift version of your Pods. You can check this in `Podfile` and `Build Settings > Swift Language Version`.

6. **Disable parallel building**: Go to `Edit Scheme > Build > Build Options > Uncheck Parallelize Build`. This option can sometimes cause issues with building Pods.

7. **Check your code**: The error can also be caused by a problem in your Swift code. Check the error message for more details about where the problem might be.

If none of these solutions work, you might need to create a new project and move your code over, or downgrade to a previous version of Xcode.
