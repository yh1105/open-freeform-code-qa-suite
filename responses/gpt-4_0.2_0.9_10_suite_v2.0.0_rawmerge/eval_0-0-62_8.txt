The error you're seeing is due to the fact that Vue.js requires a unique key for each item in a `v-for` loop. This key should be a primitive value (string or number), not an object or array. 

In your case, `comment` is likely an object, which is causing the error. If your `comment` object has a unique identifier, such as an `id`, you should use that as the key:

```html
<div v-for="comment in comments" :key="comment.id">
```

If there's no unique identifier in the `comment` object, you can use the index of the loop:

```html
<div v-for="(comment, index) in comments" :key="index">
```

Using non-primitive values as keys can lead to unpredictable behavior, so Vue.js warns against it.
