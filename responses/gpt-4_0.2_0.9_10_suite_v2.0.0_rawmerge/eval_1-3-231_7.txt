Sure, you can use the `size()` method provided by PyTorch to get the shape of each tensor in your list. Here is a function that does that:

```python
def getSize(t):
    sizes = [tensor.size() for tensor in t]
    return sizes
```

This function iterates over each tensor in the list `t` and stores its size in the `sizes` list. The `size()` method returns the shape of the tensor as a `torch.Size` object, which is basically a tuple, so the `sizes` list will be a list of tuples.

You can use this function like this:

```python
sizes = getSize(my_list)
print(sizes)
```

This will print the size of each tensor in your list.
