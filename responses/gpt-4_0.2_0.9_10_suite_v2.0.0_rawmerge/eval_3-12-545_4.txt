The error message is telling you that you're trying to send a JSON body (due to the 'Content-Type':'application/json' header) but you're actually sending a Map.

To fix this, you need to encode your body to JSON. You can use the `jsonEncode` function from `dart:convert` library to do this.

Here's how you can modify your code:

```dart
import 'dart:convert';

Map<String,String> headers = {'Content-Type':'application/json','authorization':'Basic c3R1ZHlkb3RlOnN0dWR5ZG90ZTEyMw=='};

var body = jsonEncode({"grant_type":"password","username":"******","password":"*****","scope":"offline_access"});

var response = await post(Urls.getToken,
        headers: headers,
        body: body,
      );
```

This should solve your problem. The `jsonEncode` function converts the Map into a JSON string, which can then be sent in the body of your POST request.
