The issue you're experiencing might be due to the fact that macOS Catalina 10.15 uses `zsh` as the default shell instead of `bash`. This means that `~/.bash_profile` and `~/.profile` are not sourced by default when you open a new terminal window.

To set environment variables in `zsh`, you should add your `export` line to the `~/.zshrc` file instead. Here's how you can do it:

1. Open `~/.zshrc` in a text editor. If the file doesn't exist, you can create it.
    ```bash
    nano ~/.zshrc
    ```
2. Add your `export` line to the file.
    ```bash
    export JBOSS_HOME=/Users/{USERNAME}/Desktop/jboss7
    ```
3. Save and close the file.
4. Source the `~/.zshrc` file to apply the changes immediately.
    ```bash
    source ~/.zshrc
    ```
5. Now, when you execute `echo $JBOSS_HOME`, it should output the path you set.

Remember to replace `{USERNAME}` with your actual username.
