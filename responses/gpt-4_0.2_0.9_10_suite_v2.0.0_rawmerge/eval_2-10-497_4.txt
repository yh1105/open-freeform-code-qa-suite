In Rust, the `Box<T>` type is a smart pointer that points to data on the heap. It's important to note that `Box<T>` is non-nullable, meaning it can't be null. This is a safety feature in Rust to prevent null pointer dereferencing.

However, you can use `Option<Box<T>>` to represent a nullable `Box<T>`. The `Option<T>` enum has two variants: `Some(T)` and `None`. You can use `None` to represent a null pointer.

Here's how you can modify your code:

```rust
struct Node {
    value: i32,
    next: Option<Box<Node>>,
}

struct Stack {
    top: Option<Box<Node>>,
}
```

To check if the `Box<T>` is null, you can use the `is_none()` method:

```rust
if stack.top.is_none() {
    // The Box is null
} else {
    // The Box is not null
}
```

Or you can use pattern matching:

```rust
match stack.top {
    Some(_) => {
        // The Box is not null
    },
    None => {
        // The Box is null
    }
}
```

Remember to use `Some(Box::new(node))` when you want to assign a new `Node` to `top` or `next`.
