Deploying a Next.js application to Vercel should be straightforward, especially if you don't have a custom server or a complex `next.config.js` file. Here are a few things you can check:

1. **Check your project settings on Vercel**: Make sure you have set up your project correctly on Vercel. The Build Command should be `yarn run build` or `npm run build` and the Output Directory should be `out`.

2. **Check your routes**: If you're using dynamic routes, make sure you're using them correctly. The file structure of your `pages` directory should mirror your URL structure. For example, if you have a page that's accessed at `/user/[id]`, you should have a file at `pages/user/[id].js`.

3. **Check your `getStaticPaths` and `getStaticProps` (if you're using them)**: If you're using `getStaticPaths`, make sure you're returning all necessary paths. If you're using `getStaticProps`, make sure you're returning the correct props.

4. **Check your dependencies**: Make sure all your dependencies are listed in your `package.json` file and that you're not using any dependencies that aren't compatible with the serverless environment of Vercel.

5. **Check your API routes (if you have any)**: If you're using API routes, make sure they're set up correctly. They should be in the `pages/api` directory and their file structure should mirror your API URL structure.

6. **Check your environment variables**: If you're using environment variables, make sure they're set up correctly on Vercel. You can add them in the Settings tab of your project on Vercel.

7. **Check the logs**: If none of the above helps, check the deployment logs on Vercel. They should give you more information about what's going wrong.

If you're still having trouble, you might want to consider creating a minimal reproduction of your problem and asking for help on the Next.js GitHub page or on the Vercel support.
