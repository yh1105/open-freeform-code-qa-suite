You should use `@Configuration` when you want to define beans explicitly in your application. This annotation is typically used with `@Bean` annotation for methods to instantiate, configure, and initialize the objects that will be managed by the Spring IoC container.

On the other hand, `@Service`, `@Controller`, and `@Component` are stereotypes used for auto-detection of components. They are typically used when you want Spring to automatically manage your beans.

- `@Service`: Used in service layer classes.
- `@Controller`: Used in Spring MVC controller classes.
- `@Component`: A generic stereotype for any Spring-managed component.

So, if you need more control over the bean configuration, use `@Configuration`. If you want Spring to handle it automatically, use `@Service`, `@Controller`, or `@Component`.
