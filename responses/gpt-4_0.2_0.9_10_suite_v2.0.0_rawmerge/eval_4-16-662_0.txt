You can use `jq` to minify JSON in a shell script. `jq` is a lightweight and flexible command-line JSON processor. If it's not installed, you can install it using the package manager for your system. For example, on Ubuntu you can install it with `sudo apt-get install jq`.

Here is how you can use `jq` to minify your JSON:

```bash
echo '{
    "foo": "lorem",
    "bar": "ipsum"
}' | jq -c .
```

The `-c` option is for compact output, and `.` is the filter that matches any value, effectively passing the input directly to output.

This will output:

```bash
{"foo":"lorem","bar":"ipsum"}
```

You can also read from a file:

```bash
jq -c . file.json
```

And write to a file:

```bash
jq -c . input.json > output.json
```
