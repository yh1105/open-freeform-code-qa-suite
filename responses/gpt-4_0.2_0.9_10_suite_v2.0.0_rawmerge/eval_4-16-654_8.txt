To add an already generated SSH key to Git Bash, you need to follow these steps:

1. Open Git Bash.
2. Enter the following command to ensure ssh-agent is running:
    ```bash
    eval $(ssh-agent -s)
    ```
3. Now, add your SSH private key to the ssh-agent. If you created your key with a different name, or if you are adding an existing key that has a different name, replace `id_rsa` in the command with the name of your private key file.
    ```bash
    ssh-add D:/keys/id_rsa
    ```
Replace `id_rsa` with your private key filename.

Now your SSH key is added to Git Bash and you should be able to clone the repository.

Please note that Git Bash understands OpenSSH keys but not Puttygen keys. If you have a Puttygen key, you need to convert it to OpenSSH format using Puttygen before adding it to Git Bash.
