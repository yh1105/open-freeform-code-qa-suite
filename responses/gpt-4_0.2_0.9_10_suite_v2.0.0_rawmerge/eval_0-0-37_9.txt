Sure, you can use the `*` wildcard in your route to catch all the remaining segments of your URL. Here is the revised route pattern:

```javascript
/route/:param1/config/:OptionalParam2?/:OptionalParam3*
```

This route will match:

- `route/aa/config`
- `route/aa/config/bb`
- `route/aa/config/bb/cc`

Please note that `OptionalParam3*` will catch everything after `OptionalParam2`, including slashes, so you will need to parse it manually if you want to get individual segments.
