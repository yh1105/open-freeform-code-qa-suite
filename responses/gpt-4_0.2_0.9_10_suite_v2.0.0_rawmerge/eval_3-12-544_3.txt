The error you're seeing is because you're trying to access platform-specific code before `runApp()` has been called. This is a common issue when trying to perform asynchronous operations in the `main()` function.

To fix this, you should ensure that the Flutter engine is fully initialized before calling `getApplicationDocumentsDirectory()`. You can do this by calling `WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized()` before any other code in your `main()` function.

Here's how you can modify your code:

```dart
void main() async {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized(); // Ensure flutter is initialized
  final appDocsDir = await getApplicationDocumentsDirectory();
  Hive.init(appDocsDir.path);
  runApp(MyApp());
}
```

The `WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized()` method initializes the binding to the Flutter engine. This is required before you can use any plugins.
