You can use the `MSForms.DataObject` to interact with the clipboard. Here's a simple function that you can use to copy text to the clipboard:

```vba
Sub CopyToClipboard(s As String)
    Dim DataObj As MSForms.DataObject
    Set DataObj = New MSForms.DataObject
    DataObj.SetText s
    DataObj.PutInClipboard
    Set DataObj = Nothing
End Sub
```

You can use it like this:

```vba
CopyToClipboard Me.NodeKey.Value
```

Note: You need to add a reference to `Microsoft Forms 2.0 Object Library` to use `MSForms.DataObject`. You can do this by going to `Tools > References` in the VBA editor, and then checking `Microsoft Forms 2.0 Object Library`.

If you can't find `Microsoft Forms 2.0 Object Library`, you can add it by browsing for `FM20.DLL` in your system (usually located in `C:\Windows\System32` or `C:\Windows\SysWOW64`).
