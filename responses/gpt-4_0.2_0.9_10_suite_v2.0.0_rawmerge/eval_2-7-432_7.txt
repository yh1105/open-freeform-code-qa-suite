The error "419 Page Expired" is due to Laravel's built-in CSRF protection. When you log out from one tab, Laravel invalidates the session and the CSRF token associated with it. So, when you try to log out from the second tab, the CSRF token is no longer valid, hence the 419 error.

To solve this issue, you can catch the `TokenMismatchException` in your `Handler.php` file and redirect the user to the login page. Here's how you can do it:

```php
// app/Exceptions/Handler.php

public function render($request, Exception $exception)
{
    if ($exception instanceof \Illuminate\Session\TokenMismatchException) {
        return redirect('/login');
    }

    return parent::render($request, $exception);
}
```

This code will catch the `TokenMismatchException` which is thrown when the CSRF token is invalid. When this exception is caught, it will redirect the user to the login page.

Please note that this solution will apply to all forms in your application. If you want to apply this only to the logout action, you might need to customize this solution.
