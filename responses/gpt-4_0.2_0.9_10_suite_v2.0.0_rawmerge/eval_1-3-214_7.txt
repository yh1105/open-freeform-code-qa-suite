The error message you're seeing is due to a change in the pandas library. The `join_axes` parameter was deprecated in pandas 0.25 and removed in pandas 1.0. 

The version of pandas_profiling you're using is likely not compatible with the version of pandas you have installed. 

You can try to downgrade your pandas version to 0.25 or upgrade your pandas_profiling version.

To downgrade pandas, you can use:

```bash
pip install pandas==0.25
```

To upgrade pandas_profiling, you can use:

```bash
pip install --upgrade pandas-profiling
```

Alternatively, you can use the latest version of pandas_profiling which has a different syntax:

```python
from pandas_profiling import ProfileReport

profile = ProfileReport(df, explorative=True)
profile.to_widgets()
```

If you still get the `'DataFrame' object has no attribute 'profile_report'` error, it means that pandas_profiling is not correctly installed or imported. Make sure you have installed it correctly using pip or conda:

```bash
pip install pandas-profiling
```

or

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge pandas-profiling
```

And then import it in your notebook:

```python
from pandas_profiling import ProfileReport
```
