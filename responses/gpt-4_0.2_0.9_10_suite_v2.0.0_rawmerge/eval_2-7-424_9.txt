The error message suggests that Laravel does not have the necessary permissions to clear the cache. This could be due to the fact that the cache files are owned by a different user or group than the one running the `php artisan cache:clear` command.

Here are a few things you can try:

1. **Check File Permissions**: Ensure that the user running the command has write permissions to the `bootstrap/cache/` and `storage/framework/cache/` directories and their files.

2. **Run Command as Superuser**: If you have superuser access, you can try running the command as superuser with `sudo php artisan cache:clear`.

3. **Change Ownership**: If the files are owned by a different user, you can change the ownership to the user running the command. For example, if the user is `www-data`, you can run `sudo chown -R www-data:www-data storage bootstrap/cache`.

Remember to replace `www-data` with the actual user running the command. Be careful when changing file ownerships and permissions, as incorrect settings can potentially lead to security issues.
