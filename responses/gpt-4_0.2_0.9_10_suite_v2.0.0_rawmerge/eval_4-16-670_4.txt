Yes, you can convert your OpenSSH private key to a RSA private key. The OpenSSH key format is not supported by all software, so sometimes it is necessary to convert it to the more traditional PEM format. 

Here is how you can do it:

1. Convert the OpenSSH private key to RSA private key:

```bash
ssh-keygen -p -m PEM -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```

This command will ask you to enter a passphrase before the key is saved again. If you don't want to change the passphrase, just press enter when prompted.

2. You don't need to convert the public key. The public key format is standard and should be accepted everywhere the private key is. The public key doesn't have a header like the private key, so you don't need to worry about converting it.

Remember, this process doesn't generate a new key, it just changes the format of the existing key. The public key remains the same and you don't need to send it again to the server administrator.
