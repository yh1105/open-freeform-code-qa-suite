You can add your SSH key to Git Bash by using the `ssh-add` command. However, the key generated by PuTTYgen is in a .ppk format which is not directly compatible with Git Bash. You need to convert it to the OpenSSH format first.

Here are the steps:

1. Open PuTTYgen, click 'Load' and select your .ppk key.
2. Once the key is loaded, go to 'Conversions' from the menu and select 'Export OpenSSH key'.
3. Save the key to a location, for example `D:/keys/my_key`.

Now, you can add this key to ssh-agent in Git Bash:

1. Start the ssh-agent in the background:

```bash
eval $(ssh-agent -s)
```

2. Add your SSH private key to the ssh-agent:

```bash
ssh-add D:/keys/my_key
```

Now, your SSH key is added to Git Bash and you can use it to clone the repository.
