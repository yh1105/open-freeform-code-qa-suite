It seems like there's a misunderstanding here. iOS doesn't have a "Developer Mode" like Android does. The alert you're seeing is likely related to the provisioning profile used to sign the app you're trying to run.

If you're trying to run a development build of an app, you'll need to have the device registered in your Apple Developer account and the provisioning profile used to sign the app must include that device.

Here are the steps to do that:

1. Log in to your Apple Developer account.
2. Go to Certificates, Identifiers & Profiles.
3. Under Devices, click on All.
4. Click the '+' button to add a new device.
5. Enter the device's name and UDID. You can find the UDID by connecting the device to a Mac, opening iTunes, selecting the device and clicking on the serial number.
6. Click Continue and then Register.
7. Now you need to add this device to the provisioning profile. Go to Profiles, then All.
8. Find the provisioning profile used to sign the app and click on it.
9. Click Edit.
10. Under Devices, check the box next to the device you just added.
11. Click Generate, then Download.
12. Double-click the downloaded file to install the updated provisioning profile.
13. Rebuild and reinstall the app.

If you're not the developer of the app, you'll need to ask the developer to do these steps for you. Alternatively, they can use an Ad Hoc or Enterprise provisioning profile to allow the app to be installed on any device.
