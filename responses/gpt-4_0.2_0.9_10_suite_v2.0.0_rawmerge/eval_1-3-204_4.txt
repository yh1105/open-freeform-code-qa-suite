The `rename` function is used to rename the DataFrame's index or columns directly, not the result of a groupby operation. The result of the `groupby` operation is a Series, not a DataFrame, so it doesn't have a `columns` attribute. 

To rename the column of the result, you can convert the Series to a DataFrame and then rename the column. Here is the function `renameDataFrame`:

```python
def renameDataFrame(df):
    avg = df.groupby(["t"], sort=False)["p"].mean().to_frame()
    avg.columns = ["mean"]
    return avg
```

In this function, `df.groupby(["t"], sort=False)["p"].mean().to_frame()` groups the DataFrame by the "t" column, calculates the mean of the "p" column for each group, and converts the result to a DataFrame. `avg.columns = ["mean"]` renames the column to "mean". 

You can use this function like this:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

datain = np.array([[1,2,3,4,5],[1,3,4,5,6],[2,4,5,6,7],[2,5,6,7,8]])
df = pd.DataFrame(data = datain, columns = ["t","p","x","y","z"])
print(renameDataFrame(df))
```

This will print:

```
   mean
t      
1   2.5
2   4.5
```

This shows that the function has correctly calculated the mean of the "p" column for each group and renamed the column to "mean".
