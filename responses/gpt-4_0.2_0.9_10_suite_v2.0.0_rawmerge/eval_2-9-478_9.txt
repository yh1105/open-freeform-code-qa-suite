The error you're encountering is likely due to a version incompatibility between Devise and the version of Rails you're using. Devise 4.8.0 is not compatible with Rails versions below 6.1.

Here are a few steps you can take to resolve this issue:

1. **Upgrade Rails to a compatible version.** If you're not restricted to a specific Rails version for your project, you can upgrade Rails to a version compatible with Devise 4.8.0. You can do this by updating your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'rails', '~> 6.1'
```

Then run `bundle update rails` in your terminal.

2. **Use a compatible version of Devise.** If you can't upgrade Rails, you can use a version of Devise that's compatible with your current Rails version. For Rails 5.2, Devise 4.7.3 should work. Update your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'devise', '~> 4.7.3'
```

Then run `bundle update devise` in your terminal.

Remember to restart your Rails server after making these changes.
