The error message is indicating that Django is trying to reverse the URL for 'profile' but it's not finding a match because the argument being passed is empty. 

This is happening in your `index.html` file, specifically in this line:

```html
<a href="{% url 'profile' post.author.username %}">
```

The error occurs because `post.author.username` is empty for some posts. This could be due to the fact that some posts don't have an associated author or the author doesn't have a username.

To fix this, you should check if `post.author.username` exists before trying to create the URL. Here's how you can do it:

```html
{% if post.author and post.author.username %}
    <a href="{% url 'profile' post.author.username %}">
        @{{post.author.username}}
    </a>
{% endif %}
```

This will ensure that the URL is only created when `post.author.username` is not empty.
