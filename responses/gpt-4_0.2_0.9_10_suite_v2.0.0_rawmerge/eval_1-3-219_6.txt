This issue can be caused by several factors. Here are some steps you can follow to troubleshoot and possibly resolve the issue:

1. **Check your Python Interpreter:** Make sure you have the correct Python interpreter selected for your workspace. You can change the Python interpreter by clicking on the Python version in the bottom-left of the status bar or by using the `Python: Select Interpreter` command from the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`).

2. **Check your Jupyter Server:** You can try to start your Jupyter server manually to see if there are any issues. Open a terminal in your `da38` environment and run `jupyter notebook`. If there are any errors, they should be displayed in the terminal.

3. **Reinstall Jupyter:** You can try reinstalling Jupyter in your `da38` environment. Open a terminal in your `da38` environment and run `conda install jupyter`.

4. **Check your VS Code settings:** There might be some settings in VS Code that are causing the issue. You can reset your settings to the default by going to `File > Preferences > Settings` and searching for the setting you want to reset. You can also try disabling any extensions that might be interfering with the Python extension.

5. **Check your Python and IPyKernel versions:** Make sure you have compatible versions of Python and IPyKernel installed in your `da38` environment. You can check the versions by running `python --version` and `python -m ipykernel --version` in a terminal in your `da38` environment.

6. **Reinstall VS Code:** If none of the above steps work, you can try reinstalling VS Code. Make sure to uninstall it first and then download the latest version from the official website.

Remember to restart VS Code after making these changes to ensure they take effect. If the problem persists, you might want to consider submitting an issue on the VS Code GitHub page.
