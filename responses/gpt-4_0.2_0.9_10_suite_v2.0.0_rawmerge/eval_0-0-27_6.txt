The issue you're facing might be due to several reasons. Here are a few things you can check:

1. **Network Connection**: Ensure that your device/emulator has a proper internet connection. 

2. **Server Status**: The server you're trying to fetch data from might be down or not responding. You can check the server status by visiting the URL directly in your web browser.

3. **CORS Policy**: If you're running your app on a local server, you might face issues due to CORS policy. The server you're fetching data from needs to allow requests from your origin. 

4. **Apollo Client Version**: There might be compatibility issues with the version of Apollo Client you're using. Try downgrading or upgrading the version.

5. **Query Syntax**: Ensure that your GraphQL query is correct. You can test your query in a GraphQL playground.

6. **React Native Debugger**: If you're using React Native Debugger, there might be an issue with it and Apollo Client. Try disabling it and see if the issue persists.

If none of the above solutions work, you can try to debug the issue by catching and logging the error in your `useQuery` hook:

```javascript
const { loading, error, data } = useQuery(EXCHANGE_RATES, {
    onError: (err) => console.log(err),
});
```

This will give you more detailed information about what's going wrong.
