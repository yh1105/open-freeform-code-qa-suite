Your code seems to be on the right track, but there are a few issues that need to be addressed:

1. You are trying to use `query` and `currentSheet` as variables, but you have not declared them. In VBA, you need to declare variables before using them.

2. You are trying to use `query` as a `WorkbookQuery` object, but you are assigning it a string value. You need to create a `WorkbookQuery` object and assign it to `query`.

3. The `Location` in the connection string should be the name of the query, not the value of the query.

Here is a corrected version of your code:

```vba
Sub LoadToWorksheetOnly()

    Dim query As String
    Dim currentSheet As String

    ' Get the name of the query from Sheet6
    query = Sheets("Sheet6").Range("A1").Value

    ' Get the name of the active sheet
    currentSheet = ActiveSheet.Name

    ' Add a new ListObject with a QueryTable that uses the Power Query
    With ActiveSheet.ListObjects.Add(SourceType:=0, Source:= _
        "OLEDB;Provider=Microsoft.Mashup.OleDb.1;Data Source=$Workbook$;Location=" & query _
        , Destination:=Sheets("target").Range("$A$1")).QueryTable
        .CommandType = xlCmdDefault
        .CommandText = Array("SELECT * FROM [" & query & "]")
        .RowNumbers = False
        .FillAdjacentFormulas = False
        .PreserveFormatting = True
        .RefreshOnFileOpen = False
        .BackgroundQuery = True
        .RefreshStyle = xlInsertDeleteCells
        .SavePassword = False
        .SaveData = True
        .AdjustColumnWidth = True
        .RefreshPeriod = 0
        .PreserveColumnInfo = False
        .Refresh BackgroundQuery:=False
    End With

End Sub
```

This code assumes that the name of the Power Query is stored in cell A1 of Sheet6. If you want to use the actual M code from the Power Query, you will need to create a new `WorkbookQuery` object and assign the M code to it. However, this is not currently supported in VBA.
