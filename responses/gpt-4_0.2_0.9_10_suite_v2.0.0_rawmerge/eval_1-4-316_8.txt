The error you're seeing is because the `sort` function in R doesn't work directly on lists. However, you can use the `unlist` function to convert the list to a vector, sort the vector, and then convert it back to a list if needed.

Here's how you can define the `mySort` function:

```r
mySort <- function(l) {
  # Unlist the list to a vector
  vector_data <- unlist(l)
  
  # Sort the vector
  sorted_vector <- sort(vector_data)
  
  # Convert back to list and return
  sorted_list <- as.list(sorted_vector)
  
  return(sorted_list)
}
```

You can then use this function to sort your list:

```r
# Sort list alphabetically
sorted_data = mySort(list_text_data)
```

This will give you the sorted list of letters.
