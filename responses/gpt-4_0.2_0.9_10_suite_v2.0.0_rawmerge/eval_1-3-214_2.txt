The error message you're seeing is due to a change in the pandas library. The `join_axes` parameter was deprecated in pandas 0.25 and removed in pandas 1.0. 

The `pandas_profiling` library you're using seems to be using this deprecated feature, hence the error. 

To solve this issue, you can try the following steps:

1. Uninstall the current `pandas_profiling` library.
2. Install a specific version of `pandas_profiling` that is compatible with your pandas version.

Here's how you can do it:

```bash
pip uninstall pandas_profiling
pip install pandas_profiling==2.7.1
```

After this, you should be able to generate the profile report as follows:

```python
from pandas_profiling import ProfileReport

profile = ProfileReport(data, explorative=True)
profile.to_widgets()
```

If you still encounter the error `'DataFrame' object has no attribute 'profile_report'`, it means that the `pandas_profiling` library is not properly installed or imported. Make sure you have installed it correctly and imported it in your script.
