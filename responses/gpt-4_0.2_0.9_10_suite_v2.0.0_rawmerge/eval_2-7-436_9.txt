The error message you're seeing is indicating that your current PHP version, PHP extensions, or Composer version is not compatible with Laravel 9.

Here are the steps you should take to resolve this issue:

1. **Check your PHP version**: Laravel 9 requires PHP version 8.0 or higher. You can check your PHP version by running the following command in your terminal:

    ```bash
    php -v
    ```

    If your PHP version is lower than 8.0, you'll need to upgrade it.

2. **Check your PHP extensions**: Laravel 9 requires the following PHP extensions: BCMath, Ctype, Fileinfo, JSON, Mbstring, OpenSSL, PDO, Tokenizer, and XML. You can check your installed extensions by running:

    ```bash
    php -m
    ```

    If any of the required extensions are missing, you'll need to install them.

3. **Check your Composer version**: Make sure you're using the latest version of Composer. You can check your composer version by running:

    ```bash
    composer --version
    ```

    If you're not using the latest version, you can update Composer by running:

    ```bash
    composer self-update
    ```

After ensuring that your PHP version, PHP extensions, and Composer version meet the requirements, try running the `composer create-project` command again. If you're still encountering issues, it may be helpful to clear your Composer cache by running `composer clear-cache`.
