You can change the color of the accordion arrow by targeting the `::after` pseudo-element of the `.accordion-button` class. This pseudo-element is responsible for the arrow. Here is how you can do it:

```css
.accordion-button::after {
    /* You may want to include vendor prefixes for older browsers */
    color: green;
}
```

However, Bootstrap 5 uses a background-image for the accordion arrows, not a color. So, you need to replace the background image with a new one that has the color you want. Unfortunately, this is not as simple as just changing a color.

A workaround is to use a Unicode character for the arrow and rotate it when the accordion is open:

```css
.accordion-button::after {
    content: '\25B6';  /* Unicode right arrow */
    color: green;
    font-size: 0.6em;
    position: relative;
    top: -2px;
    /* Reset the default rotation */
    transform: rotate(0deg);
}

.accordion-button:not(.collapsed)::after {
    /* Unicode down arrow */
    content: '\25BC';
}
```

This will replace the default arrow with a green right arrow, which turns into a down arrow when the accordion is open.
