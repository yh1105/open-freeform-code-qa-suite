The error you're encountering is due to the fact that AWS Lambda expects a Linux executable, but you're providing a Windows executable. When you run `go build main.go` on a Windows machine, it produces a Windows executable (`main.exe`), not a Linux one.

To solve this issue, you need to cross-compile your Go code for Linux. Here's how you can do it:

1. Open your terminal.
2. Navigate to the directory containing your `main.go` file.
3. Set the environment variables for Linux and run the build command:

```bash
SET GOOS=linux
SET GOARCH=amd64
go build -o main main.go
```

This will create a Linux executable named `main` in the same directory.

4. Zip the Linux executable:

```bash
zip function.zip main
```

5. Now, upload `function.zip` to AWS Lambda.

Remember to set the handler name to `main` (the name of your executable) when you upload the zip file to AWS Lambda.

After following these steps, your Lambda function should execute without any issues.
