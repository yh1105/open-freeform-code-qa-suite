The error you're encountering is due to the fact that you're trying to use `await` in the `main` function without making the `main` function asynchronous.

In Flutter, you need to ensure that `WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized()` is called before you use any plugins if you're calling them before `runApp()`. This is because Flutter plugins are initialized after `runApp()` is called.

Here's how you can fix your code:

```dart
void main() async {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized(); // Add this line
  final appDocsDir = await getApplicationDocumentsDirectory();
  Hive.init(appDocsDir.path);
  runApp(MyApp());
}
```

This will ensure that the Flutter engine is properly initialized before you try to use the `path_provider` plugin.
