Sure, you can use the `*` wildcard to catch all the remaining path. Here is the revised route pattern:

```javascript
/route/:param1/config/:OptionalParam2?/*
```

This pattern will catch all of the following routes:

- `route/aa/config`
- `route/aa/config/bb`
- `route/aa/config/bb/cc`

In your route handler, you can split the remaining path by `/` to get the optional parameters.
