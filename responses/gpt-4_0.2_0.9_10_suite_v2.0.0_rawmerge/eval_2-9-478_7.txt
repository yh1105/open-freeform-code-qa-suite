The error you're encountering is likely due to a compatibility issue between the version of Rails you're using and the version of Devise. 

The latest version of Devise (4.8.0 at the time of writing) requires Rails 5.2 or higher. If you're using an older version of Rails, you may need to use an older version of Devise.

You can specify a specific version of Devise in your Gemfile. For example, if you're using Rails 5.1, you might use Devise 4.7.1:

```ruby
gem 'devise', '~> 4.7.1'
```

After updating your Gemfile, run `bundle install` to install the specified version of Devise.

If you're already using Rails 5.2 or higher and still encountering this issue, it might be a bug in Devise or in your application. In that case, you might try:

- Checking the [Devise GitHub issues](https://github.com/heartcombo/devise/issues) to see if anyone else has reported the same problem.
- Creating a minimal application that reproduces the problem, to help isolate whether it's an issue with your application or with Devise itself.
- Reporting the issue on the Devise GitHub issues if you believe it's a bug in Devise.
