The error you're seeing is typically due to the response from the server not being a valid JSON string. This can occur if the server is returning an error message, HTML, or any other non-JSON response.

Here are a few steps you can take to debug and solve this issue:

1. **Print the server response**: Before trying to decode the response, print it to the console. This will allow you to see exactly what you're trying to decode.

```dart
print('Response body: ${response.body}');
```

2. **Check the server-side script**: Make sure that your PHP script is correctly outputting a JSON response. You can do this by running the script independently and checking the output.

3. **Handle non-200 HTTP responses**: If the server returns an HTTP status code other than 200, it means that there was an error. You should check the status code before trying to decode the response.

```dart
if (response.statusCode == 200) {
  List data = json.decode(response.body);
} else {
  print('Request failed with status: ${response.statusCode}.');
}
```

4. **Use `try/catch` to handle exceptions**: This will allow you to handle any exceptions that occur when decoding the JSON, and print a more detailed error message.

```dart
try {
  List data = json.decode(response.body);
} catch (e) {
  print('Error: $e');
}
```

By following these steps, you should be able to identify and fix the issue causing the `FormatException`.
