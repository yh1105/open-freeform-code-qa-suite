Yes, you can achieve the same result using the `INDEX` and `SMALL` functions in Excel. Here's an example of how you can do it:

```excel
=INDEX($B$1:$B$100, SMALL(IF($A$1:$A$100="x", ROW($A$1:$A$100)-MIN(ROW($A$1:$A$100))+1, ""), ROW(A1)))
```

This formula will return the same result as the `FILTER` function. It will return the values from `Column B` if `Column A` on the same row has a value of `x`.

Please note that this is an array formula, so you need to press `Ctrl+Shift+Enter` after typing the formula instead of just `Enter`.

If you want to use a macro, you can use the following VBA code:

```vba
Sub FilterData()
    Dim rng As Range
    Dim outputRow As Long

    outputRow = 2

    For Each rng In ThisWorkbook.Sheets("Sheet1").Range("A1:A100")
        If rng.Value = "x" Then
            ThisWorkbook.Sheets("Sheet2").Cells(outputRow, "B").Value = rng.Offset(0, 1).Value
            outputRow = outputRow + 1
        End If
    Next rng
End Sub
```

This macro will copy the values from `Column B` to `Sheet2` if `Column A` on the same row has a value of `x`. You can adjust the range and the sheets according to your needs.
