The error message `ImportError: DLL load failed while importing _psycopg: The operating system cannot run %1.` indicates that the psycopg2 library is having trouble finding a required DLL (Dynamic-Link Library) file.

This issue is often caused by one of the following:

1. The psycopg2 library was not installed correctly.
2. The required DLL file is not in the system's PATH.
3. There is a version mismatch between Python, psycopg2, and the PostgreSQL server.

Here are some steps you can take to troubleshoot and potentially resolve this issue:

**Reinstall psycopg2**

Uninstall and then reinstall psycopg2. Sometimes, a fresh install can resolve the issue.

```bash
conda uninstall psycopg2
conda install -c anaconda psycopg2
```

**Install psycopg2-binary**

If reinstalling psycopg2 does not work, try installing psycopg2-binary instead. This version of the library includes the PostgreSQL library statically linked, so it does not require any additional DLL files.

```bash
conda uninstall psycopg2
pip install psycopg2-binary
```

**Check the System's PATH**

Ensure that the PostgreSQL server's bin directory is in the system's PATH. The psycopg2 library requires DLL files from this directory. The exact directory depends on where PostgreSQL was installed, but it is typically something like `C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\13\bin`.

**Check Version Compatibility**

Ensure that the versions of Python, psycopg2, and the PostgreSQL server are all compatible with each other. You might need to install a different version of one or more of these components to resolve the issue.

**Use a Virtual Environment**

If you are not already doing so, consider using a virtual environment. This can help isolate the Python and library versions required for your project, potentially avoiding version conflicts.

```bash
conda create -n myenv python=3.8
conda activate myenv
conda install -c anaconda psycopg2
```

Remember to replace `myenv` and `3.8` with the name of your environment and the Python version you want to use, respectively.
