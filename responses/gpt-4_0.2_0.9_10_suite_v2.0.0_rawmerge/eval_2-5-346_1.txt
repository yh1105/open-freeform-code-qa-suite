The error you're encountering is because Gradle is not using the correct Java version. You've set the source compatibility to Java 17 in your `build.gradle` file, but Gradle might still be using an older version of Java.

To resolve this issue, you need to ensure that Gradle is using Java 17. You can do this by setting the `org.gradle.java.home` property in the `gradle.properties` file to point to your Java 17 installation.

Here's how to do it:

1. Locate your `gradle.properties` file. This file is usually located in the root directory of your project. If it doesn't exist, you can create it.

2. Add the following line to the `gradle.properties` file:

```properties
org.gradle.java.home=/path/to/your/java17/installation
```

Replace `/path/to/your/java17/installation` with the actual path to your Java 17 installation.

3. Save the `gradle.properties` file and try to build your project again.

If you're not sure where your Java 17 installation is, you can find it by running the following command in the terminal:

```bash
/usr/libexec/java_home -v 17
```

This command will print the path to your Java 17 installation.

If you're using Windows, the path might look something like this:

```properties
org.gradle.java.home=C:\\Program Files\\Java\\jdk-17
```

Remember to use double backslashes (`\\`) in the path if you're using Windows.
