The `SelectByID2` method is used to select entities in SolidWorks. The `Name` parameter is the name of the entity to select. For faces and edges, this is typically an empty string. The `Type` parameter is the type of entity to select, such as `swSelFACES` or `swSelEDGES`. The `X`, `Y`, and `Z` parameters are the coordinates of the entity to select. For faces and edges, these are typically the coordinates of a point on the entity.

Here's how you can modify your code to select the face and the midpoint:

```vba
' Select the face
selBool = swModel.Extension.SelectByID2("", "FACE", 0, 0, 0, False, 0, Nothing, 0)
Debug.Print selBool

' Select the midpoint
selBool = swModel.Extension.SelectByID2("", "VERTEX", X, Y, Z, True, 0, Nothing, 0)
Debug.Print selBool
```

In the above code, `X`, `Y`, and `Z` should be the coordinates of the midpoint. You can get these coordinates from the `midpointObj` variable. Also, note that the `Append` parameter is set to `False` when selecting the face and `True` when selecting the midpoint. This is because you want to start a new selection with the face and then add the midpoint to the existing selection.

After selecting the face and the midpoint, you can call the `InsertRefPlane` method to create the reference plane:

```vba
swFeatMgr.InsertRefPlane(3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0)
```

In the above code, the first parameter is the type of reference plane to create. The value `3` creates a plane using a face and a point. The other parameters are not used in this case and are set to `0`.
