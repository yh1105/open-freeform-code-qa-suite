Yes, you're correct. Since Spring 4.3, if a class has only one constructor, the `@Autowired` annotation is no longer necessary. Spring will use that constructor automatically for dependency injection.

However, there are a few reasons why people might still use `@Autowired`:

1. **Explicitness**: It makes it clear that Spring is managing this bean and injecting dependencies.
2. **Backward compatibility**: Older versions of Spring required `@Autowired` for dependency injection.
3. **Multiple constructors**: If a class has more than one constructor, Spring won't know which one to use for dependency injection unless you specify `@Autowired`.

So, while it's not necessary to use `@Autowired` with a single constructor, it can still be helpful for clarity and compatibility.
