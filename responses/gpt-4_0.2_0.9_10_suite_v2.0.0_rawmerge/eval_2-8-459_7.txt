The error message indicates that Go is unable to find the specific revision of the module `github.ibm.com/kms/key-protect-client` that you're trying to use. This could be due to a variety of reasons, including network issues, incorrect configuration, or access control.

Here are some steps you can take to debug this issue:

1. **Check your network connection:** Ensure that you have a stable internet connection and that you're able to access `github.ibm.com` from your browser.

2. **Check your Go version:** Make sure you're using the same Go version on both computers. You can check your Go version by running `go version` in your terminal.

3. **Check your Go environment variables:** Run `go env` to check your Go environment variables. Pay special attention to `GOPATH`, `GOROOT`, and `GOPROXY`. If `GOPROXY` is set to `direct`, Go will try to download modules directly from their sources instead of using the Go module proxy.

4. **Check your Git configuration:** If the module is hosted on a private repository, you need to make sure that Git is configured correctly to access this repository. You can check your Git configuration by running `git config --list`.

5. **Check your access to the private repository:** Try to clone the private repository directly using Git. If you're unable to clone the repository, you might need to update your access credentials.

6. **Check the module's version:** Ensure that the version `v0.1.5` of the module `github.ibm.com/kms/key-protect-client` actually exists. You can check this by visiting the repository on GitHub and looking at the list of tags.

7. **Try to download the module manually:** You can try to download the module manually by running `go get github.ibm.com/kms/key-protect-client@v0.1.5`.

8. **Check the Go module cache:** Go stores downloaded modules in a local cache. You can check the contents of this cache by running `go list -m all`.

9. **Clear the Go module cache:** If all else fails, you can try to clear the Go module cache by running `go clean -modcache`.

Remember to replace `github.ibm.com/kms/key-protect-client@v0.1.5` with the actual module and version you're trying to use.
