The issue you're experiencing might be related to the configuration of your server or the Laravel application itself. Here are a few things you could check:

1. **Domain Configuration**: Ensure that your domain is correctly configured in your `.env` file. The `APP_URL` should match the domain you're using. If you're using `www` in your domain, make sure it's included in the `APP_URL`.

2. **Session Domain**: In your `config/session.php` file, check the `domain` configuration. If it's set to `null`, Laravel will use the domain from the `APP_URL` in your `.env` file. If you're using subdomains and want to share sessions, you should set it to your root domain preceded by a `.` (e.g., `.yourdomain.com`).

3. **Secure Cookies**: If your `config/session.php` has `secure` set to `true`, it means that Laravel will only send the cookie over HTTPS. If your server is not configured to use HTTPS, this could be causing the issue.

4. **Cookie SameSite Attribute**: The `same_site` attribute in `config/session.php` determines whether the browser should send cookies along with cross-site requests. The possible values are `lax`, `strict`, `none`, or `null`. If it's set to `strict`, the browser will not send the cookie with any cross-site requests. If it's set to `lax`, the browser will send the cookie with top-level navigation. If it's set to `none`, the browser will send the cookie with cross-site requests. If it's `null`, the browser will use its default behavior.

5. **File Permissions**: Ensure that the `storage/framework/sessions` directory is writable by the server. If Laravel can't write to this directory, it won't be able to store session data.

6. **Server Configuration**: Some hosting providers have specific configurations that can interfere with session handling. For example, some hosts have a security setting that deletes session files in a short time, which could cause a CSRF token mismatch. Check with your hosting provider if there are any such configurations.

7. **Cache Configuration**: Try clearing your application cache using `php artisan config:cache` and `php artisan cache:clear` commands. Sometimes, old cached configurations can cause issues.

Remember to restart your server after making these changes to ensure they take effect.
