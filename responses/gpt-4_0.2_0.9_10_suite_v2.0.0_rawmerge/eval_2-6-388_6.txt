The `[Keyless]` attribute is not part of the `System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations` namespace. It's part of the `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore` namespace. 

You need to install the `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Relational` package to your project to use it. 

You can install it via NuGet package manager or by running the following command in the Package Manager Console:

```shell
Install-Package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Relational
```

After that, you should be able to use the `[Keyless]` attribute in your model class by adding the correct using statement:

```csharp
using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore;

[Keyless]
public class MyKeylessClass
{
    // ...
}
```

Please note that the `[Keyless]` attribute is available starting from EF Core 5.0. If you're using an older version, you may need to upgrade.
