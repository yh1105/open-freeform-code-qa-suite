To conform to `ShapeStyle` protocol, you need to implement a `func _apply(to shape: inout _ShapeStyle_ShapeType)` method in your struct. Here is how you can do it:

```swift
struct MyContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        Circle()
            .fill(RedShapeStyle())
    }
}

struct RedShapeStyle: ShapeStyle {
    func _apply(to shape: inout _ShapeStyle_ShapeType) {
        shape.fill = Color.red._apply(to: &shape)
    }
}
```

However, `_ShapeStyle_ShapeType` and `_apply(to:)` are underscored because they are private APIs, which means they are not intended for public use and may change in future versions of SwiftUI. 

A better and safer way to achieve this is to use `some ShapeStyle` in your `RedView`:

```swift
struct MyContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        Circle()
            .fill(RedView().color)
    }
}

struct RedView {
    var color: some ShapeStyle {
        Color.red
    }
}
```

This way, you are not using any private APIs and your `RedView` can provide a `ShapeStyle` that can be used to fill a shape.
