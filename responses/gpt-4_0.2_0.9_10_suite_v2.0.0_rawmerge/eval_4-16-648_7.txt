The error message you're seeing indicates that the directory you're trying to write to is a read-only file system. This means you don't have permission to write to this directory.

On macOS Catalina and later versions, the system has implemented a new feature that separates data into two volumes: one is a read-only system volume, and the other is a data volume. The root directory `/` is on the read-only system volume, which is why you're unable to create a directory at `/data/db`.

Instead, you should create directories in your home directory or under `/Users/Shared/` if you want it to be accessible to all users. 

For example, you could create the directory in your home directory:

```bash
mkdir ~/data/db
```

Or in the shared directory:

```bash

sudo mkdir -p /Users/Shared/data/db
```

If you're trying to set up MongoDB, you can specify the db path when you start it:

```bash
mongod --dbpath ~/data/db
```

Or:

```bash
mongod --dbpath /Users/Shared/data/db
```

Remember to replace `~/data/db` and `/Users/Shared/data/db` with your actual paths.
