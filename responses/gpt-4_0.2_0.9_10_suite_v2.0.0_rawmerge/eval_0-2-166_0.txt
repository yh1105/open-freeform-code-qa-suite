Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom user interfaces. However, it doesn't provide a way to directly target child elements like you would do in CSS with the child combinator (`>`). 

Tailwind CSS works by adding utility classes directly to HTML elements, rather than defining CSS selectors and rulesets. This means you would need to add the Tailwind CSS classes to the child `div` elements directly.

For example:

```html
<div class="section">
  <div class="bg-blue-500">...</div>
  <div class="text-white">...</div>
</div>
```

In this example, the child `div` elements of the `div` with the class `section` have the Tailwind CSS classes `bg-blue-500` and `text-white` applied to them directly.

If you need to apply styles to direct children elements and those styles can't be applied directly to the elements themselves (for example, if the elements are being generated by a third-party library), you might need to use custom CSS in addition to Tailwind CSS.
