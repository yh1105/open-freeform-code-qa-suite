The error you're seeing is due to the fact that you're trying to use Flutter's engine before it's fully initialized. The `getApplicationDocumentsDirectory()` function relies on Flutter's engine to communicate with the native platform, and this engine isn't available until after `runApp()` has been called.

To fix this, you can use the `WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized()` method. This method ensures that the Flutter engine is initialized before you try to use it.

Here's how you can modify your code:

```dart
void main() async {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  final appDocsDir = await getApplicationDocumentsDirectory();
  Hive.init(appDocsDir.path);
  runApp(MyApp());
}
```

The `WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized()` method is typically used in the `main()` function in Flutter apps to ensure that the Flutter engine is ready before any other part of the app tries to use it.
