This problem could be due to several reasons. Here are some steps you can take to troubleshoot and possibly resolve the issue:

1. **Check your Python Interpreter**: Make sure that the Python interpreter selected in VS Code is the one from your 'da38' environment. You can check this by clicking on the Python version in the bottom left corner of the VS Code window.

2. **Check your Jupyter Installation**: Make sure that Jupyter is properly installed in your 'da38' environment. You can do this by activating your environment in the terminal and running `jupyter notebook`. If it's not installed, you can install it using `conda install jupyter`.

3. **Check your IPyKernel Installation**: Make sure that IPyKernel is properly installed in your 'da38' environment. You can do this by activating your environment in the terminal and running `python -m ipykernel install --user`. If it's not installed, you can install it using `conda install ipykernel`.

4. **Check your VS Code Settings**: Make sure that the Python and Jupyter extensions are properly configured in VS Code. You can check this by going to the settings (File > Preferences > Settings) and searching for 'Python' and 'Jupyter'. Make sure that the Python path is set to the Python interpreter in your 'da38' environment and that the Jupyter path is set to the Jupyter installation in your 'da38' environment.

5. **Check your VS Code Extensions**: Make sure that you have the latest versions of the Python and Jupyter extensions installed in VS Code. You can check this by going to the extensions view (View > Extensions) and searching for 'Python' and 'Jupyter'. If they are not up-to-date, you can update them by clicking on the 'Update' button.

6. **Reinstall VS Code**: If none of the above steps work, you might want to consider reinstalling VS Code. Before you do this, make sure to uninstall VS Code completely, including deleting its data and settings folders, and then reinstall it.

If you're still having problems after trying these steps, you might want to consider asking for help on the VS Code GitHub page or on Stack Overflow.
