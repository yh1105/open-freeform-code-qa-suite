The `Get-Service` cmdlet does not provide the service description. However, you can use the `Get-WmiObject` cmdlet to get the service description. Here is an example:

```powershell
Get-WmiObject -Query "Select * From Win32_Service" | Select-Object Name, Description | Out-GridView
```

This will give you a list of all services with their names and descriptions.

If you want to get the description of a specific service, you can filter it by the service name. For example, to get the description of the "wuauserv" service, you can use the following command:

```powershell
Get-WmiObject -Query "Select * From Win32_Service Where Name = 'wuauserv'" | Select-Object Name, Description
```

This will return the name and description of the "wuauserv" service.
