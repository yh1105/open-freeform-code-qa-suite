The issue is with the single quotes around the variable `$searchT`. In bash, single quotes will treat the enclosed characters literally, meaning that `$searchT` is not being expanded to its value. You should use double quotes instead. Here is the corrected script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
read -p "enter search term here: " searchT

if [[ $(cat test.txt | grep -wi "$searchT") ]]; then     
    echo "$(cat test.txt | grep "$searchT" | wc -l) number of matches found"
    echo $(cat test.txt | grep "$searchT")

else 
    echo "no match found"    

fi

exit 0
```

Also, note that in the `echo` line, I've moved the `| wc -l` to only count the lines from the `grep` command, not from the entire `cat` command. This will give you the correct number of matches.
