The `rename` function is used to rename the DataFrame's index or columns. However, in your case, you are trying to rename the Series object returned by the `mean` function. The `mean` function returns a Series object with the group labels as the index and the computed mean as the values. 

To rename the Series, you can convert it to a DataFrame and then use the `rename` function. Here is the function you requested:

```python
def renameDataFrame(df):
    avg = df.groupby(["t"], sort=False)["p"].mean().to_frame().rename(columns={"p":"mean"})
    return avg
```

In this function, `to_frame()` is used to convert the Series to a DataFrame, and then `rename` is used to rename the column. The `sort=False` argument in `groupby` is used to maintain the original order of the "t" column.
