The issue you're experiencing might be due to the fact that macOS Catalina 10.15 uses `zsh` as the default shell instead of `bash`. This change means that `~/.bash_profile` and `~/.profile` are not sourced when you open a new terminal window.

To set environment variables in `zsh`, you should add them to the `~/.zshrc` file. If the file doesn't exist, you can create it.

Here's how you can do it:

1. Open Terminal.
2. Open `~/.zshrc` file with a text editor. If you use `nano`, you can do it like this:

```bash
nano ~/.zshrc
```

3. Add your export at the end of the file:

```bash
export JBOSS_HOME=/Users/{USERNAME}/Desktop/jboss7
```

4. Save and close the file. If you're using `nano`, you can do this by pressing `Ctrl + X`, then `Y` to confirm that you want to save the changes, and then `Enter` to confirm the file name.
5. Source the `~/.zshrc` file to apply the changes immediately:

```bash
source ~/.zshrc
```

Now, when you execute `echo $JBOSS_HOME`, you should see the path you set.
