The `~/.bashrc` file is not sourced when a Docker container is run because Docker containers do not start interactive or login shells by default, which are the types of shells that would source `~/.bashrc`.

To ensure that the `nvm` environment is properly set up, you can source the `nvm.sh` script directly in your `launch.sh` script. Here's how you can modify your `launch.sh`:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Source nvm
export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm"
[ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"

cd /workspace/demo
npm install
node index.js
```

This way, the `nvm` environment is set up each time your `launch.sh` script is run, ensuring that `node` and `npm` are available.
