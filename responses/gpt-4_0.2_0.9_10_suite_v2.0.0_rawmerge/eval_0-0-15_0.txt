Sure, the issue is that you are mocking the API class as an object, but then trying to instantiate it as a class. You should mock it as a class instead. Here's how you can do it:

```javascript
import API from 'utils/API';

jest.mock('utils/API', () => {
  return jest.fn().mockImplementation(() => {
    return {someMethod: () => {}};
  });
});
```

In this revised version, `jest.fn().mockImplementation()` is used to mock the API class. It returns a new instance of the mock API class whenever it's instantiated with the `new` keyword.
