Sure, you can achieve this by checking if the string contains `_` and then using the `split` function accordingly. Here is the function `splitOne`:

```python
def splitOne(s):
    if '_' in s:
        return s.split('_', 1)[1]
    else:
        return s
```

This function works as follows:

- If the string `s` contains `_`, it splits the string at the first `_` and returns everything after it.
- If the string `s` does not contain `_`, it returns the string as it is.

The `split` function with the second argument as `1` splits the string at the first occurrence of `_`. The `[1]` at the end of the `split` function is used to get the second part of the split string.

You can use this function like this:

```python
print(splitOne('testing_abc_bbc'))  # abc_bbc
print(splitOne('xyz'))  # xyz
print(splitOne('testing_abc'))  # abc
```
