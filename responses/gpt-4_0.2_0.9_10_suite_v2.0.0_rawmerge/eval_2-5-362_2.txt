The error message you're seeing is due to the fact that Spring Cloud 2020.0.2 (aka Ilford) is designed to work with Spring Boot 2.4.x, which introduced a new way to import configurations using the `spring.config.import` property.

Even though your project is not a ConfigServer and you have commented out the ConfigClient, the `spring-cloud-starter-config` dependency is still in your `build.gradle` file. This starter brings in the ConfigClient, which is expecting the `spring.config.import` property to be set.

If you're not using the ConfigServer or ConfigClient, you can simply remove the `spring-cloud-starter-config` dependency from your `build.gradle` file:

```groovy
// Remove this line
// implementation('org.springframework.cloud:spring-cloud-starter-config')
```

If you are using the ConfigClient, but just not in this particular test, you can disable it for the test by adding the following property:

```java
@SpringBootTest(
    webEnvironment = WebEnvironment.RANDOM_PORT,
    classes = {
        ProductCompositeServiceApplication.class,
        TestSecurityConfig.class },
    properties = {
        "spring.main.allow-bean-definition-overriding=true",
        "spring.cloud.config.enabled=false" }) // Add this line
```

This will disable the ConfigClient for this test, and you should no longer see the error about `spring.config.import` not being set.
