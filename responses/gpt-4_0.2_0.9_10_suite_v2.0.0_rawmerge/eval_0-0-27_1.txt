The code you provided seems correct and should work as expected. However, there are a few things you could check to troubleshoot the issue:

1. **Network Connection**: Ensure your device or emulator has a proper internet connection. Apollo Client fetches data over the network, so a lack of connectivity could be the issue.

2. **Server Status**: Check if the server at `https://48p1r2roz4.sse.codesandbox.io` is up and running. You can do this by visiting the URL in a web browser.

3. **GraphQL Query**: Test your GraphQL query in a tool like GraphQL Playground or GraphiQL to ensure it's correct and the server responds as expected.

4. **Apollo Client Version**: There might be compatibility issues with the version of Apollo Client you're using. Try downgrading to a lower version to see if the problem persists.

5. **React Native Version**: You're using React Native version `0.68.1`, which doesn't exist at the time of writing this. The latest version is `0.67.2`. Please check your React Native version.

6. **Error Handling**: You're logging the `error` object directly, which might not give you useful information. Try logging `error.message` instead to get a more descriptive error message.

7. **React Native Debugger**: If you're using React Native Debugger, make sure Network Inspect is enabled. This will allow you to see the network request made by Apollo Client and check if it's successful or not.

If none of these steps help, please provide more information about your development environment, such as the version of Node.js you're using, the platform you're testing on (iOS or Android), and any error messages you're seeing in your console or debugger.
