The error message `Error: Invalid login: 535-5.7.8 Username and Password not accepted` indicates that the username and password you provided in your `auth` object are not being accepted by Gmail.

Here are a few things you can try to fix this issue:

1. **Check your credentials**: Make sure the email address and password you provided are correct. Remember that passwords are case sensitive.

2. **Enable Less Secure Apps**: By default, Google blocks attempts to sign in from apps which do not use modern security standards (like the Node.js Nodemailer). You can change this by enabling the 'Less secure apps' option in your Gmail account. Here is how to do it:

   - Go to your Google Account.
   - On the left navigation panel, click Security.
   - On the bottom of the page, in the Less secure app access panel, click Turn on access.
   - If you don't see this setting, your administrator might have turned off less secure app account access.

3. **Use App Passwords**: If you have 2-Step Verification enabled for your account, you need to use an App Password instead of your regular password. Here is how to generate an App Password:

   - Go to your Google Account.
   - On the left navigation panel, click Security.
   - On the "Signing in to Google" panel, click App Passwords. If you don’t see this option, 2-Step Verification is not set up for your account, or set up for security keys only.
   - At the bottom, click Select app and choose the app you’re using.
   - Click Select device and choose the device you’re using.
   - Click Generate.
   - Follow the instructions to enter the App Password. The App Password is the 16-character code in the yellow bar on your device.
   - Click Done.

Once you have done this, replace the password in your `auth` object with the App Password you generated.

Remember to never share your passwords or App Passwords with anyone.
