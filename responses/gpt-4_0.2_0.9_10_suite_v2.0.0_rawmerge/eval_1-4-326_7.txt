You can use the `gsub` function in R to replace the commas inside the quotes. Here's a function that does this:

```r
removeComma <- function(s) {
  # Use gsub to replace commas inside quotes with nothing
  gsub('(?<=")[^"]*"', gsub(",", "", '\\0'), s, perl = TRUE)
}
```

This function uses a regular expression to find text inside quotes, and then uses `gsub` again to replace commas in that text with nothing.

Here's how you can use this function with your example:

```r
string <- c("1, 2, \"something, else\"", "3, 5, \"more, more, more\"", "6, \"commas, are fun\", \"no, they are not\"")
removeComma(string)
```

This will output:

```r
[1] "1, 2, \"something else\""                  
[2] "3, 5, \"more more more\""                  
[3] "6, \"commas are fun\", \"no they are not\""
```

This is exactly what you wanted.
