To create a calendar input in VBA Excel, you can use the `Application.InputBox` method with `Type:=8` to prompt the user to select a date from the calendar. Here's a simple example:

```vba
Sub GetDate()
    Dim DateValue As Date
    On Error Resume Next
    DateValue = Application.InputBox(Prompt:="Please select a date.", Type:=8)
    On Error GoTo 0
    If DateValue <> 0 Then
        MsgBox "You selected: " & DateValue
    End If
End Sub
```

In this code, `Type:=8` prompts the user to select a cell on the sheet. If the cell contains a date, that date is returned. If the user cancels the input box or selects a cell that doesn't contain a date, a zero is returned.

Please note that this method doesn't actually display a calendar. It just allows the user to select a cell that contains a date. If you want to display an actual calendar, you might need to use a form with a `MonthView` or `DatePicker` control, but these controls are not available in all versions of Excel.
