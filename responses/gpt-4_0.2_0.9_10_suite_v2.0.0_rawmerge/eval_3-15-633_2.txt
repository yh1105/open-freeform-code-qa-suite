Yes, you can achieve the same result using an array formula with `INDEX` and `SMALL` functions. Here's how you can do it:

```excel
=IFERROR(INDEX($B$1:$B$100, SMALL(IF($A$1:$A$100="x", ROW($A$1:$A$100)-MIN(ROW($A$1:$A$100))+1, ""), ROW(A1))), "")
```

This is an array formula, so you need to press `Ctrl+Shift+Enter` after typing it, instead of just `Enter`.

This formula will return the values from `Column B` where `Column A` has a value of `x`. If there are no more values, it will return an empty string.

Please replace `$B$1:$B$100` and `$A$1:$A$100` with your actual range.

If you want to use a VBA macro, you can use the following code:

```vba
Sub FilterData()
    Dim rng As Range
    Dim outputCol As Range
    Dim cell As Range
    Dim i As Integer

    Set rng = Worksheets("Sheet1").Range("A1:A100")
    Set outputCol = Worksheets("Sheet1").Range("C1")
    i = 0

    For Each cell In rng
        If cell.Value = "x" Then
            outputCol.Offset(i, 0).Value = cell.Offset(0, 1).Value
            i = i + 1
        End If
    Next cell
End Sub
```

This macro will copy the values from `Column B` to `Column C` where `Column A` has a value of `x`. Please replace `"Sheet1"`, `"A1:A100"`, and `"C1"` with your actual sheet name and range.
