You can use the `-split` operator in PowerShell to split the string at the `-354` sequence and then take the first part. Here's how you can do it:

```powershell
$FileArray = @("Name1-354-03.pdf", "Name23-354-H11.pdf", "Name354-354-02.pdf", "Name3545-354.pdf")
ForEach ($n in $FileArray){
     $split = $n -split '-354', 2
     Write-Host ($split[0] + "-354")
}
```

In this script, `-split '-354', 2` splits the string into two parts at the `-354` sequence. The `2` indicates that it should make at most 2 substrings. The first substring (`$split[0]`) is everything before `-354`, and then we append `-354` back to it.

This will give you the output you want:

```
Name1-354
Name23-354
Name354-354
Name3545-354
```
