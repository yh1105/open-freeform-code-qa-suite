You can use `jq` command-line JSON processor to minify JSON in a shell script. `jq` is a lightweight and flexible command-line JSON processor. It is like `sed` for JSON data.

Here is how you can do it:

```bash
echo '{
    "foo": "lorem",
    "bar": "ipsum"
}' | jq -c .
```

This will output:

```bash
{"foo":"lorem","bar":"ipsum"}
```

In the above command, `jq -c .` means "compact output" (`-c`) and "take the input as is" (`.`).

If you don't have `jq` installed, you can install it using the package manager for your system:

- On Ubuntu: `sudo apt-get install jq`
- On MacOS: `brew install jq`
- On Windows (using Chocolatey): `choco install jq`
