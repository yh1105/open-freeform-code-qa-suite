Your code is almost correct, but there are a few issues. 

1. You are trying to use `query` and `currentSheet` as objects, but you are assigning them string values. 
2. You are trying to use `query.Name` but `query` is a string, not an object. 
3. You are trying to use `ActiveSheet.ListObjects.Add` but `ActiveSheet` is a string, not an object.

Here is a corrected version of your code:

```vba
Sub LoadToWorksheetOnly()

    Dim query As String
    Dim currentSheet As Worksheet

    ' Get the query from Sheet6 cell A1
    query = Sheets("Sheet6").Range("A1").Value 

    ' Get the current active sheet
    Set currentSheet = ActiveSheet

    ' Add a new ListObject with a QueryTable that uses the Power Query connection string
    With currentSheet.ListObjects.Add(SourceType:=0, Source:= _
        "OLEDB;Provider=Microsoft.Mashup.OleDb.1;Data Source=$Workbook$;Location=" & query _
        , Destination:=Sheets("target").Range("$A$1")).QueryTable
        .CommandType = xlCmdDefault
        .CommandText = Array("SELECT * FROM [" & query & "]")
        .RowNumbers = False
        .FillAdjacentFormulas = False
        .PreserveFormatting = True
        .RefreshOnFileOpen = False
        .BackgroundQuery = True
        .RefreshStyle = xlInsertDeleteCells
        .SavePassword = False
        .SaveData = True
        .AdjustColumnWidth = True
        .RefreshPeriod = 0
        .PreserveColumnInfo = False
        .Refresh BackgroundQuery:=False
    End With

End Sub
```

This code will get the query from cell A1 on Sheet6, get the current active sheet, and then add a new ListObject with a QueryTable that uses the Power Query connection string to the target sheet. The QueryTable will then be populated with the results of the query.
