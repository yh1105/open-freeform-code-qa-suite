You can change the color of the accordion arrow by targeting the `::after` pseudo-element of the `.accordion-button` class. This is because Bootstrap uses this pseudo-element to create the arrow. Here is an example of how to do this:

```css
.accordion-button::after {
    /* You may want to include !important to override Bootstrap's styles */
    color: green !important; 
}
```

This will change the color of the arrow to green. You can replace `green` with any color you want.

Please note that this will change the color of the arrow for all accordion buttons. If you want to change the color for a specific button, you should add a custom class or id to that button and replace `.accordion-button` with your custom class or id in the CSS rule.
