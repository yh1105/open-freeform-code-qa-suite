Here is a Python function that uses regular expressions to solve the problem:

```python
import re

def to_camel_case(text):
    # Split the string into words
    words = re.split('-|_', text)
    # Capitalize the first letter of each word except the first one
    # and join them together.
    return words[0] + ''.join(word.capitalize() for word in words[1:])
```

This function works by first splitting the input string into words at each dash or underscore. It then capitalizes the first letter of each word except the first one, and joins them together to form the camel case string.

This function preserves the capitalization of the first word in the input string, as required by the problem statement. If the first word was originally capitalized, it will remain capitalized in the output string. If it was not capitalized, it will not be capitalized in the output string.

This function also handles the case where the input string is empty. If the input string is empty, the function will return an empty string.
