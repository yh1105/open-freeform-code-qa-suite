The `myprogram-0.0.1-plain.jar` file is generated by the `bootJar` task in Spring Boot 2.5.0. If you don't want this file, you can disable the `bootJar` task in your `build.gradle` file like this:

```groovy
bootJar {
    enabled = false
}
```

This will prevent the `bootJar` task from running, so the `myprogram-0.0.1-plain.jar` file will not be generated.

However, please note that the `bootJar` task is responsible for creating an executable jar file with embedded dependencies. If you disable this task, the `myprogram-0.0.1.jar` file will not be an executable jar file. If you want to create an executable jar file without the `myprogram-0.0.1-plain.jar` file, you can configure the `jar` task to create an executable jar file like this:

```groovy
jar {
    enabled = true
    manifest {
        attributes 'Main-Class': 'com.example.MainClass'
    }
    from {
        configurations.runtimeClasspath.collect { it.isDirectory() ? it : zipTree(it) }
    }
}
```

Replace `'com.example.MainClass'` with the fully qualified name of your main class.
