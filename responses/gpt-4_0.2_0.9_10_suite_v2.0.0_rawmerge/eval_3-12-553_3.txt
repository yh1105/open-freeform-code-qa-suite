The error message indicates that your Flutter project is not using AndroidX. AndroidX is a major improvement to the original Android Support Library, which is no longer maintained. It provides parity across all devices running Android 9 (API level 28) and later.

To migrate your Flutter project to AndroidX, follow these steps:

1. First, you need to make sure you have Android Studio 3.2 or later. You can download it from the [official website](https://developer.android.com/studio).

2. Open your Flutter project in Android Studio.

3. Go to `Android` -> `Migrate to AndroidX` in the menu.

4. It will analyze your project and display a Refactoring Preview. Click `Do Refactor` at the bottom.

5. A dialog will pop up and show you all the changes that will be made. Click `Migrate` and Android Studio will update your project to use the AndroidX libraries.

6. Finally, make sure to test your app thoroughly to ensure that everything still works as expected.

If you still encounter issues after migrating to AndroidX, it might be due to some dependencies in your project not being compatible with AndroidX. In that case, you will need to update those dependencies to the latest versions that support AndroidX.

Also, make sure you have the latest version of Flutter SDK and Dart SDK installed. You can update them by running `flutter upgrade` and `dart upgrade` in your terminal.

After migrating to AndroidX, you should be able to build your Android app bundle without any issues.
