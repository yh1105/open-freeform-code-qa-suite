The error message indicates that the package `aws-sdk-js` cannot be found in the npm registry. This is because there is no package with that exact name in the npm registry.

If you are trying to install the AWS SDK for JavaScript in Node.js, the correct package name is `aws-sdk`, not `aws-sdk-js`. 

You should run the following command:

```bash
npm install --save aws-sdk
```

This will install the AWS SDK for JavaScript and add it to your `package.json` file.
