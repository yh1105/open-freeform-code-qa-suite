The error message you're seeing suggests that your current PHP version, PHP extensions, or Composer version are not compatible with Laravel 9.

Here are the steps you should follow to troubleshoot this issue:

1. **Check your PHP version**: Laravel 9 requires PHP 7.3 or higher. You can check your PHP version by running `php -v` in your terminal. If your PHP version is lower than 7.3, you need to upgrade it.

2. **Check your PHP extensions**: Laravel 9 requires the following PHP extensions: BCMath, Ctype, Fileinfo, JSON, Mbstring, OpenSSL, PDO, Tokenizer, and XML. You can check your installed extensions by running `php -m` in your terminal. If any of these extensions are missing, you need to install them.

3. **Check your Composer version**: Although you've mentioned that you've updated Composer to version 2.3.10, it's worth double-checking. Run `composer --version` in your terminal to confirm. If your Composer version is lower than 2.0, you need to upgrade it.

4. **Clear Composer's cache**: Sometimes, Composer's cache can cause problems. You can clear it by running `composer clear-cache` in your terminal.

If you've checked all of these and you're still having problems, it's possible that Laravel 9 has not been released yet. At the time of writing this response, the latest stable version of Laravel is 8. You can check the latest version of Laravel by visiting the [Laravel GitHub repository](https://github.com/laravel/laravel) or the [Packagist website](https://packagist.org/packages/laravel/laravel).
