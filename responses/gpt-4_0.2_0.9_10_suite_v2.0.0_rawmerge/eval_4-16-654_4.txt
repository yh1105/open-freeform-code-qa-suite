You can add your SSH key to Git Bash by using the `ssh-add` command. However, before you can use `ssh-add`, you need to start the `ssh-agent` in the background.

Here are the steps:

1. Start Git Bash.
2. Start the ssh-agent in the background:

```bash
eval $(ssh-agent -s)
```

3. Add your SSH private key to the ssh-agent:

```bash
ssh-add /d/keys/your_key
```

Replace `your_key` with the name of your private key file.

If you generated your SSH key using Puttygen, it's likely in a `.ppk` format which is not compatible with `ssh-add`. You need to convert it to OpenSSH format:

1. Open Puttygen.
2. Click 'Load' and select your `.ppk` private key.
3. Once loaded, go to 'Conversions' from the menu and select 'Export OpenSSH key'.
4. Save the new OpenSSH key and use this with `ssh-add`.

Please note that you need to run these commands every time you open a new Git Bash session. If you want to automatically load keys into the ssh-agent and store passphrases in your keychain, you can use a `~/.ssh/config` file.
