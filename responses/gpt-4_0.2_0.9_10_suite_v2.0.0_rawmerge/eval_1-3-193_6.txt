The error message you're seeing is because Selenium can't locate the Firefox binary on your system. This could be due to a few reasons:

1. Firefox is not installed on your system.
2. Firefox is installed, but not in the default location that Selenium is looking in.

Here are a few things you can do to resolve this issue:

1. **Install Firefox**: If Firefox is not installed on your system, you should install it.

2. **Provide the path to Firefox binary**: If Firefox is installed but not in the default location, you need to provide the path to the Firefox binary in your script. Here's how you can do it:

```python
from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.firefox.service import Service
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By
from selenium.webdriver.firefox.options import Options
from selenium.webdriver.common.keys import Keys
from webdriver_manager.firefox import GeckoDriverManager

options = Options()
options.binary_location = "/path/to/your/firefox/binary" # replace with your path
driver = webdriver.Firefox(service=Service(GeckoDriverManager().install()), options=options)
driver.get('http://www.seleniumhq.org')
```

Replace `"/path/to/your/firefox/binary"` with the actual path to your Firefox binary.

3. **Use WebDriver Manager**: WebDriver Manager can help to manage driver related settings automatically. Here's how you can use it:

```python
from selenium import webdriver
from webdriver_manager.firefox import GeckoDriverManager

driver = webdriver.Firefox(executable_path=GeckoDriverManager().install())
driver.get('http://www.seleniumhq.org')
```

This will automatically download the latest compatible Firefox driver and use it.

Remember to install WebDriver Manager using pip:

```
pip install webdriver_manager
```
