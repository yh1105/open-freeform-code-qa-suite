The `EINTEGRITY` error is a checksum error that occurs when the package's checksum in the `npm` registry does not match the calculated checksum on your machine. This could be due to a variety of reasons, such as a faulty network connection, a problem with the npm cache, or a problem with the package itself.

Here are some steps you can take to resolve this issue:

1. **Clear the npm cache:** The npm cache might be corrupted, so clearing it could solve the problem. You can do this by running the command `npm cache clean --force`.

2. **Delete the `node_modules` directory and the `package-lock.json` file:** Sometimes, the problem might be with the `node_modules` directory or the `package-lock.json` file. Deleting these and running `npm install` again might solve the problem. Here are the commands to do this:

    ```bash
    rm -rf node_modules
    rm package-lock.json
    npm install
    ```

3. **Update npm:** The problem might be with npm itself. Updating npm to the latest version might solve the problem. You can update npm by running the command `npm install -g npm@latest`.

4. **Check your network connection:** A faulty network connection might cause the checksums to not match. If you're on a corporate network, you might be behind a proxy or firewall that's interfering with `npm`. If possible, try a different network connection and see if the problem persists.

5. **Check the package:** If the problem persists, it might be with the package itself. You could try installing a different version of the package, or contact the package maintainer for help.

Remember to always back up your work before making any major changes.
