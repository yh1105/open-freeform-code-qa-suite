You are trying to filter the DataFrame before grouping, which is a bit different in pandas than in SQL. Here's how you can do it:

```python
data_useless[data_useless['TEST_STATUS'] == 'PASS TEST'].groupby('TEST_STATUS').count()
```

This code first filters the DataFrame to only include rows where `TEST_STATUS` is `PASS TEST`, and then groups by `TEST_STATUS` and counts the number of occurrences.

If you want to see the count for each `TEST_TYPE` within the `PASS TEST` status, you can do:

```python
data_useless[data_useless['TEST_STATUS'] == 'PASS TEST'].groupby('TEST_TYPE').count()
```

This will give you a count of each `TEST_TYPE` within the `PASS TEST` status.
