The error you're seeing is because the `pdftk` binary you're trying to run is not compatible with your CPU architecture. This is a common issue on MacOS Catalina and later versions because Apple has dropped support for 32-bit applications.

Here's how you can solve this issue:

1. Uninstall the current version of `pdftk` you have installed.

    ```bash
    brew uninstall pdftk
    ```

2. Install `pdftk-java` which is a reimplementation of `pdftk` in Java.

    ```bash
    brew install pdftk-java
    ```

3. Create a symbolic link to `pdftk-java` so you can use `pdftk` command.

    ```bash
    echo 'alias pdftk="/usr/local/bin/pdftk-java"' >> ~/.zshrc
    ```

4. Source your `.zshrc` to apply the changes.

    ```bash
    source ~/.zshrc
    ```

Now you should be able to use `pdftk` command in your terminal.

Please note that `pdftk-java` requires Java Runtime Environment (JRE) to run. If you don't have it installed, you can install it using Homebrew:

```bash
brew cask install adoptopenjdk
```
