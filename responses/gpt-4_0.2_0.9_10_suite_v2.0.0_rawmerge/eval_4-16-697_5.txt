The `~/.bashrc` file is not sourced when a non-interactive shell is started, which is the case when a Docker container is run. 

To solve your issue, you can source the `~/.bashrc` file in your `launch.sh` script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

source ~/.bashrc

cd /workspace/demo
npm install
node index.js
```

Or, you can directly source the `nvm.sh` script in your `launch.sh` script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

source $NVM_DIR/nvm.sh

cd /workspace/demo
npm install
node index.js
```

Either of these changes should allow your Docker container to find the `node` and `npm` commands.
