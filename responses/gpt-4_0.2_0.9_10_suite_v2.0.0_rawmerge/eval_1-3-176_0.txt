The error message indicates that the zlib library, which is a required dependency for Pillow, could not be found. 

However, the Pillow version you are trying to install (6.0.0) does not support Python 3.8, which you are using. This is mentioned in the error message:

```bash
C:\Users\rijal\AppData\Local\Temp\pip-install-di5is9gd\Pillow\setup.py:29: RuntimeWarning: Pillow does not yet support Python 3.8 and does not yet provide prebuilt Windows binaries. We do not recommend building from source on Windows.
```

You should try to install a more recent version of Pillow that supports Python 3.8. You can do this by simply running:

```bash
pip install pillow
```

This command will automatically install the latest version of Pillow.

If you still encounter issues, you might want to consider using a Python version that is fully supported by the Pillow version you are trying to install. For example, as of Pillow 6.0.0, the latest supported Python version is 3.7.
