Sure, you can use the `last:` variant provided by Tailwind CSS to apply styles to the last element of a container. In your case, you can use the `last:border-b-0` class to remove the bottom border from the last `<li>` element.

Here is your revised code:

```html
<ul>
  <li
    v-for="(item, index) in items"
    :key="`item-${index}`"
    class="border-solid border-b border-black last:border-b-0"
  >
    Item
  </li>
</ul>
```

This code will apply a bottom border to all `<li>` elements except the last one.

Please note that by default, the `last` variant is not enabled for any utilities. You need to enable it in your Tailwind CSS configuration file (`tailwind.config.js`) like this:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  variants: {
    extend: {
      borderWidth: ['last'],
    }
  }
}
```

After you've done this, you should be able to use the `last:` variant as shown in the HTML code above.
