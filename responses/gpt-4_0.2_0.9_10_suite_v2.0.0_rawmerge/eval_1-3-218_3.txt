You can use the `str.replace` function in pandas to replace the special characters with an empty string. Here is a function `remove` that does this:

```python
import pandas as pd

def remove(df):
    df['LGA'] = df['LGA'].str.replace(r'\(.*\)', '')
    return df
```

This function uses a regular expression to match any characters between parentheses and replace them with an empty string. The `.*` in the regular expression matches any character (except a newline) 0 or more times. The `\(` and `\)` escape the parentheses, so they are treated as literal characters rather than special regex characters.

You can call this function on your DataFrame like this:

```python
df = remove(df)
```

After running this, the 'LGA' column in `df` will have all characters between parentheses removed.
