Sure, the problem is that you're mocking the `API` class as an object, but then trying to use it as a class. You should mock it as a class instead. Here's how you can do it:

```javascript
import API from 'utils/API';

jest.mock('utils/API', () => {
  return jest.fn().mockImplementation(() => {
    return {someMethod: () => {}};
  });
});
```

In this way, `API` is mocked as a class with a constructor, and `new API()` will not throw an error.
