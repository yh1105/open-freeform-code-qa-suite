The error message "Failed to clear cache. Make sure you have the appropriate permissions." suggests that the user running the `php artisan cache:clear` command doesn't have the necessary permissions to delete the files in the cache directory.

This could be due to a few reasons:

1. The user running the command doesn't own the cache files. This could happen if the cache files were created by a different user.

2. The permissions on the cache directory or the files within it don't allow the user to delete files. 

You can check the ownership and permissions of the cache directory and its files using the `ls -l` command in the terminal. If the permissions are incorrect, you can change them using the `chown` command to change the owner and the `chmod` command to change the permissions.

For example, if your cache directory is located at `/path/to/your/project/bootstrap/cache`, you can change the owner to your user (replace `youruser` with your actual username) and set the permissions to allow the owner to read, write, and execute files with the following commands:

```bash
sudo chown -R youruser /path/to/your/project/bootstrap/cache
sudo chmod -R 755 /path/to/your/project/bootstrap/cache
```

Please replace `/path/to/your/project` with the actual path to your Laravel project.

Remember to be careful when changing ownership and permissions, as incorrect settings can cause security issues.
