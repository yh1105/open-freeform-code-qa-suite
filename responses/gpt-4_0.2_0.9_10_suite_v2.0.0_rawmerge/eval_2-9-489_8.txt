The warning you're seeing is because Elasticsearch 7.13.1 has built-in security features that are not enabled by default. This means that without authentication, your Elasticsearch cluster could be accessible to anyone.

To fix this, you need to enable Elasticsearch's built-in security features. Here's how you can do it:

1. Open your `elasticsearch.yml` configuration file. This file is typically located in the `/etc/elasticsearch` or `/usr/local/etc/elasticsearch` directory.

2. Add the following lines to the file:

    ```yaml
    xpack.security.enabled: true
    xpack.security.transport.ssl.enabled: true
    ```

3. Save the file and restart Elasticsearch.

Please note that enabling security will require all users to authenticate. You'll need to create user credentials and update your application's Elasticsearch client configuration accordingly.

If you don't want to enable Elasticsearch's built-in security features, you can suppress this warning by adding the following line to your `elasticsearch.yml` file:

```yaml
xpack.security.enabled: false
```

Again, save the file and restart Elasticsearch.

Remember that this will leave your Elasticsearch cluster unprotected, which could be a security risk depending on your use case.

If you're using Elasticsearch for development purposes only and your cluster is not exposed to the internet, it might be acceptable to leave security disabled. However, for production use, it's strongly recommended to enable security.
