It seems like you're missing the `libffi` library, which is a dependency for the `travis-cli` gem. You can install it using Homebrew.

First, you need to install Homebrew if you haven't already. You can install it by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

After installing Homebrew, you can install `libffi` by running:

```bash
brew install libffi
```

Once `libffi` is installed, you need to set the `PKG_CONFIG_PATH` environment variable to point to the `libffi` package configuration file. You can do this by adding the following line to your shell profile file (`~/.bashrc`, `~/.bash_profile`, `~/.zshrc`, etc.):

```bash
export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/usr/local/opt/libffi/lib/pkgconfig"
```

Then, source your shell profile file. For example, if you added the line to `~/.bashrc`, you would run:

```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```

Now you should be able to install the `travis-cli` gem without any issues:

```bash
gem install travis
```
