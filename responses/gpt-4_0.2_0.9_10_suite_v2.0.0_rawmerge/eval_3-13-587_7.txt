The error message you're seeing is related to the Java version you're using. The `java.lang.Module` class was introduced in Java 9, and it seems like your project is trying to use it but can't find it, which suggests that you're using a version of Java that's older than Java 9.

Here are a few steps you can take to resolve this issue:

1. **Check your Java version:** You can do this by running `java -version` in your terminal. If the version is less than 9, you'll need to update it.

2. **Update your Java version:** If you're using a version of Java that's older than 9, you'll need to update it. You can download the latest version of Java from the [official Oracle website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html).

3. **Update your `JAVA_HOME` environment variable:** After installing a new version of Java, you'll need to update your `JAVA_HOME` environment variable to point to the new installation. The process for doing this varies depending on your operating system.

4. **Check your Gradle settings:** Make sure that Gradle is using the correct version of Java. You can do this by checking the `org.gradle.java.home` property in your `gradle.properties` file. If this property is set, it should point to the location of your Java installation.

5. **Update Jacoco version:** The version of Jacoco you're using might not be compatible with the new versions of Gradle and Kotlin. Try updating Jacoco to the latest version.

If you've done all of the above and you're still seeing the error, it might be a bug in one of the tools you're using. In that case, you might want to consider filing a bug report with the relevant project.
