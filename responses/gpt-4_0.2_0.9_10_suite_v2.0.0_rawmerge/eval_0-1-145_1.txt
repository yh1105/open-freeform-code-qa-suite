The `truncate` class in Tailwind CSS only works for single line text. It sets `overflow: hidden`, `text-overflow: ellipsis` and `white-space: nowrap`. 

If you want to truncate text that spans multiple lines, you will need to use some additional CSS. Unfortunately, Tailwind CSS does not support multiline text truncation out of the box.

Here is a CSS solution that you can use:

```css
.truncate-2-lines {
  display: -webkit-box;
  -webkit-line-clamp: 2;
  -webkit-box-orient: vertical;  
  overflow: hidden;
  text-overflow: ellipsis;
}
```

Then you can use this class in your HTML:

```html
<div className="ml-1 inline-block">
   <span>Label: </span>
   <span className="font-semibold truncate-2-lines">
     long texttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttt
   </span>
</div>
```

This will truncate the text after 2 lines. You can adjust the number of lines by changing the `-webkit-line-clamp` property.

Please note that this solution uses `-webkit-` prefixed properties, which means it will not work in non-WebKit browsers like Firefox. For a cross-browser solution, you might need to use JavaScript or a library that provides multiline truncation.
