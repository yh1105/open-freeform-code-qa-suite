The `SelectByID2` method requires you to know the name of the entity you want to select. If you are trying to select a face or an edge, these entities usually don't have a name unless you manually assign one.

Here is a simple way to create a reference plane using a face and a point:

1. Select the face and the point using the `Select4` method. This method allows you to select entities directly without knowing their names.

```vba
faceObj.Select4(True, Nothing)
midpointObj.Select4(True, Nothing)
```

2. Use the `InsertRefPlane` method to create a reference plane using the selected entities.

```vba
swFeatMgr.InsertRefPlane(3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0)
```

The `InsertRefPlane` method creates a reference plane using the entities that are currently selected in the model. The first argument specifies the type of reference plane to create. In this case, `3` means to create a plane using a face and a point.

Here is how you can modify your code:

```vba
' Select the face and the point
faceObj.Select4 True, Nothing
midpointObj.Select4 True, Nothing

' Create a reference plane using the selected face and point
swFeatMgr.InsertRefPlane 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
```

This should create a reference plane using the selected face and point.
