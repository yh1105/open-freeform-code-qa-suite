The error message indicates that Go is unable to find the specified version of the module. This could be due to a number of reasons, such as network issues, incorrect version specified in `go.mod`, or issues with access to the private repository.

Here are a few steps you can take to debug this issue:

1. **Check your network connection**: Ensure that you have a stable internet connection and that you can access the repository URL from your browser or via a `git clone` command.

2. **Check the version specified in `go.mod`**: Make sure that the version of the module specified in your `go.mod` file is correct and exists in the repository. You can check this by visiting the repository URL and checking the list of tags or releases.

3. **Check access to the private repository**: If the repository is private, you need to ensure that you have the necessary access rights. You mentioned that you have access to the repository, but you might want to double-check this. Also, ensure that your `git` client is correctly configured to use your credentials when accessing the repository.

4. **Try to download the module manually**: You can try to download the module manually using the `go get` command. This might give you more detailed error messages that can help you debug the issue.

    ```bash
    go get github.ibm.com/kms/key-protect-client@v0.1.5
    ```

5. **Check your Go version**: Make sure you're using a version of Go that supports the version of the module you're trying to use. You can check your Go version with `go version`.

6. **Check your GOPROXY settings**: If you're using a Go module proxy (which is the default in recent versions of Go), make sure it's correctly configured. You can check your current GOPROXY setting with `go env GOPROXY`. If you're behind a corporate firewall, you might need to configure this to use a proxy server.

7. **Clear your Go module cache**: Sometimes, issues can be caused by a corrupted module cache. You can clear your module cache with `go clean -modcache`.

If none of these steps help, you might want to consider asking for help on the Go community forums or on Stack Overflow. Be sure to include as much information as possible about your setup and the exact error message you're seeing.
