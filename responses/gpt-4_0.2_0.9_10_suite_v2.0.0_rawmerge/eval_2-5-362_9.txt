The error message indicates that the Spring Cloud Config Client is active in your application, even though you mentioned that you're not using it. The `spring-cloud-starter-config` dependency is included in your `build.gradle` file, which activates the Config Client.

If you're not using the Config Server, you should remove the `spring-cloud-starter-config` dependency from your `build.gradle` file:

```groovy
// Remove this line
implementation('org.springframework.cloud:spring-cloud-starter-config')
```

If you still want to keep the dependency for some reason, but don't want to use the Config Server, you can disable it by setting the `spring.cloud.config.enabled` property to `false` in your `application.properties` or `application.yml` file:

```properties
spring.cloud.config.enabled=false
```

Or in your test configuration:

```java
@SpringBootTest(
    webEnvironment = WebEnvironment.RANDOM_PORT,
    classes = {
        ProductCompositeServiceApplication.class,
        TestSecurityConfig.class },
    properties = {
        "spring.main.allow-bean-definition-overriding=true",
        "spring.cloud.config.enabled=false" })
```

This should resolve the error you're seeing.
