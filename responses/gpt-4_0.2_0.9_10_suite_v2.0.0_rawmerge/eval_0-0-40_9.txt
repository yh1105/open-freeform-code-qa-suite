The issue you're facing is due to the fact that your system is trying to use the Windows version of `npm` instead of the one installed in your WSL2 Ubuntu environment. This is because the Windows path is included in your WSL2 path.

To solve this issue, you can remove the Windows path from your WSL2 path. You can do this by editing your `.bashrc` or `.bash_profile` file. Open the file with a text editor like `nano`:

```bash
nano ~/.bashrc
```

Then, add the following line to the end of the file:

```bash
export PATH=$(echo "$PATH" | sed -e 's/:\/mnt.*//g')
```

This command will remove the Windows path from your WSL2 path.

After adding this line, save the file and exit the text editor. Then, run the following command to apply the changes:

```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```

Now, when you run `npm -v`, it should use the `npm` installed in your WSL2 environment. If you still face the same issue, you might need to reinstall `npm` in your WSL2 environment using the following command:

```bash
sudo apt-get install -y npm
```

After the installation, check the version of `npm` again using `npm -v`. It should now display the correct version.
