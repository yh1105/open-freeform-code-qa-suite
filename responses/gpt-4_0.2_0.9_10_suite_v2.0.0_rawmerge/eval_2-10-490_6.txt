Yes, there is a better way to handle this in Rust using the `?` operator. This operator is used for error propagation. When used with `Option<T>`, if the value is `None`, it will return immediately from the function and give `None`. If the value is `Some(v)`, it will give `v`. 

However, you can't use `?` in main function or any other function that doesn't return `Option<T>` or `Result<T, E>`. So, you need to wrap your code in a function that returns `Option<T>`.

Here is how you can refactor your code:

```rust
fn process() -> Option<()> {
    let i = func1()?;
    let j = func2(i)?;
    let k = func3(j)?;
    let result = func4(k)?;

    // Do something with result

    Some(())
}

fn main() {
    if process().is_none() {
        println!("A function returned None");
    }
}
```

In this refactored code, if any of the functions `func1`, `func2`, `func3`, or `func4` returns `None`, the `process` function will immediately return `None` and the error message will be printed. 

This way, the code is much cleaner and easier to read. However, it does lose the ability to specify which function returned `None`. If you need to keep this information, you might need to use `Result<T, E>` instead of `Option<T>` and define an error type that can hold this information.
