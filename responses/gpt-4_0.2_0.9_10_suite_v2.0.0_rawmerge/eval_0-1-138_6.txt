Yes, you can detect if the user's system is in dark mode by using the CSS media feature `prefers-color-scheme`. This feature is used to detect if the user has requested the system use a light or dark color theme.

Here is a basic example:

```css
/* Light mode */
body {
  background-color: white;
  color: black;
}

/* Dark mode */
@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
  body {
    background-color: black;
    color: white;
  }
}
```

In this example, the body of the webpage will be white with black text by default. If the user has set their system to use a dark color theme, the media query will override the default styles, making the body of the webpage black with white text.

This feature is supported in Safari 12.1 and later, Chrome 76 and later, and Firefox 67 and later. However, it's always a good idea to provide a fallback for browsers that do not support this feature.
