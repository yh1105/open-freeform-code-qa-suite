Font Awesome 5 has made some changes in how it is used compared to Font Awesome 4. The `font-family` is no longer just "FontAwesome", it's now separated into different styles like "Font Awesome 5 Free", "Font Awesome 5 Brands", and "Font Awesome 5 Pro". The `content` values have also changed for some icons.

Here's how you can update your code to work with Font Awesome 5:

```css
#mainNav .navbar-collapse .navbar-sidenav .nav-link-collapse:after {
  float: right;
  content: "\f105";
  font-family: "Font Awesome 5 Free";
  font-weight: 900;
}
```

In this example, I've used the unicode for the right angle icon in Font Awesome 5 (`\f105`). You might need to adjust this depending on the specific icon you want to use. Also, note the `font-weight: 900;` line. This is necessary because Font Awesome 5 uses different font weights to distinguish between solid (`900`), regular (`400`), and light (`300`) icons.
