Yes, you can modify the user interface of Firefox by adding custom CSS rules. Here's how you can reduce the spacing between menu items:

1. Open your Firefox profile folder. You can do this by typing `about:support` in the address bar and then clicking on `Open Folder` next to `Profile Folder`.

2. In your profile folder, create a new folder named `chrome` if it doesn't already exist.

3. Inside the `chrome` folder, create a new file named `userChrome.css`. If the file already exists, you can just edit it.

4. Open `userChrome.css` in a text editor and add the following CSS rules:

    ```css
    /* Reduce spacing in menus */
    menupopup > menuitem, menupopup > menu {
        padding-block: 4px !important;
    }

    /* Reduce spacing in context menus */
    .context-menu-item {
        padding-block: 4px !important;
    }
    ```

5. Save the file and restart Firefox.

The `padding-block` property sets the vertical padding (top and bottom) of the menu items. You can adjust the value `4px` to increase or decrease the spacing as per your preference.

Please note that you need to enable the `toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets` setting in `about:config` for these changes to take effect. If you haven't done this before, here's how:

1. Type `about:config` in the address bar and press Enter.

2. Click on `Accept the Risk and Continue`.

3. In the search bar, type `toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets`.

4. If the value is `false`, click on the toggle button to set it to `true`.

5. Restart Firefox.
