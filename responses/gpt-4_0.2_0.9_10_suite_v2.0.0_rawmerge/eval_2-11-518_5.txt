The Rule of 5 is not necessarily outdated, but it's true that modern C++ practices and features like smart pointers can reduce the need for it.

The Rule of 5 is a guideline that helps ensure that you correctly manage dynamic resources. If your class is managing a resource (like raw pointers), you need to ensure that copying and moving the class behaves correctly. This is where the Rule of 5 comes in.

However, you're correct that smart pointers can often eliminate the need for this. A `std::unique_ptr` or `std::shared_ptr` automatically cleans up the resource it points to when it's destroyed. This means you don't need a custom destructor, and since they can't be copied (in the case of `std::unique_ptr`) or automatically handle copying (in the case of `std::shared_ptr`), you don't need custom copy constructors or assignment operators either.

That said, there are still cases where you might need to follow the Rule of 5:

- If you're working with a resource that isn't memory, like a file or a network connection, you can't use a smart pointer to manage it. You'll need to follow the Rule of 5 to correctly manage the resource.
- If you're working with a class that has a raw pointer and you can't change it to use a smart pointer for some reason (like maintaining compatibility with existing code), you'll need to follow the Rule of 5.
- If you need to do something unusual when copying or moving your class, like keep track of how many copies exist, you'll need to follow the Rule of 5.

So while smart pointers and other modern C++ features can reduce the need for the Rule of 5, it's not completely outdated. It's a tool that can be very useful in certain situations.
