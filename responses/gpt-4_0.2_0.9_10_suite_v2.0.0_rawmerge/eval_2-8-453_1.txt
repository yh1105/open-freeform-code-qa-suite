The `err113` linter is complaining because you're creating new error instances in your code with `errors.New()`. This is considered a bad practice because it makes error handling more difficult. Instead, you should define a static error and use that, possibly wrapping it with additional context if needed.

Here's how you can fix your code:

First, define your errors at the package level:

```go
var (
    ErrRepo = errors.New("repo gave err")
    ErrOops = errors.New("oops")
)
```

Then, use these errors in your code:

```go
foo_test.go:55:61: err113: do not define dynamic errors, use wrapped static errors instead: "errors.New(\"repo gave err\")" (goerr113)
        repoMock.EXPECT().Save(gomock.Eq(&foooBarBar)).Return(nil, ErrRepo),
                                                                  ^

foo_test.go:22:42: err113: do not define dynamic errors, use wrapped static errors instead: "errors.New(\"oops\")" (goerr113)
    repoMock.EXPECT().FindAll().Return(nil, ErrOops)
```

If you need to add more context to your errors, you can use `fmt.Errorf()` to wrap your base error:

```go
return nil, fmt.Errorf("additional context: %w", ErrRepo)
```

This way, you can check for errors using `errors.Is()` and `errors.As()`, and you can extract additional context if needed.
