The issue you're experiencing is likely due to Vite's server only being accessible from inside the Docker container. By default, Vite's server only listens on the localhost interface (`127.0.0.1`), which is not accessible from outside the Docker container.

To make the Vite server accessible from outside the Docker container, you need to configure it to listen on all network interfaces (`0.0.0.0`). You can do this by adding the `host` property to the `server` object in your `vite.config.ts` file:

```typescript
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import vue from '@vitejs/plugin-vue'

// https://vitejs.dev/config/
export default defineConfig({
    resolve: { alias: { '@': '/src' } },
    plugins: [vue()],
    server: {
        host: '0.0.0.0',
        port: 8080
    }
})
```

This should allow you to access the Vite server from your host machine via `localhost:8080`.
