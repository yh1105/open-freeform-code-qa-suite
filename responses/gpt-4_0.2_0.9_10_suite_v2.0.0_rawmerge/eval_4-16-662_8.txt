You can use `jq` command-line JSON processor to minify JSON in a shell script. `jq` is a lightweight and flexible command-line JSON processor. It is like `sed` for JSON data - you can use it to slice and filter and map and transform structured data with the same ease that `sed`, `awk`, `grep` and friends let you play with text.

Here is how you can do it:

```bash
echo '{
    "foo": "lorem",
    "bar": "ipsum"
}' | jq -c .
```

This will output:

```bash
{"foo":"lorem","bar":"ipsum"}
```

The `-c` option in `jq` command stands for "compact output". It ensures that the output JSON is in a compact form, without any unnecessary white spaces.

If you don't have `jq` installed, you can install it using the package manager for your system. For example, on Ubuntu you can install it with `sudo apt-get install jq`, and on macOS you can install it with `brew install jq`.
