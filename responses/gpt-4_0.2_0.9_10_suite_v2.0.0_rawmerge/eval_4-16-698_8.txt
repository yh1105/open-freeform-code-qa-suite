You can use the `source` command to reload your `.bash_profile` without closing and reopening your terminal. Here's how you do it:

```bash
source ~/.bash_profile
```

This command will read and execute commands from the filename argument in the current shell context. If you made changes to your `.bash_profile`, those changes will be applied to your current terminal session.

If you're using a different shell, you would source that file instead. For example, if you're using zsh, you would do:

```bash
source ~/.zshrc
```

Please note that this won't "restart" your terminal in the sense of clearing your history or resetting your environment variables to their startup state. It will only apply the changes you made in your `.bash_profile`. If you want to completely restart your terminal session, you would have to close and reopen your terminal.
