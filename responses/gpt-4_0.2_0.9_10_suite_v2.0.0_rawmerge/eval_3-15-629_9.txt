You can use the `MSForms.DataObject` to interact with the clipboard. Here's a simple function to copy text to the clipboard:

```vba
Sub CopyToClipboard(text As String)
    Dim DataObj As MSForms.DataObject
    Set DataObj = New MSForms.DataObject
    DataObj.SetText text
    DataObj.PutInClipboard
End Sub
```

You can use it like this:

```vba
Call CopyToClipboard(Me.NodeKey.Value)
```

Please note that you need to add a reference to `Microsoft Forms 2.0 Object Library` to use `MSForms.DataObject`. You can do this by going to `Tools > References` in the VBA editor, and then checking `Microsoft Forms 2.0 Object Library` from the list.

If you don't see `Microsoft Forms 2.0 Object Library` in the list, you can browse for `FM20.DLL` in your system32 or sysWOW64 folder (usually `C:\Windows\System32\FM20.DLL` or `C:\Windows\SysWOW64\FM20.DLL`).
