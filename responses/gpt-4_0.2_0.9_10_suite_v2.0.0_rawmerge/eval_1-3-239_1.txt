Sure, here is a bash script that will install a specific version of Python using Homebrew:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Unlink current Python
brew unlink python

# Install Python 3.6.5
brew install python@3.6

# Link Python 3.6.5
brew link --force python@3.6
```

Please note that this script will unlink your current Python version and link Python 3.6.5. If you have any other Python versions installed, you may need to adjust the script accordingly.
