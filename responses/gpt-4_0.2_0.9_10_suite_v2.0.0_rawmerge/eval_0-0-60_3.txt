The error message you're seeing is because Bootstrap requires Popper.js for the dropdowns and other interactive components. 

You can install Popper.js via npm by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm install popper.js --save
```

After installing Popper.js, you need to import it in your file:

```javascript
import Popper from 'popper.js';
```

If you're using Bootstrap 4, you can also consider using `@popperjs/core` instead of `popper.js`. You can install it via npm:

```bash
npm install @popperjs/core
```

And then import it in your file:

```javascript
import { createPopper } from '@popperjs/core';
```

Remember to restart your server after installing new dependencies.
