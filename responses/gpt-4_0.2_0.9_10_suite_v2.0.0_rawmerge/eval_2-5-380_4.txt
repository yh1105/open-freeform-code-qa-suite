The issue might be related to the URL you are trying to access. The Swagger UI is not available at `/swagger-ui.html` when using the `springdoc-openapi-ui` library.

Instead, you should be able to access the Swagger UI at the following URL:

```
http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html
```

Or, if you have a context path:

```
http://localhost:8080/{context-path}/swagger-ui/index.html
```

Also, make sure that your Spring Boot application is running and that the port 8080 is the correct one.

If you still can't access the Swagger UI, you might need to check your Spring Boot application's configuration. Make sure that the `springdoc-openapi-ui` library is correctly configured and that there are no conflicts with other libraries or configurations.
