The error message suggests that Selenium can't find the Firefox binary in its default location. This could be due to several reasons:

1. Firefox is not installed on your system.
2. Firefox is installed but not in the default location.

Here are a few solutions you can try:

**Solution 1: Install Firefox**

If Firefox is not installed on your system, you should install it. You can download it from the official Firefox website.

**Solution 2: Specify the Firefox Binary Location**

If Firefox is installed but not in the default location, you can specify the Firefox binary location in your code. Here's how you can do it:

```python
from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.firefox.service import Service
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By
from selenium.webdriver.firefox.options import Options as FirefoxOptions

# specify the path to Firefox binary
firefox_path = '/path/to/your/firefox/binary'

options = FirefoxOptions()
options.binary_location = firefox_path

# specify the path to geckodriver
webdriver_service = Service('/path/to/your/geckodriver')

driver = webdriver.Firefox(service=webdriver_service, options=options)
driver.get('http://www.seleniumhq.org')
```

Replace `'/path/to/your/firefox/binary'` with the actual path to your Firefox binary and `'/path/to/your/geckodriver'` with the actual path to your geckodriver.

**Solution 3: Set the PATH Environment Variable**

Another solution is to add the Firefox binary location to your system's PATH environment variable. This process varies depending on your operating system.

For Windows:

1. Right-click on 'My Computer' and click on 'Properties'.
2. Click on 'Advanced System Settings'.
3. Click on 'Environment Variables'.
4. Under 'System Variables', find the 'Path' variable, select it, and click on 'Edit'.
5. In the 'Variable value' field, append the path to your Firefox binary to the existing value. Make sure to separate it with a semicolon (;).

For Linux/Mac:

1. Open your terminal.
2. Open the `.bashrc` or `.bash_profile` file with a text editor.
3. Add `export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/your/firefox/binary` to the end of the file.
4. Save the file and exit the text editor.
5. Run `source ~/.bashrc` or `source ~/.
