Sure, the problem is that you're mocking the `API` class as an object, not as a class. Here's how you can fix it:

```javascript
import API from 'utils/API';

jest.mock('utils/API', () => {
  return jest.fn().mockImplementation(() => {
    return {someMethod: () => {}};
  });
});
```

In this code, `jest.fn().mockImplementation()` creates a mock function that, when called, will return a new object with the `someMethod` function. This way, you can use `new API()` without getting a `TypeError`.
