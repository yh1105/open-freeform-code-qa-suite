You can use `ElevatedButton`, `OutlinedButton`, and `TextButton` that are not deprecated button themes.
You can change the `shape` property which is placed in the `style` property.

Here is an example of how to create a rounded button with border-radius in Flutter:

```dart
ElevatedButton(
  style: ElevatedButton.styleFrom(
    shape: RoundedRectangleBorder(
      borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(50.0),
    ),
  ),
  onPressed: () {},
  child: Text('Click Me'),
)
```

In this example, `ElevatedButton.styleFrom` is used to create a mutable style from simple values. The `shape` property is used to change the shape of the button, and `RoundedRectangleBorder` with `BorderRadius.circular(50.0)` is used to make the button rounded. The `onPressed` property is where you put the function that will be executed when the button is pressed.
