The `truncate` class in Tailwind CSS only works for single line text. It sets `overflow: hidden`, `text-overflow: ellipsis`, and `white-space: nowrap` on an element. So, if you want to truncate text that spans multiple lines, you'll need to use a different approach.

Unfortunately, Tailwind CSS does not provide a utility for multi-line text truncation out of the box. You would have to use a custom solution for this. Here's an example of how you could do it:

```css
.truncate-2-lines {
  display: -webkit-box;
  -webkit-line-clamp: 2;
  -webkit-box-orient: vertical;  
  overflow: hidden;
  text-overflow: ellipsis;
}
```

Then, you can use this class in your HTML:

```html
<div className="ml-1 inline-block">
   <span>Label: </span>
   <span className="font-semibold truncate-2-lines">
     long texttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttt
   </span>
</div>
```

This will truncate the text after 2 lines. Note that this solution uses `-webkit-line-clamp` which is not supported in all browsers, but it does work in most modern ones.
