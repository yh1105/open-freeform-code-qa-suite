The error you're getting is because you're trying to import the Bootstrap variables file before you define your own `$theme-colors` map. The Bootstrap variables file already contains a definition for `$theme-colors`, and it's used in several places throughout the rest of the Bootstrap SCSS files.

When you import the variables file, it's like you're copying and pasting all of its contents into that spot in your SCSS file. So by the time your `$theme-colors` map is defined, it's too late - the original `$theme-colors` map has already been used.

To fix this, you should define your `$theme-colors` map before importing the Bootstrap SCSS files. Here's how you can do it:

```scss
// Define your own theme colors
$theme-colors: (
  "primary": #your-color-here,
  // Add more colors if needed
);

// Then import Bootstrap
@import "../../node_modules/bootstrap/scss/bootstrap";
```

This way, when the Bootstrap SCSS files are imported, your `$theme-colors` map will be used instead of the default one.
