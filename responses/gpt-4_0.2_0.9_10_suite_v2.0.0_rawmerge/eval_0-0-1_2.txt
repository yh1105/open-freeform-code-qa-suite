It's hard to provide a specific solution without seeing your code, but here are some general steps you can follow to debug and fix the issue:

1. **Check your `package.json` scripts:** Vercel uses the `build` script in your `package.json` to build your application. Make sure it's correctly set to `"build": "next build"`.

2. **Check your dynamic routes:** If you're using dynamic routes, make sure you're using Next.js's file-based routing correctly. For example, a file named `pages/posts/[id].js` will correctly match `posts/1`, `posts/abc`, etc. 

3. **Check your `getStaticPaths` and `getStaticProps` (or `getServerSideProps`):** If you're using dynamic routes, you're likely using `getStaticPaths` and `getStaticProps` (or `getServerSideProps`). Make sure you're returning an object with the correct format from `getStaticPaths`.

4. **Check your custom server (if any):** If you're using a custom server, note that it won't work with Vercel because Vercel only supports Next.js's built-in server. You'll need to refactor your code to not use a custom server.

5. **Check your public directory:** If you have a `public` directory, make sure it doesn't have a file or directory with the same name as one of your pages. For example, if you have a `pages/about.js` and a `public/about` directory, you'll get a 404 error when you try to navigate to `/about`.

6. **Check your logs:** Vercel provides build logs when you deploy your application. Check these logs for any error messages that might help you debug the issue.

7. **Upgrade Next.js:** If none of the above steps help, consider upgrading to the latest version of Next.js. There might be a bug in the version you're using that's causing the issue.

If you're still having trouble, please provide more details about your application, such as your directory structure and any relevant code snippets.
