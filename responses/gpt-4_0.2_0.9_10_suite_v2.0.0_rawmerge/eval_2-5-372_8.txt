It seems like you're facing a version conflict issue. The error message indicates that Hibernate Validator 5.3.5.Final-redhat-2 is being used, but the `@NotEmpty` and `@NotBlank` annotations are not supported until Hibernate Validator 6.0.0.Final.

The version of Hibernate Validator is managed by Spring Boot. The version of Spring Boot you're using (2.0.4.RELEASE) should be using Hibernate Validator 6.0.7.Final, which supports `@NotEmpty` and `@NotBlank`.

However, it seems like JBoss is using its own version of Hibernate Validator (5.3.5.Final-redhat-2), which is causing the conflict.

To resolve this issue, you can try to exclude the Hibernate Validator provided by JBoss. You can do this by creating a `jboss-deployment-structure.xml` file in your `src/main/webapp/WEB-INF` directory with the following content:

```xml
<jboss-deployment-structure>
    <deployment>
        <exclusions>
            <module name="org.hibernate.validator" />
        </exclusions>
    </deployment>
</jboss-deployment-structure>
```

This will tell JBoss to not use its own version of Hibernate Validator and instead use the one provided by your application.

If this doesn't work, you might need to upgrade your version of JBoss, or switch to a different application server that doesn't have this conflict.
