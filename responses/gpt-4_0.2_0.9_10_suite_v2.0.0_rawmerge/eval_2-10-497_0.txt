In Rust, you don't typically deal with null pointers. Instead, Rust has the `Option` type which can be `Some` or `None`. This is used to represent the presence or absence of a value.

To implement a stack in Rust, you can use `Option<Box<Node>>` for the `next` field in `Node` and `top` field in `Stack`. Here's how you can do it:

```rust
struct Node {
    value: i32,
    next: Option<Box<Node>>,
}

struct Stack {
    top: Option<Box<Node>>,
}
```

In this case, `None` represents a null pointer. You can check if a `Box<Node>` is null by checking if it's `None`:

```rust
if let Some(node) = &self.top {
    // The stack is not empty
} else {
    // The stack is empty
}
```

In the above code, `&self.top` is a reference to the `top` field of the `Stack`. The `if let` statement checks if `&self.top` is `Some(node)`. If it is, the code inside the first block is executed. If it's not (i.e., it's `None`), the code inside the `else` block is executed.
