The `[Keyless]` attribute is not part of the `System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations` namespace. It's actually part of the `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore` namespace. 

This attribute is used to specify that an entity does not have a key and should never be tracked for changes in the DbContext. It's typically used for read-only entities that are mapped to database views or queries.

To use the `[Keyless]` attribute, you need to add a reference to the `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore` namespace. 

Here is how you can do it:

```c#
using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore;

[Keyless]
public class MyKeylessClass
{
    // Your class properties
}
```

Also, make sure you have installed the appropriate Entity Framework Core package. If you haven't, you can install it via NuGet Package Manager:

```shell
Install-Package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore
```

Or via .NET CLI:

```shell
dotnet add package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore
```
