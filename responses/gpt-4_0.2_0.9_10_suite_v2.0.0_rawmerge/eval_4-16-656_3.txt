The `Get-Service` cmdlet in PowerShell does not provide the "Description" property of a service. However, you can use the `Get-WmiObject` cmdlet to retrieve the description of a service. Here is an example:

```powershell
Get-WmiObject -Class Win32_Service | Select-Object Name, DisplayName, Description | Out-GridView
```

This command will get all the services on your machine and display their name, display name, and description in a grid view. If you want to get the description of a specific service, you can filter the services by name:

```powershell
Get-WmiObject -Class Win32_Service | Where-Object { $_.Name -eq 'serviceName' } | Select-Object Name, DisplayName, Description
```

Replace `'serviceName'` with the name of the service you want to get the description for.
