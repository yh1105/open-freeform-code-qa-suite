Sure, here is the corrected version of your function:

```python
def pig_latin(text):
    words = text.split()
    pig_latin_words = []
    for word in words:
        endString = word[1:] + word[0].lower() + 'ay'
        pig_latin_words.append(endString)
    return ' '.join(pig_latin_words)
```

In your original code, you were returning the first transformed word immediately in the loop, which is why you were not getting the full sentence transformed. The corrected function creates a new list `pig_latin_words` to store each transformed word, and then joins them together with spaces at the end.
