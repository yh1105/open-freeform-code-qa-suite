Here is a Python function that uses the `itertools.cycle` function to repeat the list of strings indefinitely. This function will fill the new column with the list of strings in the order they appear in the list, repeating as necessary until all rows in the DataFrame are filled.

```python
import pandas as pd
import itertools

def fillColumn(df, columnName, columnData):
    df[columnName] = [x for x in itertools.islice(itertools.cycle(columnData), len(df))]
    return df
```

You can use this function like this:

```python
my_list = ['abc','def','hig']
df = fillColumn(df, 'names', my_list)
```

This will create a new column in `df` named 'names' and fill it with the strings from `my_list` in the order they appear in the list, repeating as necessary until all rows in the DataFrame are filled.
