The `apt-get` package manager installs the version of the software that is in its repositories, which may not always be the latest version. If you want to install the latest version of cmake, you can download it from the official website and install it manually.

Here are the steps to do that:

1. First, remove the existing version of cmake:

```bash
sudo apt-get remove cmake
```

2. Then, download the latest version of cmake from the official website. At the time of writing, the latest version is 3.21.1. You can replace `3.21.1` with the latest version number.

```bash
wget https://github.com/Kitware/CMake/releases/download/v3.21.1/cmake-3.21.1.tar.gz
```

3. Extract the downloaded file:

```bash
tar -xzvf cmake-3.21.1.tar.gz
```

4. Navigate to the extracted directory:

```bash
cd cmake-3.21.1
```

5. Now, run the bootstrap script:

```bash
./bootstrap
```

6. Make the build files:

```bash
make
```

7. Finally, install cmake:

```bash
sudo make install
```

8. Verify the installed version of cmake:

```bash
cmake --version
```

This should show the version number as `3.21.1` or whatever the latest version you installed.

Please note that you need to have `wget`, `tar`, and `make` installed on your system to follow these steps. If they are not installed, you can install them using `apt-get`:

```bash
sudo apt-get install wget tar make
```
