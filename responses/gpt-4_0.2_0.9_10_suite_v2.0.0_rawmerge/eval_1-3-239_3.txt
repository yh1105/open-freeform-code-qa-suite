Sure, here is a simple bash script that will install a specific version of Python using Homebrew:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Unlink current Python
brew unlink python

# Install Python 3.6.5
brew install python@3.6

# Link Python 3.6.5
brew link --force python@3.6
```

Please note that this script will unlink your current version of Python, install Python 3.6.5, and then link Python 3.6.5. If you have other versions of Python installed, this may affect them.
