You can use the `loc` function in pandas to filter rows by column value. Here's how you can do it:

```python
data_pass_test = data_useless.loc[data_useless['TEST_STATUS'] == 'PASS TEST']
```

This will give you a new DataFrame `data_pass_test` that only contains rows where `TEST_STATUS` is 'PASS TEST'.

If you want to group by `TEST_STATUS` after that (although it might not be very useful since all the values will be 'PASS TEST'), you can do:

```python
grouped_data = data_pass_test.groupby('TEST_STATUS')
```

If you want to count the number of 'PASS TEST' for each 'TEST_TYPE', you can do:

```python
grouped_data = data_pass_test.groupby('TEST_TYPE').size()
```

This will give you a Series where the index is the 'TEST_TYPE' and the value is the count of 'PASS TEST' for that type.
