Starting from macOS Catalina 10.15, the default shell is `zsh` instead of `bash`. Therefore, `~/.bash_profile` and `~/.profile` are not sourced by default when you open a new terminal window.

If you want to set environment variables that are available in all `zsh` sessions, you should add them to `~/.zshrc` file instead.

Here is how you can do it:

1. Open `~/.zshrc` with a text editor. If the file does not exist, create it.

```bash
nano ~/.zshrc
```

2. Add your environment variable at the end of the file.

```bash
export JBOSS_HOME=/Users/{USERNAME}/Desktop/jboss7
```

3. Save and close the file. If you are using `nano`, you can do this by pressing `Ctrl+X`, then `Y` to confirm that you want to save the changes, and then `Enter` to confirm the file name.

4. Source the `~/.zshrc` file to apply the changes immediately. Otherwise, the changes will take effect the next time you start a new `zsh` session.

```bash
source ~/.zshrc
```

5. Now, if you run `echo $JBOSS_HOME`, it should print `/Users/{USERNAME}/Desktop/jboss7`.

Remember to replace `{USERNAME}` with your actual username.
