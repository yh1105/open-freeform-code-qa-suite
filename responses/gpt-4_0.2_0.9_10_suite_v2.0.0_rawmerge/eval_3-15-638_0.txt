The `SelectByID2` method requires the name of the entity to be selected. For faces, edges, and vertices, these are usually not named, so you can't select them directly using `SelectByID2`. 

However, you can create reference geometry (like points) at the locations you're interested in, and then select those using `SelectByID2`, as they will have names. 

Here's an example of how you might create a reference point at the midpoint of an edge:

```vba
Dim swRefPt As SldWorks.RefPoint
Dim swEdge As SldWorks.Edge
Dim swCurve As SldWorks.Curve
Dim swRefPtData As SldWorks.RefPointFeatureData
Dim swFeat As SldWorks.Feature

Set swEdge = swSelMgr.GetSelectedObject6(1, -1)
Set swCurve = swEdge.GetCurve
Set swFeat = swPart.FeatureManager.InsertReferencePoint( _
    swRefPointType_e.swRefPointAlongCurve, swCurve, 0.5)
Set swRefPt = swFeat.GetSpecificFeature2
```

Now, you can select this reference point using `SelectByID2`:

```vba
swModel.Extension.SelectByID2(swRefPt.Name, "DATUMPOINT", 0, 0, 0, False, 0, Nothing, 0)
```

You can do something similar for the face: create a reference plane on the face, and then select that using `SelectByID2`. 

Once you have both the point and the plane selected, you can use `InsertRefPlane` to create a reference plane. 

Remember to clear the selection before each `SelectByID2` call if you don't want to append to the current selection.
