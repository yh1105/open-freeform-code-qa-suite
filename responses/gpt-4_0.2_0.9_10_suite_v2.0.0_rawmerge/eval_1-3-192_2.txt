Here is a Python solution using the `re` module to split the string and then capitalize each word except the first one:

```python
import re

def to_camel_case(text):
    words = re.split('-|_', text)
    return words[0] + ''.join(word.capitalize() for word in words[1:])
```

This function works by first splitting the input string into words at each dash or underscore. Then it returns a new string that is the concatenation of the first word and each subsequent word with the first letter capitalized. This results in a camel case string.

Let's test this function with the provided test cases:

```python
print(to_camel_case(''))  # ''
print(to_camel_case("the_stealth_warrior"))  # 'theStealthWarrior'
print(to_camel_case("The-Stealth-Warrior"))  # 'TheStealthWarrior'
print(to_camel_case("A-B-C"))  # 'ABC'
```

This should print the expected results.
