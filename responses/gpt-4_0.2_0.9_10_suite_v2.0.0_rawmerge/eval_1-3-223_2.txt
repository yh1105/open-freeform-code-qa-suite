You can use the `pkg_resources` module to get the installed version of a package, and the `yolk3k` package to get the latest version available on PyPI. Here is a function that does this:

```python
import pkg_resources
from yolk.pip import Pip
from yolk.metadata import Metadata

def checkVersion(pkgName):
    # Get installed version
    installed_version = pkg_resources.get_distribution(pkgName).version

    # Get latest version
    pip = Pip()
    latest_version = None
    for dist, active in pip.get_installed_distributions():
        if dist.project_name.lower() == pkgName.lower():
            metadata = Metadata.from_package(dist)
            latest_version = metadata.version
            break

    # Compare versions
    return installed_version == latest_version
```

This function will return `True` if the installed version is the latest, and `False` otherwise.

Please note that you need to install `yolk3k` package to use this function. You can install it using pip:

```bash
pip install yolk3k
```

Also, please note that this function assumes that the package is already installed. If the package is not installed, `pkg_resources.get_distribution(pkgName).version` will raise a `DistributionNotFound` exception. You may want to add error handling for this case.
