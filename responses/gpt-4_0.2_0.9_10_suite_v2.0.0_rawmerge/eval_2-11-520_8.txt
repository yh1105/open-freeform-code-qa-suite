The error message is indicating that the `operator==` in `SeviceClient` does not match the signature of any `operator==` in the base class `IClient<int8_t>`. 

In your `IClient` class, the `operator==` is declared as:
```c++
virtual bool operator==(const IClient& anotherClient) = 0;
```
But in your `SeviceClient` class, the `operator==` is declared as:
```c++
bool operator==(const SeviceClient& anotherClient) override;
```
The argument type is different (`SeviceClient` vs `IClient`), so the compiler doesn't see this as an override of the base class's method.

To fix this, you should change the `operator==` in `SeviceClient` to take a `const IClient<int8_t>&` as its argument:
```c++
bool operator==(const IClient<int8_t>& anotherClient) override {
    // implementation
}
```
And then, inside the implementation of this method, you can use `dynamic_cast` to check if `anotherClient` is actually a `SeviceClient`, and if so, perform the comparison:
```c++
bool operator==(const IClient<int8_t>& anotherClient) override {
    const SeviceClient* other = dynamic_cast<const SeviceClient*>(&anotherClient);
    if (other) {
        // perform comparison
    }
    return false;  // or throw an exception, or whatever is appropriate in your case
}
```
