The `~/.bashrc` file is not sourced when you run a non-interactive shell, which is the case when you run a Docker container. 

To solve this issue, you can source the `~/.bashrc` file in your `launch.sh` script. Modify your `launch.sh` script as follows:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

source $HOME/.bashrc

cd /workspace/demo
npm install
node index.js
```

This will ensure that the `nvm` and `node` commands are available in the shell that runs your script.
