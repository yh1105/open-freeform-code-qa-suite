The problem is that you're using single quotes around `$searchT` which prevents variable expansion. You should use double quotes instead. Here's the corrected script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
read -p "enter search term here: " searchT

if [[ $(grep -wi "$searchT" test.txt) ]]; then     
    echo "$(grep -w "$searchT" test.txt | wc -l) number of matches found"
    grep -w "$searchT" test.txt
else 
    echo "no match found"    
fi

exit 0
```

In this script, `grep -wi "$searchT" test.txt` will search for the term entered by the user in the file `test.txt`. If the term is found, the number of matches will be printed, followed by the lines containing the matches. If the term is not found, "no match found" will be printed.
