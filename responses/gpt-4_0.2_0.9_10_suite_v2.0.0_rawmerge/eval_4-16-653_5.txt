You can use the `date` command in Unix to convert the date format. Here is a simple script that reads each line from the file, converts the date, and then prints it:

```bash
while IFS= read -r line
do
    # Extract the date part from the line
    date_str=$(echo $line | cut -d'T' -f1)

    # Convert to the desired format
    new_date=$(date -d$date_str +"%d %b %Y")

    echo $new_date
done < filename.txt
```

This script assumes that `filename.txt` is the file containing your dates. It reads each line from the file, extracts the date part before the 'T', converts it to the "DD MMM YYYY" format, and then prints it.
