Yes, there is a better way to handle this in Rust. You can use the `?` operator to simplify the code. The `?` operator is used after a function that returns a `Result` or `Option`. If the function returns an `Err` or `None`, the `?` operator will return early from the function it's in. If the function returns an `Ok` or `Some`, the `?` operator will unwrap the value and give it to you.

Here is how you can refactor your code:

```rust
fn main() {
    match process() {
        Ok(result) => {
            // Do something with result
        }
        Err(e) => println!("{}", e),
    }
}

fn process() -> Result<YourType, &'static str> {
    let i = func1().ok_or("func 1 returned None")?;
    let j = func2(i).ok_or("func 2 returned None")?;
    let k = func3(j).ok_or("func 3 returned None")?;
    let result = func4(k).ok_or("func 4 returned None")?;
    Ok(result)
}
```

In this refactored code, `process` function is doing all the work. It calls `func1`, `func2`, `func3`, and `func4` in order. If any of these functions return `None`, the `?` operator will cause `process` to return early with an `Err` that contains the appropriate error message. If all of the functions return `Some`, `process` will return `Ok(result)`, where `result` is the result of `func4`.

In the `main` function, we call `process` and match on its result. If `process` returns `Ok`, we do something with the result. If `process` returns `Err`, we print the error message.

This refactored code is much cleaner and easier to read than the original code. It also has the advantage of being more idiomatic Rust.
