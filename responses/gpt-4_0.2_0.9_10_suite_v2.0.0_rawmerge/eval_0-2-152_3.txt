You can use the `toast` method provided by Bootstrap to show the toast. Here is how you can modify your JavaScript code:

```javascript
$('.toast').toast('show');
```

This will show the toast when the page loads. If you want to show the toast on a specific event, such as a button click, you can do something like this:

```javascript
$('#myButton').click(function() {
  $('.toast').toast('show');
});
```

In this example, the toast will show when the element with the id `myButton` is clicked.

Also, make sure that you have included the necessary Bootstrap CSS and JS files in your HTML file. The toast component requires the Bootstrap's JavaScript file to work properly.
