The error you're encountering is because the `pdftk` binary you're trying to use is not compatible with your version of macOS. This is a common issue on macOS Catalina and later versions because Apple dropped support for 32-bit applications.

Here's how you can solve this issue:

1. Uninstall the current `pdftk` version you have.

    ```bash
    brew uninstall pdftk
    ```

2. Install `pdftk-java` which is a reimplementation of `pdftk` in Java.

    ```bash
    brew install pdftk-java
    ```

3. Create a symbolic link to `pdftk-java` as `pdftk` so you can use the same `pdftk` command as before.

    ```bash
    echo 'alias pdftk="/usr/local/bin/pdftk-java"' >> ~/.zshrc
    ```

4. Source your `.zshrc` to apply the changes.

    ```bash
    source ~/.zshrc
    ```

Now, you should be able to use `pdftk` as before. Please note that `pdftk-java` requires Java to be installed on your machine. If you don't have Java installed, you can install it using Homebrew:

```bash
brew cask install java
```
