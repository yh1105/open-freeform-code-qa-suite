Yes, you can use `ArrayList` with an initial capacity in Kotlin. It's a perfectly valid `MutableList`. Here's how you can do it:

```kotlin
val list = ArrayList<Int>(initialCapacity)
```

This way, you can avoid the overhead of resizing the list if you know the eventual number of elements in advance. This can be beneficial in performance-critical sections of your code.
