The comment is partially correct. 

In object-oriented programming, a constructor is a special type of subroutine called to create an object. It prepares the new object for use, often accepting arguments that the constructor uses to set required member variables. 

While it's true that a constructor is automatically invoked when a new object is created, it's not entirely accurate to say that a constructor "cannot be called" or "is not a function". In many languages, like JavaScript and Python, constructors are indeed functions (specifically, special methods) that can be explicitly called if needed. 

However, in languages like Java and C++, constructors have the same name as the class and cannot be called like regular methods. Instead, they are invoked using the `new` keyword. 

So, the accuracy of the comment depends on the programming language in context.
