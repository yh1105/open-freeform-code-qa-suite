The error message "error: ‘std::filesystem’ has not been declared" is indicating that the compiler can't find the `std::filesystem` namespace. This is because the `std::filesystem` library was not part of the standard library until C++17, and even then, some compilers didn't include it until later versions.

In your case, you're including `<experimental/filesystem>`, which is the experimental version of the library that was available before it was officially added to the standard. The experimental version is in the `std::experimental::filesystem` namespace, not `std::filesystem`.

To fix this, you should change `std::filesystem` to `std::experimental::filesystem` in your code. Here's how your code should look:

```c++
#include <experimental/filesystem>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

namespace fs = std::experimental::filesystem;

int main(int argc, char** argv)
{
    std::string imageDirectory = "./image";
    std::vector<std::string> imagePath;
    for (const auto& entry: fs::directory_iterator(imageDirectory))
    {
        imagePath.push_back(entry.path().string());
        std::cout << entry.path() << std::endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
```

Also, note that `entry.path()` returns a `fs::path` object, not a string. So you need to call `.string()` on it to convert it to a string before you can push it onto your vector of strings.

Finally, make sure your compiler supports C++17 and that you're compiling with the `-std=c++17` flag. If you're using g++, you might also need to link against `-lstdc++fs` to get the filesystem library.
