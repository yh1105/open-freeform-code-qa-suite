The error you're getting is because you're trying to import the Bootstrap variables before you define your own. The `$theme-colors` map is defined in the `_variables.scss` file, so when you import it before defining your own, it's already set and can't be changed.

To fix this, you should define your `$theme-colors` map before importing the Bootstrap files. Also, you need to import all the Bootstrap SCSS files, not just the `variables.scss` file.

Here's how you can do it:

```scss
// Define your own theme colors
$theme-colors: (
  "primary": #your-color,
  // Add other colors if needed
);

// Import Bootstrap and its variables
@import "../../node_modules/bootstrap/scss/bootstrap";
```

Replace `#your-color` with the color you want to use for the primary color. You can add more colors to the map if you want to change other theme colors as well.

Also, make sure you're using Dart Sass instead of Node Sass. Bootstrap 5 requires Dart Sass, and Node Sass is deprecated. You can install Dart Sass with npm:

```bash
npm install -D sass
```

Then you can compile your SCSS file with Dart Sass:

```bash
npx sass style.scss custom.css
```
