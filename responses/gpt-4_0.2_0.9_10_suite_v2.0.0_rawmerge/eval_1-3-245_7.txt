Your Dockerfile seems to be correct. The issue might be with the way you're referencing your FastAPI application in the CMD command. 

In your CMD command, you're using `app.main:app`. This means Docker is looking for a Python module named `app` inside an `app` directory, and then it's looking for an object named `app` inside that `app` module.

If your `main.py` file is directly under the `app` directory and your FastAPI application is named `app` inside that `main.py` file, then your CMD command should be correct.

However, if your FastAPI application is named something else, you'll need to adjust the CMD command accordingly. For example, if your FastAPI application is named `myapp`, your CMD command should be `["uvicorn", "app.main:myapp", "--host=0.0.0.0" , "--reload" , "--port", "8000"]`.

Also, make sure that your `main.py` file is correctly importing the `app` object. For example, if you're using `from fastapi import FastAPI` and then `app = FastAPI()`, that should be correct.

If you're still having issues, please provide more information about the structure of your `main.py` file and how you're defining your FastAPI application.
