The error you're getting is because the value '2021.0' is a string representation of a float, not an integer. You can't directly convert it to an integer using `int()`. You need to convert it to a float first, then convert that float to an integer.

Here is the function `transformation`:

```python
def transformation(data_h_df):
    data_h_df['year'] = data_h_df['year'].apply(lambda x: int(float(x)))
    return data_h_df
```

This function applies a lambda function to each element in the 'year' column of the dataframe. The lambda function takes a string, converts it to a float, then converts that float to an integer. The result is a dataframe with the 'year' column transformed from strings to integers.
