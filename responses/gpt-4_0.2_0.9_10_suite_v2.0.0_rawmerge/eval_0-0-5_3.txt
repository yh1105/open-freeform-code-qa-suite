The error log indicates that Python is not found in your PATH. Node-gyp, which is a part of the build process, requires Python to work. Here's how you can fix this:

1. Install Python 2.7.x. Node-gyp does not work with Python 3.x, so it's important to install a 2.7.x version. You can download it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. During the Python installation, make sure to check the box that says "Add Python.exe to Path". This will automatically add Python to your environment variables.

3. After installation, you can verify that Python is correctly installed and in your PATH by opening a new command prompt and typing `python --version`. You should see the Python version printed to the console.

4. Once Python is installed and configured, try to build your project again.

If you already have Python installed, it's possible that it's not correctly set in your PATH. In this case, you can manually add it:

1. Find the location of your Python installation. The default is usually `C:\Python27\`.

2. Add that directory to your PATH environment variable. You can do this by searching for "Environment Variables" in your start menu, then clicking on "Edit the system environment variables". In the System Properties window that appears, click on "Environment Variables". In the Environment Variables window, scroll down to "Path" under System variables, and click on "Edit". In the Edit Environment Variable window, click on "New", then add the path to your Python installation.

3. Verify that Python is correctly set in your PATH by opening a new command prompt and typing `python --version`.

4. Try to build your project again.
