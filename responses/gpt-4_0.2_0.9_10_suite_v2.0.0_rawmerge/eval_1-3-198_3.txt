Sure, here is a function that can process the Google Drive URL and return the direct download link for the CSV file. 

```python
def processURL(url):
    file_id = url.split('/')[-2]
    dwn_url='https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=' + file_id
    return dwn_url
```

This function works by extracting the file ID from the Google Drive URL and then constructing a new URL that points directly to the file's download link.

You can use this function in your code like this:

```python
import pandas as pd

url = 'https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B6GhBwm5vaB2ekdlZW5WZnppb28/view?usp=sharing'
url = processURL(url)
dfs = pd.read_csv(url)
```

Please note that this will only work if the file is publicly accessible. If the file is private, you will need to use the Google Drive API and authenticate before you can download the file.
