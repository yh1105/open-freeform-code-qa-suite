Yes, you can use the CSS media feature `prefers-color-scheme` to detect if the user has requested the system use a light or dark color theme.

Here is an example:

```css
/* Light mode */
@media (prefers-color-scheme: light) {
  body {
    background-color: white;
    color: black;
  }
}

/* Dark mode */
@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
  body {
    background-color: black;
    color: white;
  }
}
```

This CSS will apply different styles based on the user's preferred color scheme. This feature is supported in Safari 12.1, Firefox 67, and Chrome 76 and later versions.

Please note that this only works if the user's operating system supports this feature and the user has chosen a preference. If the user's system does not support this feature or the user has not chosen a preference, you should provide a default style.
