You can use `awk` to extract the language code from the HTML tag. Here's how you can do it:

```bash
curl -Ls stick-it.app | grep -o 'lang="[a-zA-Z-]*"' | head -1 | awk -F'"' '{print $2}'
```

Here's what this does:

- `curl -Ls stick-it.app` fetches the HTML of the page.
- `grep -o 'lang="[a-zA-Z-]*"'` extracts the `lang` attribute from the HTML. The `-o` option tells `grep` to only output the part of the line that matches the pattern.
- `head -1` takes only the first match.
- `awk -F'"' '{print $2}'` splits the line on the `"` character and prints the second field, which is the language code.

This should work regardless of where the `lang` attribute is located within the `<html>` tag.
