This error typically occurs because the script `startup.sh` does not have execute permissions. You can add execute permissions to the script by running the following command:

```bash
chmod +x ./startup.sh
```

This command uses `chmod` to add (`+`) execute (`x`) permissions to `startup.sh`. After running this command, you should be able to execute your script with `./startup.sh nginx:start`.
