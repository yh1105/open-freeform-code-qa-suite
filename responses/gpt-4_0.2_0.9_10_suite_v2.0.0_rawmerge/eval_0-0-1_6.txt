It's hard to give a precise solution without seeing your code, but here are some general steps you can take to debug and potentially solve the issue:

1. **Check your `package.json` file:** Ensure that your `build` and `start` scripts are correctly configured. They should look something like this:

    ```json
    "scripts": {
        "dev": "next dev",
        "build": "next build",
        "start": "next start"
    }
    ```

2. **Check your dynamic routes:** If you're using dynamic routes, make sure you're using the file-based routing system correctly. For example, a file named `pages/posts/[id].js` will match `/posts/1`, `/posts/abc`, etc. But it won't match `/posts`.

3. **Check your `getStaticPaths` and `getStaticProps` (or `getServerSideProps`):** If you're using dynamic routes, you're likely using `getStaticPaths` and `getStaticProps` (or `getServerSideProps`). Make sure you're returning the correct values from these functions.

4. **Check your API routes:** If you're using API routes, make sure they're correctly set up in the `pages/api` directory.

5. **Check your public directory:** If you're serving static files, make sure they're in the `public` directory and you're referencing them correctly.

6. **Check your dependencies:** Make sure all your dependencies are listed in your `package.json` file and that they're the correct versions.

7. **Check your environment variables:** If you're using environment variables, make sure they're correctly set up in Vercel. Remember, you need to prefix them with `NEXT_PUBLIC_` if you want to access them on the client-side.

8. **Check the build logs:** If none of the above helps, check the build logs in Vercel. They should give you more information about what's going wrong.

If you're still having trouble, please provide more information about your setup and the exact error message you're seeing.
