The error message is telling you that you cannot create an index on a navigation property. In Entity Framework, indexes can only be created on scalar properties, not on navigation properties.

Here's how you can fix it:

```csharp
protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder modelBuilder)
{
    modelBuilder.Entity<User>(user =>
    {
        user
            .HasOne(x => x.Gender)
            .WithMany(x => x.Users)
            .HasForeignKey(x => x.GenderId);

        user.HasIndex(x => x.GenderId); // Change this line
    });
}
```

In the above code, I replaced `x.Gender` with `x.GenderId` in the `HasIndex` method. This is because `GenderId` is a scalar property, while `Gender` is a navigation property.
