You can use the following PowerShell function to check if a specified folder is in your PATH:

```powershell
function FolderIsInPATH($Path_to_directory) {
    $path = $env:Path -split ';'
    return $path -contains $Path_to_directory
}
```

This function splits the PATH environment variable into an array of directories and checks if the specified directory is in that array. It returns `True` if the directory is in the PATH, and `False` otherwise.
