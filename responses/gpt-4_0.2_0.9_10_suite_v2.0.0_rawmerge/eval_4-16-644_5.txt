This error typically occurs because the `startup.sh` script does not have execute permissions. You can add execute permissions to the script by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
chmod +x ./startup.sh
```

This command uses `chmod` to add (`+`) execute (`x`) permissions to `startup.sh`. After running this command, you should be able to run your script with `./startup.sh nginx:start`.
