For React 17, you should use the `@wojtekmaj/enzyme-adapter-react-17` adapter. This is an unofficial adapter for Enzyme to use with React 17 since the official adapter doesn't support React 17 yet.

Here is how you can adapt your code:

```javascript
import Enzyme from 'enzyme';
import Adapter from '@wojtekmaj/enzyme-adapter-react-17';

Enzyme.configure({ adapter: new Adapter() });
```

Before using this, make sure to install the adapter by running:

```bash
npm install --save @wojtekmaj/enzyme-adapter-react-17
```

or if you use yarn:

```bash
yarn add @wojtekmaj/enzyme-adapter-react-17
```
