In Tailwind CSS, you don't directly select elements like you do in traditional CSS. Instead, you apply utility classes directly to the elements you want to style. 

So, if you want to style direct children of a `div` with class "section", you would need to apply the classes directly to those child `div` elements in your HTML.

Here's an example:

```html
<div class="section">
  <div class="bg-blue-500 text-white"> <!-- Apply classes here -->
    <!-- Content -->
  </div>
  <div class="bg-blue-500 text-white"> <!-- Apply classes here -->
    <!-- Content -->
  </div>
</div>
```

In this example, `bg-blue-500` applies a blue background and `text-white` applies white text color to the direct children of the `div` with class "section".

Remember, Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework where you build complex designs through a series of smaller, easier to manage pieces (utility classes). It doesn't include direct equivalents to all CSS selectors and properties.
