Sure, the issue is that you are mocking the API class as an object, not as a class. You should return a function (which will be used as a constructor) from the mock, not an object. Here is the corrected code:

```javascript
import API from 'utils/API';

jest.mock('utils/API', () => {
  return jest.fn().mockImplementation(() => {
    return {someMethod: () => {}};
  });
});
```

In this code, `jest.fn().mockImplementation()` returns a mock function that can be used as a constructor. When you call `new API()`, it will return the object `{someMethod: () => {}}`.
