The issue is that you're using `@Binding` in `ContentView` but you're not providing a source of truth for the `isSelected` variable. 

In SwiftUI, `@Binding` is used to create a two-way connection between a variable and a source of truth. In your case, you're not providing a source of truth for `isSelected` variable.

You should use `@State` in the parent view to provide a source of truth for the `isSelected` variable. Here is the corrected code:

```swift
import SwiftUI

struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var isSelected: Bool = false

    var body: some View {
        Button(action: {
            self.isSelected.toggle()
        }) {
            Text(isSelected ? "Selected" : "Not Selected")
        }
    }
}

struct ContentView_Previews: PreviewProvider {
    static var previews: some View {
        ContentView()
    }
}
```

In this corrected code, `@State` is used to provide a source of truth for the `isSelected` variable. When the button is clicked, `isSelected` is toggled and the view is updated.
