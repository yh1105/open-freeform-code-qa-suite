In Rust, you can't have a "null" or "empty" value for a struct field like you can in some other languages. Instead, you can use the `Option` enum to represent a value that might be absent.

Here's how you can modify your `FistClient` struct and its methods to use `Option<TcpStream>`:

```rust
use std::net::TcpStream;
use std::io;

pub struct FistClient {
    addr: String,
    conn: Option<TcpStream>,
}

impl FistClient {
    pub fn new(ip: &str, port: &str) -> Self {
        FistClient {
            addr: format!("{}:{}", ip, port),
            conn: None,
        }
    }

    pub fn connect(&mut self) -> io::Result<()> {
        match TcpStream::connect(&self.addr) {
            Ok(c) => {
                self.conn = Some(c);
                Ok(())
            },
            Err(e) => Err(e),
        }
    }
}
```

In this code:

- The `conn` field is now of type `Option<TcpStream>`, which means it can either hold a `TcpStream` (wrapped in `Some`) or nothing (`None`).
- In the `new` method, `conn` is initialized to `None`.
- The `connect` method attempts to create a `TcpStream`. If it's successful, it wraps the stream in `Some` and stores it in `conn`. If it fails, it returns the error.

Note that the `connect` method now returns a `Result` type. This is a more idiomatic way to handle errors in Rust than calling `panic!()`. It allows the caller to decide how to handle the error.
