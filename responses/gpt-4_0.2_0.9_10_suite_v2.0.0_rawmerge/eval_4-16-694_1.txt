You can use `awk` to extract the language code. Here is an example:

```bash
curl -Ls stick-it.app | grep -o 'lang="[a-zA-Z-]*"' | head -1 | awk -F'"' '{print $2}'
```

Here is what each part of the command does:

- `curl -Ls stick-it.app`: Fetches the content of the page.
- `grep -o 'lang="[a-zA-Z-]*"'`: This uses grep to find all instances of `lang="..."` in the page content. The `-o` option tells grep to only output the part of the line that matches the pattern.
- `head -1`: This takes only the first match.
- `awk -F'"' '{print $2}'`: This uses awk to split the line at each quote character and print the second field, which is the language code.

This command should work regardless of whether the language code is in the format `en-US` or `he-IL`.
