The error message you're seeing is because Bootstrap requires `Popper.js` for the dropdowns and other interactive components. 

You can install it using npm or yarn:

**npm:**

```bash
npm install popper.js --save
```

**yarn:**

```bash
yarn add popper.js
```

After installing, you can import it in your file:

```javascript
import Popper from 'popper.js';
```

If you're using Bootstrap 4, you can also consider using `@popperjs/core` instead of `popper.js`. It's the successor to `popper.js` and is used in Bootstrap 5.

**npm:**

```bash
npm install @popperjs/core --save
```

**yarn:**

```bash
yarn add @popperjs/core
```

Then import it in your file:

```javascript
import { createPopper } from '@popperjs/core';
```

Remember to restart your development server after installing new dependencies.
