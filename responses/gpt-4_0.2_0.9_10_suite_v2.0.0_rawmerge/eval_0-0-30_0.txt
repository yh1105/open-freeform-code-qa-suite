Yes, there is an unofficial adapter for React 17 that you can use. It's called `@wojtekmaj/enzyme-adapter-react-17`. 

Here is how you can adapt your code:

```javascript
import Enzyme from 'enzyme';
import Adapter from '@wojtekmaj/enzyme-adapter-react-17';

Enzyme.configure({ adapter: new Adapter() });
```

Before you use this, make sure to install the adapter with npm:

```bash
npm install --save @wojtekmaj/enzyme-adapter-react-17
```

Or with yarn:

```bash
yarn add @wojtekmaj/enzyme-adapter-react-17
```

Please note that this is an unofficial adapter, and it may not support all features or may not be maintained in the future.
