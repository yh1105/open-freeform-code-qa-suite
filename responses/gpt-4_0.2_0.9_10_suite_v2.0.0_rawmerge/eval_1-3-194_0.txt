You can use the `openpyxl` library in Python to write data into an Excel file. Here is how you can do it:

```python
from openpyxl import Workbook

def writeExcel():
    new_list = [["first", "second"], ["third", "fourth"]]

    # Create a workbook and select the active worksheet
    wb = Workbook()
    ws = wb.active

    # Write data to worksheet
    for i in range(len(new_list)):
        for j in range(len(new_list[i])):
            ws.cell(row=i+1, column=j+1, value=new_list[i][j])

    # Save the workbook
    wb.save("data.xlsx")
```

In this function, we first create a new workbook and select the active worksheet. Then we iterate over the list of lists and write each element to the corresponding cell in the worksheet. Finally, we save the workbook to a file named "data.xlsx".

Please note that you need to install the `openpyxl` library before you can use it. You can install it using pip:

```bash
pip install openpyxl
```
