You should use `@Configuration` when you want to define beans explicitly in code rather than using auto-detection or XML configuration. This is typically used when the bean creation process involves complex logic or dependencies that cannot be expressed with auto-detection or XML.

On the other hand, `@Service`, `@Controller`, and `@Component` are used for auto-detection of beans. They are used to annotate classes at the stereotype level, allowing for automatic detection and wiring of classes.

- `@Service`: Annotates classes at the service layer.
- `@Controller`: Annotates classes at the presentation layer, mainly used in Spring MVC.
- `@Component`: A generic annotation, can be used across application. 

Remember, `@Configuration` classes can also use `@ComponentScan` to specify base packages for component scanning, thus combining explicit bean definition with auto-detection.
