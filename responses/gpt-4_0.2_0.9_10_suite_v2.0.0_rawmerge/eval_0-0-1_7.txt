The issue you're facing could be due to a number of reasons. Here are a few things you could check:

1. **Check your `package.json` scripts:** Vercel uses the `build` script in your `package.json` to build your application. Make sure you have a `build` script and it's correctly set to `next build`.

2. **Check your dynamic routes:** If you're using dynamic routes, make sure you're using Next.js's file-based routing correctly. Dynamic routes should be named as `[param].js` in your `pages` directory, where `param` is the name of the parameter you want to use in your route.

3. **Check your `vercel.json` (if you have one):** If you have a `vercel.json` configuration file, make sure it's correctly set up. If you don't have one, you might want to consider adding one to specify your routes and other configuration options.

4. **Check your deployment settings on Vercel:** Make sure you've set up your project correctly on Vercel. You should select "Next.js" as your framework preset when creating your project.

5. **Check your import/export statements:** Make sure all your import/export statements are correct and you're not trying to import a file that doesn't exist or has a different name/case. This can sometimes cause issues, especially if your local environment is case-insensitive but your server environment is case-sensitive.

6. **Check your serverless functions (if you have any):** If you're using serverless functions, make sure they're correctly set up and not causing any issues.

If none of these solve your issue, you might want to consider reaching out to Vercel support or checking their documentation for more information.
