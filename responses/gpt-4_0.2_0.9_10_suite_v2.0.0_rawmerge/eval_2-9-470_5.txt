The error message indicates that the ffi gem is trying to load `libffi.so.6`, but it can't find it. This usually happens when you upgrade your OS and the system updates the libffi library to a newer version, but the ffi gem is still looking for the old version.

You can confirm this by checking the version of libffi in your system. Run this command in your terminal:

```bash
find /usr -name libffi.so*
```

You'll probably see `libffi.so.7` (or a higher version), but not `libffi.so.6`.

To fix this issue, you need to reinstall the ffi gem. Here are the steps:

1. Uninstall the ffi gem:

    ```bash
    gem uninstall ffi
    ```

2. Reinstall the ffi gem:

    ```bash
    gem install ffi
    ```

This will make the ffi gem compile against the newer version of libffi in your system.

If you're using Bundler and you have a `Gemfile`, you might need to run `bundle install` to reinstall the gems specified in your `Gemfile`.

If the problem persists, try reinstalling your Ruby version with rbenv. This will ensure that all the built-in gems are compiled against the correct libraries in your system.

```bash
rbenv uninstall 2.7.1
rbenv install 2.7.1
```

Remember to replace `2.7.1` with your actual Ruby version.
