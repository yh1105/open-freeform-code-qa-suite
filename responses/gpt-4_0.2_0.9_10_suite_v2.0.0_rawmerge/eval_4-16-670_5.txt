Yes, you can convert your OpenSSH private key to an RSA private key using the `ssh-keygen` tool that comes with OpenSSH. Here are the steps:

1. Convert OpenSSH private key to RSA private key:

```bash
ssh-keygen -p -m PEM -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```

This command will ask you for the passphrase (if any) of the key. After you enter it, it will write the RSA private key back to `~/.ssh/id_rsa`. The `-p` option tells `ssh-keygen` to change the passphrase of a private key file, `-m PEM` tells it to use the older PEM private key format instead of the new OpenSSH format, and `-f ~/.ssh/id_rsa` specifies the file to convert.

2. You do not need to convert the public key. The public key format is standard and doesn't need to be converted. The public key file (`id_rsa.pub`) can be used as is.

Please remember to backup your keys before performing any operations on them.
