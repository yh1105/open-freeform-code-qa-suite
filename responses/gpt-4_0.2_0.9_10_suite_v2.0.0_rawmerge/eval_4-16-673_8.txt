The `apt-get` package manager installs the version of the software that is available in the repository defined for your version of the operating system. If you need a newer version of a software than is available in your repository, you can download and install it from source. Here is how you can do it for cmake:

1. First, remove the existing version of cmake:

    ```bash
    sudo apt-get remove cmake
    ```

2. Then, download the latest version of cmake from the official website. At the time of writing, the latest version is 3.21.2. Replace `3.21.2` with the latest version if it has changed.

    ```bash
    wget https://github.com/Kitware/CMake/releases/download/v3.21.2/cmake-3.21.2.tar.gz
    ```

3. Extract the downloaded file:

    ```bash
    tar -xzvf cmake-3.21.2.tar.gz
    ```

4. Navigate to the extracted directory:

    ```bash
    cd cmake-3.21.2
    ```

5. Now, run the bootstrap script:

    ```bash
    ./bootstrap
    ```

6. Make the installation:

    ```bash
    make -j$(nproc)
    ```

7. Finally, install cmake:

    ```bash
    sudo make install
    ```

8. Verify the installed version of cmake:

    ```bash
    cmake --version
    ```

This should display the version you have installed.

Please note that building from source requires you to have build-essential installed. If you don't have it installed, you can install it using `sudo apt-get install build-essential`.
