The `f` before the quotation marks in a `print` statement in Python is used to denote an f-string, which is a type of string formatting. It was introduced in Python 3.6.

F-strings provide a concise and convenient way to embed expressions inside string literals for formatting. 

Here's how it works:

```python
print(f"Input directory: {args.input_directory}")
```

In this line, `{args.input_directory}` is a placeholder for the actual value of `args.input_directory`. The `f` before the string tells Python to replace the placeholder with its value.

So if `args.input_directory` was `/home/user/documents`, the output of the print statement would be:

```
Input directory: /home/user/documents
```

This is a very handy feature in Python, especially when you need to include the values of variables in strings.
