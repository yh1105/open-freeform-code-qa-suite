Creating a calendar input in VBA Excel can be done by creating a UserForm with a Calendar Control. Here's a simple step-by-step guide:

1. Open VBA Editor by pressing `Alt + F11`.

2. In the VBA Project window, right-click on your workbook name and select `Insert > UserForm`.

3. In the UserForm, go to `Toolbox` (View > Toolbox), then right-click on the Toolbox and select `Additional Controls`.

4. In the `Additional Controls` window, find and check `Microsoft Date and Time Picker Control`. Click `OK`.

5. Now, you should see the `Date and Time Picker` control in your Toolbox. Click on it and draw it on your UserForm.

6. You can now use this UserForm as a calendar input in your VBA code.

Please note that the `Microsoft Date and Time Picker Control` is not available in all versions of Office. If it's not available, you might need to use a third-party date picker or create your own custom calendar.
