Sure, here's how you can fill in the blanks for transferring native SOL:

```rust
    let ix = anchor_lang::solana_program::system_instruction::transfer(
        &user_account.key(), // the sender's public key
        &event_vault_address, // the receiver's public key
        amount,
    );
    anchor_lang::solana_program::program::invoke(
        &ix,
        &[
            user_account.clone(), // the sender's account
            ctx.accounts.system_program.clone(), // the system program account
        ],
    );
```

In this code:

- `user_account.key()` is the public key of the user's account from which SOL will be transferred.
- `event_vault_address` is the public key of the event account's vault address to which SOL will be transferred.
- `amount` is the amount of SOL to be transferred.
- `user_account.clone()` is the user's account from which SOL will be transferred.
- `ctx.accounts.system_program.clone()` is the system program account, which is necessary for the transfer instruction.
