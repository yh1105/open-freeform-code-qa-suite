You can use the numpy `amax` function to find the maximum value along a specific axis. In your case, you want to find the maximum value along the second axis (axis=1) of the third column (index 2). Here is how you can do it:

```python
import numpy as np

def getMax(matrix):
    return np.amax(matrix[:,:,2], axis=1).reshape(-1,1)
```

In this function, `matrix[:,:,2]` selects the third column from each 2D array in your 3D array. `np.amax(..., axis=1)` then finds the maximum value along the second axis of each 2D array. Finally, `reshape(-1,1)` reshapes the result into a 2D array with one column.

Here is how you can use this function:

```python
matrix = np.array([[[4, 1, 5, 2, 5, 5, 7, 8, 9, 7],
                    [7, 4, 2, 4, 7, 8, 4, 1, 3, 5],
                    [6, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 7, 6],
                    [5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 4, 3, 8, 7, 1],
                    [2, 8, 6, 7, 4, 7, 5, 5, 5, 1]],

                   [[9, 9, 5, 8, 0, 7, 3, 9, 8, 1],
                    [9, 1, 9, 5, 7, 4, 5, 4, 7, 0],
                    [1, 0, 4, 8, 7, 3, 4, 3, 8, 8],
                    [8, 1, 3, 1, 7, 0, 9, 9, 3, 8],
                    [4, 0, 2, 3, 8, 2, 0, 1, 2, 4]],

                   [[1, 6,
