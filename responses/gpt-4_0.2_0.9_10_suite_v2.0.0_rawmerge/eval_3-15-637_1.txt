The error you're experiencing could be due to a number of reasons. Here are a few things you could try:

1. **Check your SeleniumBasic version**: Ensure that you have the latest version of SeleniumBasic installed. You can download it from [here](https://github.com/florentbr/SeleniumBasic/releases).

2. **Check your browser driver**: SeleniumBasic uses browser drivers to interact with browsers. Make sure you have the correct driver for the browser you're using and that it's up-to-date. For Internet Explorer, you can download the driver from [here](https://www.selenium.dev/downloads/).

3. **Check your Internet Explorer settings**: Since you're using Internet Explorer, you need to ensure that the "Enable Protected Mode" setting is the same for all zones. To do this, go to Internet Options > Security tab, and check the "Enable Protected Mode" checkbox for Internet, Local intranet, Trusted sites, and Restricted sites.

4. **Check your references in VBA**: In VBA, go to Tools > References and make sure that Selenium Type Library is checked.

5. **Try using a different browser**: If none of the above solutions work, try using a different browser like Chrome or Firefox. You would need to download the corresponding driver for the browser you choose.

Here's how your code would look like if you were to use Chrome:

```vba
Dim driver As New WebDriver
Dim keyObj As Selenium.keys

Set keyObj = New Selenium.keys

driver.Start "chrome"
driver.Window.Maximize
driver.Get "https://www.google.com/"
```

Remember to replace "ie" with "chrome" or "firefox" depending on the browser you choose.
