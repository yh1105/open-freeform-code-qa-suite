Sure, here is how you can fill the blanks in your code:

```rust
    let ix = anchor_lang::solana_program::system_instruction::transfer(
        &user_account.key(), // sender's public key
        &event_vault_address, // receiver's public key
        amount,
    );
    anchor_lang::solana_program::program::invoke(
        &ix,
        &[
            user_account.clone(), // sender's account info
            ctx.accounts.system_program.clone(), // system program account info
        ],
    );
```

In this code:

- `user_account` is the account of the user who is sending the SOL.
- `event_vault_address` is the address of the event account's vault where the SOL is being sent.
- `amount` is the amount of SOL being sent.
- `ctx.accounts.system_program` is the account info for the system program, which is needed for the `invoke` function.

Please replace `user_account`, `event_vault_address`, and `amount` with your actual variables.
