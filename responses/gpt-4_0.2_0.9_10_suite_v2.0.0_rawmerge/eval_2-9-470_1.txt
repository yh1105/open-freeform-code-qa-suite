This error is due to the `ffi` gem not being able to find the `libffi.so.6` library. This library is a part of the `libffi` package, which provides a portable, high level programming interface to various calling conventions.

The problem might be that the `libffi` package is not installed or the `ffi` gem is not properly linked to it. Here are the steps to fix this issue:

1. First, install the `libffi` package. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
sudo apt-get install libffi-dev
```

2. After the `libffi` package is installed, you need to reinstall the `ffi` gem. You can do this by running the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
gem uninstall ffi
gem install ffi
```

If you are using bundler, you might need to run `bundle install` again.

3. If the problem persists, it might be due to the `ffi` gem not being properly linked to the `libffi.so.6` library. You can fix this by creating a symbolic link to the `libffi.so.6` library. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
sudo ln -s /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libffi.so.7 /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libffi.so.6
```

This command creates a symbolic link from `/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libffi.so.7` to `/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libffi.so.6`. This means that when the `ffi` gem tries to find the `libffi.so.6` library, it will be redirected to the `libffi.so.7` library.

After following these steps, the `ffi` gem should be able to find the `libffi.so.6` library and the error should be resolved.
