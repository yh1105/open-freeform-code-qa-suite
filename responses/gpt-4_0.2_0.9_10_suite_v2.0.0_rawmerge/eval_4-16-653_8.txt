You can use the `date` command in Unix to convert the date format. Here's how you can do it:

```bash
while IFS= read -r line
do
    d=$(date -d "${line}" +"%d %b %Y")
    echo $d
done < filename.txt
```

This script reads each line from the file `filename.txt`, converts the date to the desired format (`%d %b %Y`), and then prints it. 

Note: This script assumes that the date in the file is in a format that the `date` command can understand. If the date format in the file is not recognized by the `date` command, you may need to preprocess the date string before passing it to `date`.
