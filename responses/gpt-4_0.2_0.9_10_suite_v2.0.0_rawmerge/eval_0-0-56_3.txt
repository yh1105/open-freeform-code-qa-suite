The issue you're experiencing is likely due to Vite's server defaulting to localhost (127.0.0.1). This means it's only accessible from within the Docker container itself. To make it accessible from outside the container, you need to bind the server to 0.0.0.0.

You can do this by modifying your `vite.config.ts` file as follows:

```typescript
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import vue from '@vitejs/plugin-vue'

// https://vitejs.dev/config/
export default defineConfig({
    resolve: { alias: { '@': '/src' } },
    plugins: [vue()],
    server: {
        host: '0.0.0.0', // Add this line
        port: 8080
    }
})
```

This tells Vite to listen on all network interfaces, not just localhost, so it will be accessible from outside the Docker container. After making this change, you should be able to access your Vite server from your host machine.
