In Kotlin, you can use the `ArrayList` constructor with an initial capacity if you know the eventual number of elements in advance. This can help to optimize performance by minimizing the number of resizes. Here's how you can do it:

```kotlin
val list = ArrayList<Int>(initialCapacity)
```

This is perfectly idiomatic in Kotlin, as `ArrayList` is a `MutableList`. So, your first option is the recommended one.
