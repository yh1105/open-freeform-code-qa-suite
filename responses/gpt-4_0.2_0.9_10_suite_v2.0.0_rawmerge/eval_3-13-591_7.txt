The reason why you're seeing the log "2" before "1" is because of the asynchronous nature of the `onItemSelectedListener`. The `onItemSelected` function is called when an item is selected from the spinner, which happens after your function `setupListWithAdapter` has already returned `itemSelected`.

In other words, the `return itemSelected` line is executed before the `onItemSelected` function is called, hence why you're seeing the log "2" before "1". This is also why `itemSelected` is empty when it's returned - because `onItemSelected` hasn't been called yet.

To solve this issue, you could use a callback function to return the selected item. Here's an example:

```kotlin
fun Spinner.setupListWithAdapter(list: MutableList<String>, callback: (String) -> Unit) {
    val adapter = ArrayAdapter(context, android.R.layout.simple_spinner_item, list)
    adapter.setDropDownViewResource(android.R.layout.simple_spinner_dropdown_item)
    this.adapter = adapter
    this.onItemSelectedListener = object : AdapterView.OnItemSelectedListener {
        override fun onItemSelected(p0: AdapterView<*>?, p1: View?, p2: Int, p3: Long) {
            val itemSelected = list[p2]
            Log.e("categoryLog","1 : " + itemSelected)
            callback(itemSelected)
        }
        override fun onNothingSelected(p0: AdapterView<*>?) {
        }
    }
}
```

You can then use this function like this:

```kotlin
mySpinner.setupListWithAdapter(myList) { selectedItem ->
    // Do something with selectedItem
}
```

In this example, `selectedItem` is the item that was selected from the spinner. The code inside the `{}` will be executed whenever an item is selected.
