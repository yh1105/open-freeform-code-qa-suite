You should use `@Configuration` when you want to define beans explicitly in code, typically via `@Bean` methods. This is often used when the bean cannot be automatically discovered by component scanning or when you want to create a bean with specific settings that cannot be achieved with `@Service/@Controller/@Component`.

`@Service/@Controller/@Component` are used for defining beans that can be automatically discovered by component scanning. They are typically used for defining service, controller, and general component beans respectively. 

So, if you want to define a bean that should be created with specific settings or if the bean cannot be automatically discovered, use `@Configuration`. Otherwise, use `@Service/@Controller/@Component`.
