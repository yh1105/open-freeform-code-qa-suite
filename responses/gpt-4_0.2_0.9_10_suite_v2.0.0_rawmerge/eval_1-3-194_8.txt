You can use the `openpyxl` library in Python to write to an Excel file. Here is the function `writeToExcel` that you requested:

```python
from openpyxl import Workbook

def writeExcel():
    new_list = [["first", "second"], ["third", "fourth"]]
    wb = Workbook()  # Create a new workbook
    ws = wb.active  # Get the active worksheet

    # Write rows to the worksheet
    for i in range(len(new_list)):
        ws.append(new_list[i])

    # Save the workbook
    wb.save("data.xlsx")
```

This function creates a new Excel workbook, gets the active worksheet, writes each list in `new_list` as a row in the worksheet, and then saves the workbook as "data.xlsx".

Please note that you need to install `openpyxl` library if it's not already installed. You can install it using pip:

```shell
pip install openpyxl
```
