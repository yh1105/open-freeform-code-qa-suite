In Tailwind CSS, you don't directly select elements like you do in traditional CSS. Instead, you apply utility classes directly to the elements you want to style. 

So, if you want to style the direct children of a `div` with class "section", you would apply the styles directly to those child `div` elements in your HTML.

Here's an example:

```html
<div class="section">
  <div class="bg-red-500"> <!-- Apply your styles here -->
    <!-- Content -->
  </div>
  <div class="text-blue-500"> <!-- Apply your styles here -->
    <!-- Content -->
  </div>
</div>
```

In this example, `bg-red-500` and `text-blue-500` are Tailwind CSS utility classes that apply specific styles. You would replace these with whatever styles you want to apply to the direct children of your `.section` div.

If you want to apply the same styles to all direct children, you would need to add the same classes to each child. If you have a lot of direct children and don't want to add the classes to each one, you might want to consider using a preprocessor like PostCSS or Sass, which can help you automate this.
