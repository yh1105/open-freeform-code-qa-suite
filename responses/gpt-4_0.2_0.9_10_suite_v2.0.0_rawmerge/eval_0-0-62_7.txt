The error message is indicating that Vue.js is expecting a primitive value (string or number) as the key in your `v-for` loop, but it's getting a non-primitive value (probably an object) instead.

In your case, you're using `comment` as the key in your `v-for` loop:

```html
<div v-for="comment in comments" :key="comment">
```

If `comment` is an object (which it seems to be, since you're accessing properties like `comment.text`, `comment.by`, etc.), that's what's causing the error.

To fix this, you should use a unique primitive value from each `comment` as the key. If each comment has a unique id, for example, you could do:

```html
<div v-for="comment in comments" :key="comment.id">
```

This way, Vue can track each node's identity and optimize re-rendering.
