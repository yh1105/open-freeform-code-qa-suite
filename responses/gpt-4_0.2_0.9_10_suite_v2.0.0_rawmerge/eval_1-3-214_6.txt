The error message you're seeing is due to a change in the pandas library. The `join_axes` parameter was deprecated in pandas 0.25 and removed in pandas 1.0. 

The `pandas_profiling` library you're using seems to be not compatible with the version of pandas you have installed. 

You can try to downgrade your pandas version to 0.25.3 or upgrade your pandas_profiling to the latest version.

To downgrade pandas, you can use the following command:

```bash
conda install pandas=0.25.3
```

To upgrade pandas_profiling, you can use the following command:

```bash
pip install --upgrade pandas_profiling
```

If you still encounter the same problem after upgrading pandas_profiling, you can try to use the latest version from the GitHub repository:

```bash
pip install https://github.com/pandas-profiling/pandas-profiling/archive/master.zip
```

Remember to restart your Jupyter notebook after installing or upgrading the packages.
