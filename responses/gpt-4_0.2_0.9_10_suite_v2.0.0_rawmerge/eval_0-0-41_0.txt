The `navigator.geolocation` object is available in the user's browser, but it doesn't mean that the user has granted permission to access their location. The `navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition()` method is asynchronous and takes two callbacks as arguments: the first one is called when the location is successfully retrieved, and the second one is called when an error occurs (e.g., the user denies the location request).

Here's how you can modify your code:

```javascript
if (navigator.geolocation) {
    navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(
        position => {
            console.log("Location accessed");
        },
        error => {
            console.log("User not allowed");
        }
    );
} else {
    console.log("Geolocation is not supported by this browser.");
}
```

In this code, if the geolocation is available and the user allows access to their location, "Location accessed" will be logged. If the user denies access, "User not allowed" will be logged. If the geolocation is not available at all, "Geolocation is not supported by this browser." will be logged.
