The error you're getting is because you're trying to import the Bootstrap variables before you define your own. The `!default` flag in SASS means that the variable should only be assigned if it hasn't been assigned yet. So, you should define your own variables before importing the Bootstrap ones.

Here's how you can do it:

```scss
$theme-colors: (
  "primary": #your-color, // replace #your-color with your desired color
  "secondary": #6c757d,
  "success": #198754,
  "info": #0dcaf0,
  "warning": #ffc107,
  "danger": #dc3545,
  "light": #f8f9fa,
  "dark": #212529
);

@import "../../node_modules/bootstrap/scss/bootstrap";
```

In this code, you're defining your own `$theme-colors` map before importing the Bootstrap SCSS files. This way, when the Bootstrap SCSS files are imported, the `$theme-colors` map has already been defined, so the `!default` flag prevents it from being redefined.

Remember to replace `#your-color` with the actual color you want to use for the primary theme color.
