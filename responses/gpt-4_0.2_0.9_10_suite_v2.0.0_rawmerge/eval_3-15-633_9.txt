Yes, you can achieve the same result using an array formula with `INDEX` and `SMALL` functions. Here's how you can do it:

```excel
=IFERROR(INDEX($B$1:$B$100, SMALL(IF($A$1:$A$100="x", ROW($A$1:$A$100)-ROW(INDEX($A$1:$A$100,1,1))+1), ROW(1:1))), "")
```

This is an array formula, so you need to press `Ctrl+Shift+Enter` after typing it, instead of just `Enter`. This will surround the formula with `{}` brackets, indicating it's an array formula.

This formula will return the first match. To get the next match, drag the formula down.

This formula works by creating an array of row numbers where column A is "x", then using the `SMALL` function to get the nth smallest value from that array, where n is the current row number. The `INDEX` function then returns the value from column B at that row number.

Please adjust the range `$B$1:$B$100` and `$A$1:$A$100` according to your data.
