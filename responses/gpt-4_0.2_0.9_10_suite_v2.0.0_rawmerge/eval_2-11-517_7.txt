In C++, string interpolation isn't as straightforward as in C# or JavaScript. However, you can achieve similar results using `std::ostringstream` or `std::to_string` or `printf` function. Here are some examples:

1. Using `std::ostringstream`:

```cpp
#include <sstream>

int myVariable = 5;
std::ostringstream oss;
oss << "My variable has value " << myVariable;
std::string result = oss.str();
```

2. Using `std::to_string`:

```cpp
int myVariable = 5;
std::string result = "My variable has value " + std::to_string(myVariable);
```

3. Using `printf`:

```cpp
int myVariable = 5;
printf("My variable has value %d", myVariable);
```

Please note that the `printf` function will not return a string, it will directly print the output.

Also, if you are using C++20, you can use `std::format`:

```cpp
#include <format>

int myVariable = 5;
std::string result = std::format("My variable has value {}", myVariable);
```

This is the closest to the string interpolation syntax you're used to from C# and JavaScript, but it requires C++20.
