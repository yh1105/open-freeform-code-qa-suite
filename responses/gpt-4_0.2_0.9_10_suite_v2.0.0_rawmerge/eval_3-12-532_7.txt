The error you're getting is due to the fact that the response you're receiving from your server is not a valid JSON string. This could be due to a number of reasons:

1. The server might not be returning a JSON response at all.
2. The server might be returning a JSON response but with some leading or trailing characters that make it invalid.
3. The server might be returning a JSON response but with an incorrect content type.

Here are some steps you can take to debug and solve this issue:

1. **Print the server response**: Before trying to decode the response, print it to the console. This will give you an idea of what you're dealing with.

```dart
print('Response body: ${response.body}');
```

2. **Check the server's response headers**: The server should be returning a `Content-Type` of `application/json`. If it's not, that might be the cause of the problem.

```dart
print('Response headers: ${response.headers}');
```

3. **Check the server's response status code**: If the server is returning a status code other than 200, it means that there was an error on the server side.

```dart
print('Response status: ${response.statusCode}');
```

4. **Check your server code**: Make sure that your PHP script is correctly outputting a JSON response. You should be using the `json_encode` function to convert your data to JSON, and you should be setting the `Content-Type` header to `application/json`.

```php
header('Content-Type: application/json');
echo json_encode($data);
```

5. **Handle the FormatException**: You can use a try-catch block to handle the `FormatException` and print a more descriptive error message.

```dart
try {
  List data = json.decode(response.body);
} catch (e) {
  print('Error decoding JSON: $e');
}
```

By following these steps, you should be able to identify and fix the problem.
