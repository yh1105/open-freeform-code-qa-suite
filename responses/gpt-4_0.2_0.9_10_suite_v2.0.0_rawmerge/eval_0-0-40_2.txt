The error message you're seeing is due to a conflict between the Windows and WSL versions of Node.js and npm. The Windows version of npm is being called instead of the WSL version, and because the Windows version is a DOS program, it can't be run directly in WSL.

You can solve this problem by adding the following lines to your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc` file:

```bash
export PATH="/usr/bin:$PATH"
```

This line will ensure that the WSL versions of Node.js and npm are found first when you type `node` or `npm`.

After adding this line, you need to source your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc` file to apply the changes:

```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```

or

```bash
source ~/.zshrc
```

Now, when you type `node -v` or `npm -v`, you should see the versions of Node.js and npm that you installed in WSL.

If you still face the issue, you might need to reinstall `npm` using the following command:

```bash
sudo apt-get install -y npm
```

And then check the version again:

```bash
npm -v
```
