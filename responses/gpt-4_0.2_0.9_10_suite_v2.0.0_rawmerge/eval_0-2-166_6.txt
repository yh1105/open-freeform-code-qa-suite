Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs. It doesn't provide a direct way to target child elements like you would do in CSS with the `>` operator. 

Tailwind CSS operates by adding utility classes directly to HTML elements, rather than defining CSS selectors and rules in a separate stylesheet. 

So, if you want to style direct children of a `div` with class "section", you would need to add the necessary Tailwind classes directly to those child `div` elements in your HTML.

Here's an example:

```html
<div class="section">
  <div class="bg-blue-500 text-white">...</div> <!-- Tailwind classes added directly -->
  <div class="p-4">...</div> <!-- Tailwind classes added directly -->
</div>
```

In this example, `bg-blue-500` and `text-white` are Tailwind classes added to the first child `div`, and `p-4` is a Tailwind class added to the second child `div`.

If you need to apply styles to child elements based on their parent, you might need to use JavaScript to dynamically add classes, or consider using a CSS preprocessor like Sass or Less in combination with Tailwind.
