Sure, here's your revised code. The problem was that you were returning the word immediately in the first iteration of the loop, which was ending the function prematurely. You need to append each transformed word to a list and then join them into a string at the end.

```python
def pig_latin(text):
    words = text.split()
    pig_latin_words = []
    for word in words:
        endString = word[1:] + word[0].lower() + 'ay'
        pig_latin_words.append(endString)
    return ' '.join(pig_latin_words)
```
