There could be several reasons why you're unable to start a Jupyter notebook on VS Code. Here are a few potential solutions:

1. **Check your Python interpreter**: Make sure you have selected the correct Python interpreter for your virtual environment. You can do this by clicking on the Python version in the bottom left corner of the VS Code status bar, and then selecting the interpreter that corresponds to your 'da38' environment.

2. **Check your Jupyter server**: Try starting a Jupyter server manually from the command line to see if there are any issues. You can do this by activating your 'da38' environment and then running `jupyter notebook`.

3. **Reinstall the Python extension**: There might be an issue with your Python extension in VS Code. Try uninstalling and then reinstalling the extension.

4. **Reinstall Jupyter**: There might be an issue with your Jupyter installation. Try uninstalling Jupyter (`conda remove jupyter`) and then reinstalling it (`conda install jupyter`).

5. **Check your VS Code settings**: There might be an issue with your VS Code settings. Try resetting your settings to the default and see if that resolves the issue.

6. **Check your firewall settings**: Your firewall might be blocking the connection to the Jupyter server. Try disabling your firewall temporarily to see if that resolves the issue.

If none of these solutions work, please provide more information about your setup (e.g., the exact version of VS Code and the Python extension you're using, any error messages you're seeing in the VS Code output or terminal, etc.) so we can help you troubleshoot further.
