The error message you're seeing is due to the Django URL dispatcher not being able to find a match for the URL pattern you've specified in your template. The `NoReverseMatch` error is raised when Django tries to generate a URL from a view name and arguments, but can't find a matching URL pattern.

The problem lies in this line in your `index.html` template:

```html
<a href="{% url 'profile' post.author.username %}">@{{post.author.username}}</a>
```

The error message suggests that `post.author.username` is empty, which is why the arguments are `('',)`. This means that there is a post in your database that has no author associated with it, or the author does not have a username.

To fix this, you could add a check in your template to ensure that `post.author.username` exists before trying to create the URL:

```html
{% if post.author and post.author.username %}
    <a href="{% url 'profile' post.author.username %}">@{{post.author.username}}</a>
{% endif %}
```

This will prevent the `NoReverseMatch` error from occurring when a post's author or the author's username is `None`.

Also, make sure that when you create a `NewPost` instance, the `author` field is always filled with a valid `User` instance.
