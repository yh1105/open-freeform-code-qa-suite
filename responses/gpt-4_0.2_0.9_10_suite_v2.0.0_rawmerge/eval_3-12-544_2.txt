The error you're seeing is due to the fact that you're trying to access platform-specific code before `runApp()` has been called. In Flutter, you cannot access platform channels before `runApp()` is called, because the binding with the host platform is not yet complete.

To fix this, you need to ensure that `WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized()` is called first. This method initializes the binding between the Flutter framework and the platform-specific code.

Here's how you can modify your code:

```dart
void main() async {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  final appDocsDir = await getApplicationDocumentsDirectory();
  Hive.init(appDocsDir.path);
  runApp(MyApp());
}
```

This should resolve the error you're seeing.
