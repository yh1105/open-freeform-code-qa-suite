In R, you can't have two columns with the same name in a data frame. When you bind two data frames with the same column names using `cbind()`, R will automatically rename the columns to make them unique. 

In your case, the second column will be named `a.1`. You can select the second column by its name like this:

```r
second_col <- d3$a.1
```

If you insist on having two columns with the same name, you can use a list instead of a data frame. However, this is generally not recommended because it can lead to confusion and errors.
