You can use the `Split` function in VBA to split a string into an array based on a delimiter (like a space or a comma). Here's how you can modify your code to split the data into 5 separate columns:

```vba
idx = InStr(textline, "Cabinet No.")
If idx > 0 Then
    Line Input #1, textline
    Line Input #1, textline
    Dim splitData() As String
    splitData = Split(textline, " ") ' Assuming space is the delimiter
    For i = 0 To UBound(splitData)
        ActiveSheet.Cells(nextrow, "G" + i).Value = splitData(i)
    Next i
    nextrow = nextrow + 1 'now move to next row
End If
```

This code will split the `textline` into an array `splitData` and then loop through this array to put each element into a separate column. Adjust the delimiter in the `Split` function as per your requirement.
