The error you're getting is because the latest version of Devise is not compatible with the version of Rails you're using. 

To fix this issue, you can specify a version of Devise that is compatible with your Rails version in your Gemfile. 

For example, if you're using Rails 5.2, you can use Devise 4.7.1. 

To do this, you can modify your Gemfile like this:

```ruby
gem 'devise', '~> 4.7.1'
```

After modifying the Gemfile, run `bundle install` to install the specified version of Devise.

If you're not sure which version of Devise is compatible with your Rails version, you can check the [Devise GitHub page](https://github.com/heartcombo/devise) for more information.
