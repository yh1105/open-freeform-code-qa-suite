The `apt-get install` command installs the version of the package that is available in the repositories configured for your system. If the latest version of cmake is not available in these repositories, `apt-get install cmake` will not install the latest version.

To install the latest version of cmake, you can download it from the official website and compile it from source. Here are the steps:

1. First, uninstall the existing version of cmake:

```bash
sudo apt-get remove cmake
```

2. Download the latest version of cmake from the official website. At the time of writing, the latest version is 3.21.1. Replace `3.21.1` with the latest version if it's different:

```bash
wget https://github.com/Kitware/CMake/releases/download/v3.21.1/cmake-3.21.1.tar.gz
```

3. Extract the downloaded file:

```bash
tar -xzvf cmake-3.21.1.tar.gz
```

4. Go to the extracted directory:

```bash
cd cmake-3.21.1
```

5. Run the bootstrap script:

```bash
./bootstrap
```

6. Compile the source code:

```bash
make
```

7. Install cmake:

```bash
sudo make install
```

8. Verify the installed version of cmake:

```bash
cmake --version
```

This should display the version of cmake that you just installed.
