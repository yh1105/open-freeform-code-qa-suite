Font Awesome 5 has made some changes to how it works compared to Font Awesome 4. Here's how you can modify your CSS to work with Font Awesome 5:

```css
#mainNav .navbar-collapse .navbar-sidenav .nav-link-collapse:after {
  float: right;
  content: "\f107";
  font-family: "Font Awesome 5 Free"; /* Change the font-family */
  font-weight: 900; /* Add font-weight */
}
```

In Font Awesome 5, the font family has been changed to "Font Awesome 5 Free" for free icons and "Font Awesome 5 Pro" for pro icons. Also, you need to specify the `font-weight`. For solid icons, use `font-weight: 900;`, for regular icons use `font-weight: 400;`, and for light icons use `font-weight: 300;`.

Please note that the unicode for the icon (`\f107` in your case) may also have changed in Font Awesome 5. You can check the correct unicode for your icon on the Font Awesome website.
