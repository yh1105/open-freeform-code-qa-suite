To change the color of the accordion arrow in Bootstrap 5, you need to target the `.accordion-button::after` pseudo-element in your CSS. This pseudo-element is responsible for the arrow icon.

Here is an example of how you can change the color to green:

```css
.accordion-button:not(.collapsed)::after {
    /* This is the arrow when the accordion is expanded */
    color: green;
}

.accordion-button::after {
    /* This is the arrow when the accordion is collapsed */
    color: green;
}
```

You can put this CSS in your main CSS file or in a `<style>` tag in your HTML file. This will change the color of the arrow to green both when the accordion is collapsed and when it is expanded.
