The `_io.BytesIO` object is a type of I/O stream for handling binary data. It's already a bytes-like object, but the issue you're encountering is likely because the `zlib.decompress()` function expects a bytes object, not a stream.

You can convert the `_io.BytesIO` object to a bytes object by calling the `getvalue()` method on the `_io.BytesIO` object. Here's how you can modify your function:

```python
def uncompress_body(self, compression_type, body):
    if isinstance(body, _io.BytesIO):
        body = body.getvalue()
        
    if compression_type == 'gzip' or compression_type == 'compress':
        return zlib.decompress(body)
    elif compression_type == 'deflate':
        compressor = zlib.compressobj(9, zlib.DEFLATED, -zlib.MAX_WBITS)
        compressed = compressor.compress(body)
        compressed += compressor.flush()
        return base64.b64encode(compressed)

    return body
```

This code checks if `body` is an instance of `_io.BytesIO`. If it is, it converts `body` to a bytes object using `getvalue()`. Then, it proceeds with the decompression as before.
