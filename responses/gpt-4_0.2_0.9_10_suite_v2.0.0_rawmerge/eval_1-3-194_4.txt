You can use the `openpyxl` library in Python to write to an Excel file. If you don't have it installed, you can install it using pip:

```bash
pip install openpyxl
```

Here is the function `writeToExcel` that writes a list of lists to an Excel file:

```python
from openpyxl import Workbook

def writeExcel():
    new_list = [["first", "second"], ["third", "fourth"]]

    # Create a workbook and select the active worksheet
    wb = Workbook()
    ws = wb.active

    # Write the data to the worksheet
    for i in range(len(new_list)):
        for j in range(len(new_list[i])):
            ws.cell(row=i+1, column=j+1, value=new_list[i][j])

    # Save the workbook
    wb.save("data.xlsx")
```

This function creates a new Excel workbook, selects the active worksheet, writes the data from the list to the worksheet, and then saves the workbook as "data.xlsx". The `ws.cell()` method is used to write data to a specific cell, and it takes the row number, column number, and value as arguments. Note that row and column numbers in Excel start from 1, not 0.
