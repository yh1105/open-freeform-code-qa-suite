The warning message you're seeing is because Elasticsearch 7.13.1 has built-in security features that are not enabled by default. This means that without authentication, your Elasticsearch cluster could be accessible to anyone.

To fix this, you need to enable Elasticsearch's built-in security features. Here's how you can do it:

1. Open your Elasticsearch configuration file (`elasticsearch.yml`). The location of this file depends on how you installed Elasticsearch. If you used Homebrew, it's likely in `/usr/local/etc/elasticsearch/`.

2. Add the following lines to the file:

    ```yaml
    xpack.security.enabled: true
    xpack.security.transport.ssl.enabled: true
    ```

3. Save and close the file.

4. Restart Elasticsearch. If you installed it with Homebrew, you can use the command `brew services restart elasticsearch`.

Please note that enabling security will require you to use a username and password when accessing your Elasticsearch cluster. The default username is `elastic`. To set the password, you can use the `elasticsearch-setup-passwords` command-line tool, which you can run with `bin/elasticsearch-setup-passwords interactive`.

Also, keep in mind that enabling security might require changes to your Rails application if it's using Elasticsearch. You'll need to update your Searchkick configuration to include the username and password. Here's an example:

```ruby
Searchkick.client = Elasticsearch::Client.new(
  hosts: ["localhost:9200"],
  transport_options: {
    request: { timeout: 5 }
  },
  user: 'elastic', # username
  password: 'password' # password
)
```

Remember to replace `'password'` with the actual password you set up for the `elastic` user.
