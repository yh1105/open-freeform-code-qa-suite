The `ext-zip` is a PHP extension for handling zip archives. It's not a Composer package, so you cannot install it using `composer require`.

If you are using a Unix-like operating system, you can install it via the terminal:

```bash
sudo apt-get install php-zip
```

If you are using Windows, you can enable it in your `php.ini` file by uncommenting the line:

```ini
extension=php_zip.dll
```

After installing or enabling the extension, you should restart your web server to make the changes take effect.

If you want to specify that your project requires the `ext-zip` extension, you can add it to the `require` section of your `composer.json` file:

```json
"require": {
    "php": "^7.1.3",
    "ext-zip": "*",
    // other dependencies...
}
```

This won't install the extension, but when someone tries to install your project using Composer, they will get a warning if they don't have the `ext-zip` extension installed.
