To remove the spaces from your output, you can simply replace the space character with an empty string. You can do this by modifying the line where you replace the special characters with a space to replace them with an empty string instead. 

Here's the modified code:

```vba
Sub ReplaceSpecial()
    Dim cel As Range
    Dim strVal As String
    Dim i As Long
    Application.ScreenUpdating = False
    For Each cel In Selection
        strVal = cel.Value
        For i = 1 To Len(strVal)
            Select Case Asc(Mid(strVal, i, 1))
                Case 32, 48 To 57, 65 To 90, 97 To 122
                    ' Leave ordinary characters alone
                Case Else
                    Mid(strVal, i, 1) = "" ' replace with empty string instead of space
            End Select
        Next i
        cel.Value = strVal
    Next cel
    Application.ScreenUpdating = True
End Sub
```

Please note that the `Mid` function in VBA is not able to replace a character with an empty string. So, you need to use a different approach to remove the special characters. Here is a modified version of your code that should work:

```vba
Sub ReplaceSpecial()
    Dim cel As Range
    Dim strVal As String
    Dim i As Long
    Dim tempStr As String
    Application.ScreenUpdating = False
    For Each cel In Selection
        strVal = cel.Value
        tempStr = ""
        For i = 1 To Len(strVal)
            Select Case Asc(Mid(strVal, i, 1))
                Case 48 To 57, 65 To 90, 97 To 122
                    tempStr = tempStr & Mid(strVal, i, 1)
            End Select
        Next i
        cel.Value = tempStr
    Next cel
    Application.ScreenUpdating = True
End Sub
```

In this version of the code, a temporary string (`tempStr`) is used to build the new string without the special characters. The `Mid` function is used to append each character that is not a special character to `tempStr`. Finally, the cell's value is replaced with `tempStr`.
