The `~/.bashrc` file is not sourced when you run a non-interactive shell, which is the case when you run a Docker container. 

In your Dockerfile, you are using `/bin/sh` to run your `launch.sh` script. This will not source `~/.bashrc`. 

To solve this issue, you can source `~/.bashrc` manually in your `launch.sh` script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

source ~/.bashrc

cd /workspace/demo
npm install
node index.js
```

Or, you can change the shebang in your `launch.sh` script to use `bash` in login mode, which will source `~/.bashrc`:

```bash
#!/bin/bash -l

cd /workspace/demo
npm install
node index.js
```

Remember to make your `launch.sh` script executable by adding the following line in your Dockerfile:

```dockerfile
RUN chmod +x /workspace/launch.sh
```

And then change your CMD to:

```dockerfile
CMD ["/workspace/launch.sh"]
```
