To conform to `ShapeStyle` protocol, you need to implement a method that provides a `Shader` given a `Rect` and `ColorScheme`. Here is how you can do it:

```swift
struct RedView: ShapeStyle {
    func _apply(to shape: inout _ShapeStyle_ShapeType, context: inout _ShapeStyle_Context) {
    }
}
```

However, this is a private API and not recommended for use. 

In SwiftUI, `ShapeStyle` is a protocol that types like `Color`, `Gradient`, `AngularGradient`, `RadialGradient` conform to. It's not designed to be conformed to by custom types. 

If you want to fill a shape with a custom view, you should use a `ViewModifier` or a custom `Shape` instead. 

Here is an example of how you can create a custom `ViewModifier`:

```swift
struct MyContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        Circle()
            .modifier(RedModifier())
    }
}

struct RedModifier: ViewModifier {
    func body(content: Content) -> some View {
        content
            .foregroundColor(.red)
    }
}
```

In this example, `RedModifier` changes the foreground color of the shape to red.
