To conform to the `ShapeStyle` protocol, you need to implement the `func _apply(to shape: inout _ShapeStyle_ShapeType)` method. However, this method is not intended for direct use in your code. 

Instead, you can create a struct that conforms to `ShapeStyle` and use a `Color` to fill your shape. Here's how you can do it:

```swift
struct MyContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        Circle()
            .fill(RedShapeStyle())
    }
}

struct RedShapeStyle: ShapeStyle {
    func _apply(to shape: inout _ShapeStyle_ShapeType) {
        Color.red._apply(to: &shape)
    }
}
```

Please note that `_ShapeStyle_ShapeType` and `_apply(to:)` are underscored because they are not part of the public API and may change in future versions of SwiftUI.
