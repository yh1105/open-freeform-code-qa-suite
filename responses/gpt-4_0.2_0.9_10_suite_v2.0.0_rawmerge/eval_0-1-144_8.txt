You can change the color of the accordion arrow by targeting the `::after` pseudo-element of the `.accordion-button` class. The arrow is created using this pseudo-element, so changing its color will change the arrow color.

Here's how you can do it:

```css
.accordion-button::after {
    /* You may want to include !important to override any existing styles */
    color: green !important; 
}
```

This CSS rule will change the color of the arrow to green. You can replace `green` with any color you want.

Please note that the `!important` rule is used to ensure that this style overrides any other potentially conflicting styles. However, it's generally recommended to avoid using `!important` if possible, as it can make debugging and maintenance more difficult. If you find that the style isn't being applied without `!important`, it may be due to other styles having higher specificity. In such cases, you should try to increase the specificity of your selector or refactor your CSS to avoid the conflict.
