Sure, you can use the `group-hover` feature of Tailwind CSS to achieve this. Here's how you can do it:

```html
<a href="#" class="group">
    Link
    <span class="block w-0 h-0.5 bg-sky-600 transition-all duration-500 group-hover:w-full"></span>
</a>
```

In the above code, I've added the `group-hover:w-full` class to the `span` element. This means that when you hover over the parent element with the `group` class, the width of the `span` element will transition to full width.

Please note that for `group-hover` to work, you need to enable it in your Tailwind CSS configuration file (`tailwind.config.js`) like this:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  variants: {
    extend: {
      width: ['group-hover'],
    },
  },
  plugins: [],
}
```

This configuration will enable the `group-hover` variant for the `width` utility. After making this change, you need to rebuild your CSS.
