Here is a Python function that generates a 16 character code according to your requirements:

```python
import random
import string

def generateRandomString():
    # Generate a list of 16 random characters
    code = [random.choice(string.ascii_letters) for _ in range(16)]
    
    # Replace 3 random positions with digits
    for i in random.sample(range(16), 3):
        code[i] = str(random.randint(0, 9))
    
    # Insert "NAA3U" at a random position
    pos = random.randint(0, 11)
    code[pos:pos+5] = list("NAA3U")
    
    return "".join(code)
```

This function first generates a list of 16 random letters. Then it replaces 3 random positions with digits. Finally, it inserts "NAA3U" at a random position.

Please note that the position of "NAA3U" is randomly chosen from 0 to 11 (inclusive) to ensure that the entire substring can fit into the 16 character code.
