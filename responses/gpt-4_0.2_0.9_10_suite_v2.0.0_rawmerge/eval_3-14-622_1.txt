To conform to `ShapeStyle` in SwiftUI, you need to create a struct that conforms to the `ShapeStyle` protocol. This protocol has a single requirement, a `makeBody` function that takes a `Rect` and returns a `some View`.

Here is how you can conform to `ShapeStyle`:

```swift
struct RedShapeStyle: ShapeStyle {
    func makeBody(configuration: Configuration) -> some View {
        Color.red
    }
}

struct MyContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        Circle()
            .fill(RedShapeStyle())
    }
}
```

In this code, `RedShapeStyle` is a struct that conforms to `ShapeStyle` and returns a red color. You can then use this `RedShapeStyle` to fill your `Circle` in `MyContentView`.
