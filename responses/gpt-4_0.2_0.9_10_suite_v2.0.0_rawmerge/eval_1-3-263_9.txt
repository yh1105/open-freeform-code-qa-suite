The `f` before the string in the `print` function is used to create what's called an f-string (formatted string literal) in Python. It was introduced in Python 3.6.

F-strings provide a concise and convenient way to embed expressions inside string literals for formatting. 

Here's how it works:

```python
name = "John"
print(f"Hello, {name}")
```

In this example, the expression inside the curly braces `{}` is evaluated and its result is inserted into the string. The output will be `Hello, John`.

In your code:

```python
print(f"Input directory: {args.input_directory}")
print(f"Output directory: {args.output_directory}")
```

`args.input_directory` and `args.output_directory` are expressions that get evaluated and their results are inserted into the strings. The `args` object likely comes from argument parsing (probably using `argparse`), and `input_directory` and `output_directory` are its attributes. 

So, the output of these print statements will be something like:

```
Input directory: path_to_input_directory
Output directory: path_to_output_directory
```

where `path_to_input_directory` and `path_to_output_directory` are the values of `args.input_directory` and `args.output_directory` respectively.
