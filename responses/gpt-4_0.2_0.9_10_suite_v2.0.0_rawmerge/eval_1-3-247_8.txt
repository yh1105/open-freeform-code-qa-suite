The error message you're seeing is because Django is trying to reverse the URL for the 'profile' view with an empty string as the 'name' argument. This is happening because `post.author.username` is empty for at least one of your `NewPost` instances.

This is likely because you have a `NewPost` instance where the `author` field is `None`. Since you have `null=True` in your `NewPost` model for the `author` field, Django allows this. However, when you try to access `post.author.username` in your template, it results in an error because `None` has no attribute `username`.

To fix this, you need to ensure that every `NewPost` instance has an author. You can do this by removing `null=True` from the `author` field in your `NewPost` model:

```python
class NewPost(models.Model):
    title = models.CharField(max_length=32)
    description = models.CharField(max_length=256)
    author = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
```

After making this change, you will need to create a new database migration and apply it:

```bash
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```

Then, in your `index` view, you need to check if the user is authenticated before trying to save a new post:

```python
def index(request):
    if request.method == "POST":
        form = NewPostForm(request.POST)
        if form.is_valid():
            title = form.cleaned_data['title']
            description = form.cleaned_data['description']
            if request.user.is_authenticated:
                author = request.user

                post = NewPost(title=title, description=description, author=author)
                post.save()
                return HttpResponseRedirect(reverse("index"))
            else:
                return HttpResponseRedirect(reverse("login"))
        else:
            return render(request, "network/index.html", {
                "form": form
            })

    return render(request, "network/index.html", {
        "form": NewPostForm(),
        "posts": NewPost.objects.all()
    })
```

This will redirect unauthenticated users to the login page when they try to submit a post.
