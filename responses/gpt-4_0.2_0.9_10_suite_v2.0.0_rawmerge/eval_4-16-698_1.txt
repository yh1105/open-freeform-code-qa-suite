You can use the `source` command to reload your `.bash_profile` without closing and reopening your terminal. Here's how you can do it:

```bash
source ~/.bash_profile
```

This command will read and execute commands from the filename argument in the current shell context. If you made changes to your `.bash_profile`, this will apply them to your current session.

If you're using a different shell, you'd source that file instead. For example, if you're using zsh, you'd use:

```bash
source ~/.zshrc
```

You can also use the `.` command as a shorthand for `source`:

```bash
. ~/.bash_profile
```
