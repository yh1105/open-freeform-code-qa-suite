The warning is because Dart's null safety feature is enabled. The `Map` method `[]` returns a nullable type (`String?` in this case) because there might not be a value for the provided key. 

You can solve the warning by either checking if the value is not null before assigning it to `s`, or by using the null assertion operator (`!`) to tell Dart that you're sure the value won't be null at this point. 

Here's how you can do it:

```dart
void foo(Map<int, String> myMap) {
  if (myMap.containsKey(1)) {
    String? possibleNullString = myMap[1];
    if (possibleNullString != null) {
      String s = possibleNullString;
      // use s here
    }
  }
}
```
Or with the null assertion operator:

```dart
void foo(Map<int, String> myMap) {
  if (myMap.containsKey(1)) {
    String s = myMap[1]!;
    // use s here
  }
}
```
Please note that if you use the null assertion operator and the value is actually null, a runtime error will occur. So, use it only when you are sure that the value is not null.
