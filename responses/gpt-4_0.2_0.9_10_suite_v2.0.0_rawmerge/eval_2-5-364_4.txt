The Maven Wrapper is a shell script called `mvnw` (or `mvnw.cmd` on Windows) that automatically downloads and installs the correct version of Maven for your project. It's similar to the Gradle Wrapper. The Maven Wrapper is especially useful for projects that are built on continuous integration servers. It ensures that the Maven version used is the same as the one the project expects.

The Maven Wrapper uses the JAVA_HOME environment variable to find the Java installation it should use. If you're having trouble with the Maven Wrapper using an older version of Java, it's likely because the JAVA_HOME environment variable is set to that older version.

You can change the JAVA_HOME environment variable to point to the correct Java installation. Here's how you can do it:

**On Windows:**

1. Open the Start Menu and right click on Computer. Select Properties.
2. Click on Advanced system settings.
3. Click on Environment Variables.
4. Under System Variables, find the JAVA_HOME variable and select it. Click on Edit. If the JAVA_HOME variable does not exist, click on New.
5. In the Edit System Variable (or New System Variable) window, specify the value of the JAVA_HOME variable with the path to the JDK. Click on OK.
6. Close all remaining windows by clicking OK.

**On Unix (Linux, Mac):**

1. Open a terminal.
2. Open the profile settings file for your shell. For Bash, this is usually `~/.bashrc` or `~/.bash_profile`. For Zsh, this is usually `~/.zshrc`.
3. Add a line that exports the JAVA_HOME variable to point to your JDK. It should look something like this: `export JAVA_HOME=/path/to/your/jdk`
4. Save the file and exit the editor.
5. Run `source ~/.bashrc` (or whichever file you edited) to reload the profile settings.
6. Verify that the JAVA_HOME variable is set correctly by running `echo $JAVA_HOME`. It should print the path to your JDK.

Remember to replace `/path/to/your/jdk` with the actual path to your JDK. The exact path will depend on where you installed the JDK on your system.
