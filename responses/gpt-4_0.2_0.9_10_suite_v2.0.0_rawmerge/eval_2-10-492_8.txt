Sure, here's how you can fill in the blanks:

```rust
    let ix = anchor_lang::solana_program::system_instruction::transfer(
        &user_account.key, // the account of the user who is sending SOL
        &event_vault_address, // the address of the event account's vault
        amount,
    );
    anchor_lang::solana_program::program::invoke(
        &ix,
        &[
            user_account.clone(), // the user's account
            ctx.accounts.system_program.to_account_info(), // the system program's account
        ],
    );
```

In this code:

- `user_account` is the account of the user who is sending SOL.
- `event_vault_address` is the address of the event account's vault where the SOL will be deposited.
- `amount` is the amount of SOL to be transferred.
- `ctx.accounts.system_program.to_account_info()` is the account of the system program, which is needed to perform the transfer.
