Sure, here is the code snippet with the blanks filled:

```rust
    let ix = anchor_lang::solana_program::system_instruction::transfer(
        &user_account.key(),
        &event_vault_address,
        amount,
    );
    anchor_lang::solana_program::program::invoke(
        &ix,
        &[
            user_account.clone(),
            event_vault.clone(),
        ],
    );
```

In this code:

- `user_account` is the account of the user who is depositing SOL.
- `event_vault_address` is the address of the event account's vault where the SOL is being deposited.
- `amount` is the amount of SOL being transferred.
- `user_account.clone()` and `event_vault.clone()` are the accounts that are passed to the `invoke` function. They are cloned because the `invoke` function takes ownership of its arguments.
