The error log indicates that Python is not found in your system PATH. `node-gyp`, which is a part of the build process, requires Python to be installed and accessible.

Here are the steps to fix this issue:

1. **Install Python**: If Python is not installed on your system, download and install it. You can download Python from the official website. `node-gyp` requires Python 2.7, so make sure to install that version. Python 3.x is not compatible with `node-gyp`.

2. **Add Python to PATH**: After installing Python, you need to add it to your system PATH. Here's how to do it:

   - Open the System Properties (Right click Computer in the start menu, or use the keyboard shortcut Win+Pause)
   - Click Advanced system settings in the sidebar.
   - Click Environment Variables...
   - Select PATH in the System variables section
   - Click Edit
   - Add Python's path to the end of the list (the paths are separated by semicolons). For example, if you installed Python to `C:\Python27\`, then you would add `C:\Python27\;` to the end of the PATH.

3. **Install Windows Build Tools**: You also need to install the Windows build tools which include other dependencies required by `node-gyp`. You can do this using npm (Node.js package manager) by running the following command in the command prompt (Run as Administrator):

   ```
   npm install --global --production windows-build-tools
   ```

   This will install Python 2.7 and Microsoft Visual Studio C++ Build Tools, both are required dependencies.

4. **Rebuild node-sass**: After Python and the build tools are installed, try rebuilding `node-sass` using the following command:

   ```
   npm rebuild node-sass
   ```

After following these steps, your build should work as expected.
