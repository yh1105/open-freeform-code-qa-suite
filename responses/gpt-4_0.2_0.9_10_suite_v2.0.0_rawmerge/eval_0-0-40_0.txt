The issue you're experiencing is likely due to a conflict between the Node.js version installed on your Windows system and the one you've installed in your WSL2 Ubuntu environment. 

When you run `npm -v`, the system might be trying to execute the npm installed on your Windows system, which won't work because of the different file system and environment variables.

To solve this issue, you need to make sure that the WSL2 environment is using the Node.js and npm installed in Ubuntu, not the ones installed in Windows. 

You can do this by adding the following lines to your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc` file (depending on which shell you're using):

```bash
export PATH="/usr/bin:$PATH"
```

This line will prioritize the `/usr/bin` directory (where your Ubuntu Node.js and npm binaries are located) over other directories in your PATH.

After adding this line, you need to source your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc` file to apply the changes:

```bash
source ~/.bashrc
# or
source ~/.zshrc
```

Now, when you run `node -v` and `npm -v`, you should see the versions installed in your Ubuntu environment.
