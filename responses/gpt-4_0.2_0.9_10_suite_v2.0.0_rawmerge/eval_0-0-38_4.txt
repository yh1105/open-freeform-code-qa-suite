Sure, you can use `async/await` with `toPromise()` to make your code wait for the response. Here is the revised code:

```javascript
async getData() {
  this.newIds = await this.repository.getById(Ids).pipe(map(response => response.map(id => id))).toPromise();
  console.log(this.newIds);
}
```

Please note that you need to call `getData()` function to get the data.
