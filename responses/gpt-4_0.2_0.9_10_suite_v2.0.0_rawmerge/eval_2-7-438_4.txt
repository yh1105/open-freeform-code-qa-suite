The error message indicates that the migration class "20210909072642" was not found. This is because you need to provide the full namespace of the migration class when executing the migration.

Based on your configuration, the full namespace of your migration class should be `Application\Migrations\Version20210909072642`.

```

Please make sure that the migration class `Version20210909072642` exists in the `app/DoctrineMigrations` directory.
