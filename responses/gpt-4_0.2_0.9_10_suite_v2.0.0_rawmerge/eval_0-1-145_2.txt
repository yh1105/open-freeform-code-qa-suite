The `truncate` class in Tailwind CSS only works for single line text. It sets `overflow: hidden`, `text-overflow: ellipsis`, and `white-space: nowrap` on an element. So, if you want to truncate text that spans multiple lines, you'll need to use a different approach.

Unfortunately, Tailwind CSS does not provide a utility for multiline text truncation out of the box. However, you can achieve this by adding some custom CSS to your project.

Here is an example of how you can do it:

```css
.truncate-multiline {
  display: -webkit-box;
  -webkit-line-clamp: 2; /* number of lines to show */
  -webkit-box-orient: vertical;  
  overflow: hidden;
  text-overflow: ellipsis;
}
```

Then, you can use this class in your HTML:

```html
<div className="ml-1 inline-block">
   <span>Label: </span>
   <span className="font-semibold truncate-multiline">
     long texttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttt
   </span>
</div>
```

This will truncate the text after 2 lines. You can adjust the `-webkit-line-clamp` value to show more or fewer lines before truncating.

Please note that this solution uses `-webkit-` prefixed properties, which means it may not work in all browsers. It is supported in most modern browsers, but not in IE.
