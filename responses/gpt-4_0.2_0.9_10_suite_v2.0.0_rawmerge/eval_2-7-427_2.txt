## CSRF Token Mismatch

The CSRF token mismatch issue could be due to several reasons. Here are a few things you could check:

1. **Domain Configuration**: Ensure that your domain is correctly configured. If you're using a www version (www.example.com) and a non-www version (example.com), Laravel might treat them as two different sessions. Make sure to redirect all traffic to either the www or non-www version.

2. **Cookie Configuration**: Check your `config/session.php` file and ensure that the `domain` attribute is correctly set. If your application is on a subdomain, you should set the domain attribute to your root domain and prefix it with a dot. For example, '.example.com'.

3. **Middleware**: Ensure that the `VerifyCsrfToken` middleware is included in your middleware group in `app/Http/Kernel.php`.

4. **HTTPS**: If your application is running over HTTPS, make sure that the `secure` attribute in your `config/session.php` file is set to `true`.

## SMTP Connection Error

The error message you're seeing is related to the SSL version or encryption method used by the SMTP server. Here are a few things you could try:

1. **Change Encryption Method**: Try changing the `MAIL_ENCRYPTION` in your `.env` file from `ssl` to `tls`. Some servers use TLS instead of SSL.

2. **Change Port**: Try changing the `MAIL_PORT` in your `.env` file to `465` if you're using SSL or `587` if you're using TLS.

3. **Check with Hosting Provider**: If the above solutions don't work, it's possible that there's a server configuration issue. You might need to check with your hosting provider or the email service provider to find out the correct SMTP settings.

Remember to clear your config cache by running `php artisan config:cache` after making changes to your `.env` file.
