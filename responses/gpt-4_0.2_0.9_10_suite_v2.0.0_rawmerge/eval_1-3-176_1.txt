The error message indicates that the zlib library, which is a required dependency for Pillow, is not found on your system. 

However, the Pillow version you are trying to install (6.0.0) does not support Python 3.8 as mentioned in the warning message. 

```bash
C:\Users\rijal\AppData\Local\Temp\pip-install-di5is9gd\Pillow\setup.py:29: RuntimeWarning: Pillow does not yet support Python 3.8 and does not yet provide prebuilt Windows binaries. We do not recommend building from source on Windows.
```

You can solve this problem by upgrading Pillow to the latest version which supports Python 3.8. You can do this by running the following command:

```bash
pip install --upgrade pillow
```

If you still encounter the zlib error after upgrading Pillow, you may need to install the zlib development files on your system. On Windows, this can be a bit tricky, as there's no standard package manager you can use to install zlib. You might need to download zlib manually from its [official website](http://www.zlib.net/) and then compile it.

If you're not comfortable with manually compiling and installing libraries like zlib, an easier solution might be to install a Python distribution like [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution), which comes with zlib (and many other useful libraries) pre-installed.
