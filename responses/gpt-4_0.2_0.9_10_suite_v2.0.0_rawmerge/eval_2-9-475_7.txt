The error you're encountering is due to the missing `libffi` library on your macOS. You can install it using Homebrew. If you don't have Homebrew installed, you can install it first.

Here are the steps:

1. Install Homebrew:

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

2. Install `libffi`:

```bash
brew install libffi
```

3. After installing `libffi`, you need to set the `PKG_CONFIG_PATH` environment variable to the path where `libffi.pc` is located. This is usually in the `/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig/` directory. You can set this environment variable in your shell profile file (like `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`), or you can set it in your current shell session:

```bash
export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/usr/local/opt/libffi/lib/pkgconfig"
```

4. Now, you should be able to install `travis`:

```bash
gem install travis
```

Please try these steps and let me know if you still encounter any issues.
