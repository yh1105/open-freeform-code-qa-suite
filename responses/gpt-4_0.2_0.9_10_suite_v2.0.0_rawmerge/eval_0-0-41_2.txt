The issue with your code is that it only checks if the geolocation API is available in the browser, not whether the user has granted permission to access their location. The `getCurrentPosition` method is asynchronous and accepts a second argument, which is a function that will be called if an error occurs. You can use this to check if the user has denied permission:

```javascript
if (navigator.geolocation) {
    navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(
        position => {
            console.log("Location accessed");
        },
        error => {
            if (error.code === error.PERMISSION_DENIED)
                console.log("User not allowed");
        }
    );
} else {
    console.log("Geolocation is not supported by this browser.");
}
```

In this code, if the user denies permission, the error function will be called and "User not allowed" will be logged. If the geolocation API is not available at all, "Geolocation is not supported by this browser." will be logged.
