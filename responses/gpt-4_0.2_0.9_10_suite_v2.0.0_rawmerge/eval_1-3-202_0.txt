The error message you're seeing is due to the fact that the packages `requests` and `setuptools` are dependencies of `conda` itself, and `conda` is trying to remove or modify them during the environment creation process. This is not allowed, hence the error.

Here are a few things you can try to resolve this issue:

1. **Update Conda:** The issue might be due to an outdated version of `conda`. You can update `conda` using the following command:

    ```bash
    conda update conda
    ```

2. **Check the environment file:** The `python3.6-environment-windows.yml` file might have some specifications that are causing the issue. Check if `requests` and `setuptools` are being explicitly removed or downgraded in this file. If they are, you might need to modify the file.

3. **Create a new environment without the file:** Try creating a new environment without using the `python3.6-environment-windows.yml` file. If this works, then the issue is likely with the file itself.

    ```bash
    conda create --name myenv
    ```

4. **Reinstall Anaconda:** If none of the above solutions work, you might need to reinstall Anaconda. Uninstall it first, then download the latest version from the official Anaconda website and install it.

Remember to backup your environments and important data before reinstalling Anaconda.
