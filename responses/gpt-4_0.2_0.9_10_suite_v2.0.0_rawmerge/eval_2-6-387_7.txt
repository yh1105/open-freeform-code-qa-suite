The error message indicates that the SQLite database does not have a table named "Keys". This could be due to several reasons:

1. The database was not properly initialized.
2. The migrations were not applied.
3. The table was accidentally deleted.

Here are some steps you can take to solve this problem:

1. **Check your DbContext**: Ensure that your `AppDbContext` has a `DbSet` property for the `Keys` table.

```csharp
public DbSet<Key> Keys { get; set; }
```

2. **Create Migrations**: If you have not created a migration for the `Keys` table, you should do so. You can create a migration using the following command in the Package Manager Console:

```shell
Add-Migration AddKeysTable
```

3. **Update Database**: Apply the migration to the database using the following command:

```shell
Update-Database
```

4. **Check Database**: Check your SQLite database to ensure that the `Keys` table exists.

If you've followed these steps and are still experiencing the issue, it could be due to a problem with the connection string or the database file. Make sure the connection string in your appsettings.json file points to the correct SQLite database file and that the file exists.

If you're using IdentityServer4, the Keys table is used to store the keys for token signing. If you're using AddDeveloperSigningCredential or AddTestUser in your Startup.cs, it will create a temporary key for signing tokens. But if you want to persist the key between restarts, you need to configure IdentityServer to load the key from a store. You can use AddSigningCredential method to load the key from the store.
