You can use the `openpyxl` library in Python to write to an Excel file. If you don't have it installed, you can install it using pip:

```shell
pip install openpyxl
```

Here is the function `writeToExcel`:

```python
from openpyxl import Workbook

def writeExcel():
    new_list = [["first", "second"], ["third", "fourth"]]
    wb = Workbook()
    ws = wb.active

    for i in range(len(new_list)):
        for j in range(len(new_list[i])):
            ws.cell(row=i+1, column=j+1, value=new_list[i][j])

    wb.save("data.xlsx")
```

In this function, we first create a new Workbook and get the active worksheet. Then we iterate over the list of lists, and for each inner list, we write its elements to the Excel file. The `ws.cell` method is used to write a value to a specific cell, and `wb.save` is used to save the workbook to a file.
