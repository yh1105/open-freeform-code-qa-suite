The `[Keyless]` attribute is not part of the `System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations` namespace. It's actually part of the `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore` namespace.

You should have a reference to the `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore` in your project. If you don't have it, you can add it via NuGet package manager.

Here's how you can use it:

```csharp
using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore;

[Keyless]
public class MyKeylessClass
{
    public string SomeProperty { get; set; }
    // other properties...
}
```

Then in your `DbContext`:

```csharp
public DbSet<MyKeylessClass> KeylessModel { get; set; }
```

And you can use it as you mentioned:

```csharp
_context.KeylessModel.FromSqlRaw(...)
```

Remember, the `[Keyless]` attribute is used to specify that an entity type does not have any key, and it's only available from EF Core 3.0 and later.
