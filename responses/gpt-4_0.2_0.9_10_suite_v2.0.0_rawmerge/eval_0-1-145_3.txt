The `truncate` class in Tailwind CSS only works for single line text. If you want to truncate text that spans multiple lines, you will need to use some additional CSS.

Here's how you can do it:

```html
<div className="ml-1 inline-block">
   <span>Label: </span>
   <span className="font-semibold line-clamp-1">
     long texttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttt
   </span>
</div>
```

In the above code, `line-clamp-1` is a utility class provided by Tailwind CSS that will limit the text to 1 line and add an ellipsis (...) if the text overflows.

Please note that `line-clamp` is not fully supported in all browsers, so you should check the compatibility before using it. If you need to support a wide range of browsers, you may need to use a JavaScript solution instead.
