This error can be caused by a variety of issues, but here are a few common solutions that might help you:

1. **Clean the build folder**: You can do this by going to `Product > Clean Build Folder` or by pressing `Shift + Command + K`.

2. **Delete derived data**: Xcode stores build information in a derived data folder. Sometimes, this folder can contain outdated or corrupted information. You can delete this folder by going to `Xcode > Preferences > Locations > Derived Data > Delete`.

3. **Update CocoaPods**: Make sure you're using the latest version of CocoaPods. You can update CocoaPods by running `sudo gem install cocoapods` in the terminal.

4. **Update Pods**: You can update your pods by running `pod update` in the terminal in your project directory.

5. **Check your Swift version**: Make sure you're using a Swift version that's compatible with your Xcode version. You can check your Swift version by going to `Xcode > Preferences > Components > Swift Versions`.

6. **Reinstall Pods**: Sometimes, reinstalling your pods can fix the issue. You can do this by running `pod deintegrate` and then `pod install` in the terminal in your project directory.

If none of these solutions work, the issue might be with one of your pods. In this case, you might need to check the pod's documentation or contact the pod's author for help.
