The error message you're seeing is because Bootstrap requires `Popper.js` for the dropdowns and other interactive components. 

You can install it using npm or yarn:

**npm:**

```bash
npm install popper.js --save
```

**yarn:**

```bash
yarn add popper.js
```

After installing `Popper.js`, you need to import it into your project. If you're using ES6 modules, you can do it like this:

```javascript
import Popper from 'popper.js';
```

If you're using CommonJS modules, you can do it like this:

```javascript
const Popper = require('popper.js');
```

After this, your error should be resolved. If you're still seeing the error, make sure that the path to the `Popper.js` module is correct. If you installed it with npm or yarn, it should be in your `node_modules` folder.
