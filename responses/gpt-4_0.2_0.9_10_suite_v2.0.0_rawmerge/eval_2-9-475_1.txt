The error you're encountering is due to the missing `libffi` library in your macOS. You can install it using Homebrew. Here are the steps:

1. If you haven't installed Homebrew yet, install it by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

2. Once Homebrew is installed, you can install `libffi` by running:

```bash
brew install libffi
```

3. After the installation, you might need to update your `PKG_CONFIG_PATH` environment variable to include the path to `libffi.pc`. You can do this by adding the following lines to your shell profile file (like `.bashrc`, `.bash_profile`, or `.zshrc` depending on your shell):

```bash
export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/usr/local/opt/libffi/lib/pkgconfig"
```

4. Then, source your shell profile file. For example, if you're using bash and added the lines to `.bash_profile`, you'd run:

```bash
source ~/.bash_profile
```

5. Now, you should be able to install `travis`:

```bash
gem install travis
```

If you still encounter issues, it might be helpful to first update your Ruby environment or use a version manager like `rbenv` or `rvm`.
