You can use the `openpyxl` library in Python to write to an Excel file. Here is a function that does this:

```python
from openpyxl import Workbook

def writeExcel():
    new_list = [["first", "second"], ["third", "fourth"]]
    wb = Workbook()  # Create a new workbook
    ws = wb.active  # Get the active worksheet

    for i in range(len(new_list)):
        for j in range(len(new_list[i])):
            # Write to the worksheet at position (i+1, j+1)
            # (Excel indices start at 1, not 0)
            ws.cell(row=i+1, column=j+1, value=new_list[i][j])

    wb.save("data.xlsx")  # Save the workbook
```

This function creates a new Excel workbook, writes the contents of `new_list` to the first worksheet in the workbook, and then saves the workbook as "data.xlsx".

You can install the `openpyxl` library using pip:

```shell
pip install openpyxl
```
