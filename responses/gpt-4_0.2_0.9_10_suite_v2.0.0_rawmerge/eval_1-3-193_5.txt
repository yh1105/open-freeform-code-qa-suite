The error message you're seeing is because Selenium can't locate the Firefox binary on your system. This can happen if Firefox is not installed, or if it's installed in a non-standard location.

Here are a few ways to solve this problem:

1. **Install Firefox**: If Firefox is not installed on your system, you should install it. Selenium requires the browser to be installed on the system to automate it.

2. **Provide the path to Firefox binary**: If Firefox is installed but not in a standard location, you can tell Selenium where to find it. Here's how you can do it:

```python
from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.firefox.service import Service
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By
from selenium.webdriver.firefox.options import Options
from selenium.webdriver.common.keys import Keys
from selenium.webdriver.firefox.firefox_binary import FirefoxBinary

binary = FirefoxBinary('path/to/your/firefox/binary')
browser = webdriver.Firefox(firefox_binary=binary)
browser.get('http://www.seleniumhq.org')
```

Replace `'path/to/your/firefox/binary'` with the actual path to your Firefox binary.

3. **Use a different browser**: If you can't get Firefox to work, you could try using Chrome or another browser supported by Selenium. Here's an example of how to use Chrome:

```python
from selenium import webdriver

browser = webdriver.Chrome()
browser.get('http://www.seleniumhq.org')
```

For this to work, you'll need to have the ChromeDriver installed and available in your system's PATH.
