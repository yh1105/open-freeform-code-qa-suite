You can use the `merge` function in pandas to merge two data frames and then filter out the common rows. Here is a function that does that:

```python
import pandas as pd

def getDifference(df1, df2):
    # Merge the dataframes
    df = pd.merge(df1, df2, how='outer', indicator=True)

    # Filter out the rows that are only in df1
    df3 = df[df['_merge'] == 'left_only']

    # Drop the merge indicator column
    df3 = df3.drop(columns=['_merge'])

    return df3
```

This function works by merging `df1` and `df2` with an outer join, which includes all rows from both data frames. The `indicator=True` argument adds a column to the result that indicates whether each row comes from `df1` only, `df2` only, or both. Then, the function filters out the rows that come from `df1` only, and drops the indicator column.

Please note that this function assumes that `df1` and `df2` have the same columns. If they don't, you'll need to adjust the function to handle the differences.
