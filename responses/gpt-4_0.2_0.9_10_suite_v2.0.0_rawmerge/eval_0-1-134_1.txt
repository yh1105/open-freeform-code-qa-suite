It sounds like you're referring to a feature of code editors called "Emmet" which allows you to quickly generate HTML and CSS code using shortcuts. For example, typing `.classname` and then pressing `Tab` will automatically generate `<div class="classname"></div>`.

If this isn't working for you, it could be due to a few reasons:

1. Your code editor doesn't support Emmet. Most modern code editors like Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, and Atom support Emmet out of the box.

2. You're not in an HTML file. Emmet shortcuts usually only work when the file you're editing is recognized as an HTML file. Make sure your file has the `.html` extension.

3. Emmet is disabled. In some editors, Emmet can be turned off. Check your editor's settings to make sure Emmet is enabled.

4. You're not pressing `Tab` after typing the shortcut. After typing `.classname`, you need to press `Tab` to trigger the Emmet expansion.

If you're still having trouble, please provide more information about the code editor you're using and the exact steps you're taking.
