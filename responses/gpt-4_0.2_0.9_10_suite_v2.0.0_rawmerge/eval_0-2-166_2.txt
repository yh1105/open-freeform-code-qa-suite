Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom user interfaces. It doesn't provide a direct way to target child elements like you would do in CSS with `div.section > div`.

However, you can apply Tailwind CSS classes directly to the child `div` elements you want to style. Here's an example:

```html
<div class="section">
  <div class="bg-blue-500 text-white"> <!-- Tailwind CSS classes applied directly -->
    <!-- Content -->
  </div>
  <div class="p-4">
    <!-- Content -->
  </div>
</div>
```

In this example, the child `div` elements of the `div` with class `section` are styled with Tailwind CSS classes directly.

If you need to apply styles based on parent-child relationships, you might need to use traditional CSS or preprocessors like Sass, Less, or PostCSS along with Tailwind CSS.
