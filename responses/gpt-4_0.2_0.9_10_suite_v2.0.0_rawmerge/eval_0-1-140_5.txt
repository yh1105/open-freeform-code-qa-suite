Font Awesome 5 has a different way to use icons in CSS. It uses different font families for different types of icons. For example, `Font Awesome 5 Free` for solid icons, `Font Awesome 5 Brands` for brand icons, and `Font Awesome 5 Regular` for regular icons.

The unicode for the angle down icon in Font Awesome 5 is `f107`, which is the same as in Font Awesome 4. However, in Font Awesome 5, this unicode refers to a solid icon, so you need to use the `Font Awesome 5 Free` font family and specify the font weight for solid icons, which is `900`.

Here is how you can modify your CSS code:

```css
#mainNav .navbar-collapse .navbar-sidenav .nav-link-collapse:after {
  float: right;
  content: "\f107";
  font-family: "Font Awesome 5 Free";
  font-weight: 900;
}
```

Remember to include the Font Awesome 5 CSS in your HTML:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://use.fontawesome.com/releases/v5.0.13/css/all.css">
```

Also, make sure that the specific icon you are trying to use is available in the version of Font Awesome that you are using.
