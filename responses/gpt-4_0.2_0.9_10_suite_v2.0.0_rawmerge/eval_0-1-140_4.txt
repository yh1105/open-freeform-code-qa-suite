Font Awesome 5 has made some changes in the way it is used compared to Font Awesome 4. The `font-family` is now separated into three different families: `Font Awesome 5 Free`, `Font Awesome 5 Brands`, and `Font Awesome 5 Pro`. The `content` values have also changed for some icons.

The `fa-chevron-down` (which corresponds to the unicode `f107`) is now in the `Font Awesome 5 Free` family, and its unicode has changed to `f078`.

Here is how you can update your CSS:

```css
#mainNav .navbar-collapse .navbar-sidenav .nav-link-collapse:after {
  float: right;
  content: "\f078";
  font-family: "Font Awesome 5 Free";
  font-weight: 900;
}
```

The `font-weight: 900;` is required for solid icons in Font Awesome 5. If you want to use regular icons, you should use `font-weight: 400;` and for light icons, use `font-weight: 300;`.
