Here is the function `getASCIIAsString` in Go:

```go
func getASCIIAsString(asciiCode byte) string {
    return string(asciiCode)
}
```

This function takes a byte (which is equivalent to uint8 in Go) as an argument and converts it to a string using the built-in `string` function. The byte is interpreted as an ASCII code, and the corresponding character is returned as a string.
