Sure, I can help with that. The URL you are using is a Google Drive URL for viewing the file in a web browser, not for downloading the file. To download a file from Google Drive, the URL should be in the format `https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=FILE_ID`. 

Here is the function `processURL` that takes a Google Drive URL and returns the direct download link:

```python
def processURL(url):
    file_id = url.split('/')[-2]
    dwn_url='https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=' + file_id
    return dwn_url
```

You can use this function to process the URL and then read the CSV file with pandas:

```python
import pandas as pd

url = 'https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B6GhBwm5vaB2ekdlZW5WZnppb28/view?usp=sharing'
url = processURL(url)
dfs = pd.read_csv(url)
```

Please note that this will only work if the file is publicly accessible. If the file is private, you will need to use the Google Drive API and authenticate before you can download the file.
