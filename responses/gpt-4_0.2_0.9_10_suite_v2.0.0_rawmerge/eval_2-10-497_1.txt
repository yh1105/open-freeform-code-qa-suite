In Rust, `Box<T>` is a smart pointer type, and it is guaranteed to be non-null. If you want to have an optional `Box<T>`, you can use `Option<Box<T>>`. When the `Option` is `None`, it represents a null or absent value. 

Here is how you can modify your code:

```rust
struct Node {
    value: i32,
    next: Option<Box<Node>>,
}

struct Stack {
    top: Option<Box<Node>>,
}
```

You can check if the `Box<Node>` is null by checking if the `Option<Box<Node>>` is `None`:

```rust
if let Some(node) = &stack.top {
    // The Box<Node> is not null, and `node` is a reference to the Box<Node>.
} else {
    // The Box<Node> is null.
}
```

Or using `is_none()` and `is_some()` methods:

```rust
if stack.top.is_some() {
    // The Box<Node> is not null.
} else if stack.top.is_none() {
    // The Box<Node> is null.
}
```

This is a more idiomatic way to handle null or absent values in Rust, and it has the benefit of being checked at compile time, so you can't accidentally dereference a null pointer.
