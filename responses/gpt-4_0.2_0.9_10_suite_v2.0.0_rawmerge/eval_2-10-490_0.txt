Yes, there is a better way to handle this in Rust. You can use the `?` operator to make your code cleaner and more readable. The `?` operator is used for error propagation. When used in a function that returns `Result` or `Option`, it will return early if the function it is called on returns an `Err` or `None`.

Here's how you can refactor your code:

```rust
fn main() {
    match func() {
        Some(result) => {
            // Do something with result
        }
        None => println!("A function returned None"),
    }
}

fn func() -> Option<i32> {
    let i = func1()?;
    let j = func2(i)?;
    let k = func3(j)?;
    let result = func4(k)?;
    Some(result)
}

fn func1() -> Option<i32> {
    // Your code here
    None
}

fn func2(i: i32) -> Option<i32> {
    // Your code here
    None
}

fn func3(j: i32) -> Option<i32> {
    // Your code here
    None
}

fn func4(k: i32) -> Option<i32> {
    // Your code here
    None
}
```
In this refactored code, each function call is on its own line, and the error handling is done by the `?` operator. If any function returns `None`, the `func` function will immediately return `None`, and the error message will be printed in the `main` function.

Please note that the `?` operator can only be used in functions that return `Result` or `Option`. In this case, we've created a new function `func` that calls `func1`, `func2`, `func3`, and `func4` and returns an `Option`. This allows us to use the `?` operator to handle the `None` cases.
