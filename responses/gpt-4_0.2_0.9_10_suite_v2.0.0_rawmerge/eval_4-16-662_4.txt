You can use `jq` command-line JSON processor to minify JSON in a shell script. `jq` is a lightweight and flexible command-line JSON processor. If it's not installed, you can install it using package managers like `apt` for Ubuntu, `brew` for MacOS, etc.

Here is how you can use `jq` to minify JSON:

```bash
echo '{
    "foo": "lorem",
    "bar": "ipsum"
}' | jq -c .
```

This will output:

```bash
{"foo":"lorem","bar":"ipsum"}
```

In the above command, `jq -c .` minifies the JSON. `-c` or `--compact-output` option ensures that each JSON object is output on a single line.

If you have a JSON file, you can use `jq` in the following way:

```bash
jq -c . file.json
```

This will output the minified JSON to the console. If you want to overwrite the original file with the minified JSON, you can use the following command:

```bash
jq -c . file.json > tmp.json && mv tmp.json file.json
```

This command will create a temporary file `tmp.json` with the minified JSON and then replace the original file with it.
