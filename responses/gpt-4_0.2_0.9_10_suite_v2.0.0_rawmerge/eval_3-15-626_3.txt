Your code seems to be on the right track, but there are a few issues that need to be addressed:

1. You are trying to use `query` and `currentSheet` as variables, but you haven't declared them. In VBA, you should declare your variables using `Dim` keyword.

2. You are trying to assign a sheet name to `currentSheet` variable, but you are not using it anywhere in your code.

3. You are trying to use `query` as a `WorkbookQuery` object, but you are assigning a cell value to it. 

4. You are trying to use `query.Name` in your connection string, but `query` is not an object, it's a cell value.

Here's a revised version of your code:

```vba
Sub LoadToWorksheetOnly()

    Dim query As String
    Dim currentSheet As Worksheet
    Dim destinationSheet As Worksheet

    ' Assign the query from a cell in Sheet6
    query = Sheets("Sheet6").Range("A1").Value

    ' Assign the current active sheet to currentSheet
    Set currentSheet = ActiveSheet

    ' Assign the destination sheet
    Set destinationSheet = ThisWorkbook.Sheets("target")

    ' Create a ListObject with a Query Table
    With destinationSheet.ListObjects.Add(SourceType:=0, Source:= _
        "OLEDB;Provider=Microsoft.Mashup.OleDb.1;Data Source=$Workbook$;Location=" & query _
        , Destination:=destinationSheet.Range("$A$1")).QueryTable
        .CommandType = xlCmdDefault
        .CommandText = Array("SELECT * FROM [" & query & "]")
        .RowNumbers = False
        .FillAdjacentFormulas = False
        .PreserveFormatting = True
        .RefreshOnFileOpen = False
        .BackgroundQuery = True
        .RefreshStyle = xlInsertDeleteCells
        .SavePassword = False
        .SaveData = True
        .AdjustColumnWidth = True
        .RefreshPeriod = 0
        .PreserveColumnInfo = False
        .Refresh BackgroundQuery:=False
    End With

End Sub
```

This code assumes that you have a valid Power Query in cell A1 of Sheet6 and you want to load the result of this query to the "target" sheet. Please adjust the sheet names and cell references according to your needs.
