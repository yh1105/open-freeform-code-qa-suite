In R, when you bind two data frames with the same column names using `cbind()`, it actually modifies the column names to make them unique. The column names of the resulting data frame are made unique by appending a number to the duplicate column names. So, in your case, the column names of `d3` would be `a` and `a.1`.

You can select the second column by its name `a.1` as follows:

```r
second_col <- d3$a.1
```

However, if for some reason the column names are not made unique and you still have two columns with the same name, you can select the second column by its index:

```r
second_col <- d3[,2]
```

This will select the second column regardless of its name.
