The `Get-Service` cmdlet in PowerShell does not provide a way to get the detailed description of a service. However, you can use the `Get-WmiObject` cmdlet to get the detailed description of a service.

Here's an example:

```powershell
Get-WmiObject -Query "Select * From Win32_Service" | Select-Object DisplayName, Description | Out-GridView
```

This command uses `Get-WmiObject` to query the `Win32_Service` WMI class, which contains information about all services on the system. It then pipes the results to `Select-Object` to select the `DisplayName` and `Description` properties, and finally pipes the results to `Out-GridView` to display them in a grid view.

Please note that the `Description` field in the `Win32_Service` WMI class may not always be populated, depending on the service.
