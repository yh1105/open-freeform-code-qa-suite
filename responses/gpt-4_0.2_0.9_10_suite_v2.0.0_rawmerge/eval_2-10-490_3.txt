Yes, there is a better way to handle this in Rust. You can use the `?` operator to propagate the `None` value up the call stack. This operator is used after a function that returns a `Result` or `Option`. If the function returns an `Err` or `None`, the `?` operator will return early from the function and give the `Err` or `None` value. If the function returns an `Ok` or `Some`, the `?` operator will extract the value inside the `Ok` or `Some` for use in the next line of the function.

However, the `?` operator can only be used in functions that return a `Result` or `Option`. In your case, you can use the `?` operator in a new function that calls `func1`, `func2`, `func3`, and `func4`.

Here's how you can refactor your code:

```rust
fn call_functions() -> Option<()> {
    let i = func1()?;
    let j = func2(i)?;
    let k = func3(j)?;
    let result = func4(k)?;

    // Do something with result

    Some(())
}

match call_functions() {
    Some(_) => println!("All functions returned Some"),
    None => println!("One of the functions returned None"),
}
```

In this refactored code, if any of the functions return `None`, the `call_functions` function will immediately return `None` and the `match` statement will print "One of the functions returned None". If all of the functions return `Some`, the `match` statement will print "All functions returned Some".
