Yes, you can prevent the generation of the `*.plain.jar` file in Spring Boot 2.5.0 with Gradle by disabling the `bootJar` task in your `build.gradle` file. 

You can do this by adding the following lines to your `build.gradle`:

```groovy
bootJar {
    enabled = false
}
```

This will disable the `bootJar` task, which is responsible for creating the `*.plain.jar` file. Now, only the `*.jar` file will be generated during the build.
