Source maps are files that associate the compiled JavaScript that runs in the browser back to the original TypeScript source code. They are a critical tool for debugging because they allow you to see your original TypeScript (or other language that compiles to JavaScript) in the developer tools of your browser.

When `"sourceMap": true` is set in your `tsconfig.json`, it tells the TypeScript compiler to generate source maps for your TypeScript files. This means that when you debug your application in the browser, you can see and step through the original TypeScript code.

If you set `"sourceMap": false`, the TypeScript compiler will not generate these source map files. This means that when you debug your application in the browser, you will only see and be able to step through the compiled JavaScript code, not the original TypeScript.

The reason you might not see any difference in your app when you change this setting is because source maps don't affect the runtime behavior of your app. They only affect the debugging experience. So, you would only notice a difference if you were debugging your app in the browser.
