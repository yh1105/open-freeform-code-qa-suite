You can achieve this by using the `-split` operator in PowerShell. This operator splits a string into substrings based on the characters in an array. You can specify multiple delimiters for splitting the string.

Here is how you can modify your script:

```powershell
$FileArray = @("Name1-354-03.pdf", "Name23-354-H11.pdf", "Name354-354-02.pdf", "Name3545-354.pdf")
ForEach ($n in $FileArray){
     $split = $n -split '-354'
     Write-Host ($split[0] + "-354")
}
```

In this script, `-split '-354'` splits the string into substrings at '-354'. The first part of the split string is accessed by `$split[0]`, and then "-354" is appended back to it.

This will give you the desired output:

```
Name1-354
Name23-354
Name354-354
Name3545-354
```

Please note that this will only work correctly if "-354" appears only once in the filename. If "-354" can appear more than once and you want to cut off everything after the last occurrence, you would need a different approach.
