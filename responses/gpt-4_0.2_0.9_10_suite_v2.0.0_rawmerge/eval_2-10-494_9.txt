The error message you're seeing is coming from rust-analyzer, which is a language server protocol implementation for Rust. It's not an error from the Rust compiler itself. The error message "could not resolve macro `$crate::format_args`" suggests that rust-analyzer is having trouble resolving the `format_args!` macro, which is used internally by macros like `println!`, `format!`, and `assert_eq!`.

This error might be due to a bug in rust-analyzer or a problem with its configuration. Here are a few things you can try to resolve this issue:

1. **Update rust-analyzer**: If you're using an old version of rust-analyzer, updating to the latest version might resolve the issue. You can update rust-analyzer through your editor's extension or plugin manager.

2. **Check your rust-analyzer configuration**: Make sure that rust-analyzer is correctly configured to use the Rust toolchain you're using. If you're using rustup, for example, rust-analyzer should be configured to use the same toolchain that rustup is using.

3. **Disable and re-enable rust-analyzer**: Sometimes, simply disabling and re-enabling rust-analyzer can resolve issues like this. You can do this through your editor's extension or plugin manager.

4. **Check for known issues**: This might be a known issue with rust-analyzer. Check the rust-analyzer GitHub repository for open issues that might be related to your problem.

Remember, this is not a compile error or a problem with your code. Your code is correct and should work as expected. The error you're seeing is a problem with the tool you're using to analyze your code, not with the code itself.
