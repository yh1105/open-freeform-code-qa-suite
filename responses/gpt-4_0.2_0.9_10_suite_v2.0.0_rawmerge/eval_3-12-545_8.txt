The error you're seeing is because you're trying to send a JSON body with the `http.post` method, but you're passing the body as a Dart `Map`. The `http.post` method doesn't automatically encode the body as JSON, you need to do that manually.

Here's how you can fix it:

```dart
import 'dart:convert';

Map<String,String> headers = {
  'Content-Type':'application/json',
  'authorization':'Basic c3R1ZHlkb3RlOnN0dWR5ZG90ZTEyMw=='
};

Map<String, dynamic> body = {
  "grant_type":"password",
  "username":"******",
  "password":"*****",
  "scope":"offline_access"
};

var response = await post(
  Urls.getToken,
  headers: headers,
  body: json.encode(body),  // Encode body to JSON
);
```

In this code, we're using the `dart:convert` library's `json.encode` function to convert the Dart `Map` to a JSON string before sending it in the HTTP request.
