The issue you're facing is due to the single quotes around `$searchT` in your `grep` command. In bash, single quotes preserve the literal value of all characters within the quotes, meaning that your variable `$searchT` is not being expanded to its value.

You should use double quotes instead, which will allow for variable expansion. Here's the corrected script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
read -p "enter search term here: " searchT

if [[ $(cat test.txt | grep -wi "$searchT") ]]; then     
    echo "$(cat test.txt | grep "$searchT" | wc -l) number of matches found"
    echo $(cat test.txt | grep "$searchT")

else 
    echo "no match found"    

fi

exit 0
```

Also, note that I moved the `| wc -l` command to only count the lines from the `grep` command, not from the `cat` command. This will give you the correct number of matches.
