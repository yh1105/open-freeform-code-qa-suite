You can achieve this by simply removing the space character from your replacement string. In your case, you are replacing the special characters with a space (" "). If you want to remove the special characters without leaving a space, you should replace them with an empty string ("").

Here is your modified code:

```vba
Sub ReplaceSpecial()
    Dim cel As Range
    Dim strVal As String
    Dim i As Long
    Application.ScreenUpdating = False
    For Each cel In Selection
        strVal = cel.Value
        For i = 1 To Len(strVal)
            Select Case Asc(Mid(strVal, i, 1))
                Case 32, 48 To 57, 65 To 90, 97 To 122
                    ' Leave ordinary characters alone
                Case Else
                    Mid(strVal, i, 1) = "" ' Replace with empty string instead of space
            End Select
        Next i
        cel.Value = strVal
    Next cel
    Application.ScreenUpdating = True
End Sub
```

This will replace all special characters with nothing, effectively removing them from your string.
