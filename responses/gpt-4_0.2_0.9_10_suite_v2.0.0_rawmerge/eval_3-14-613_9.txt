This issue might be due to the SwiftUI preview not being associated with a target. Here's how to fix it:

1. Open your SwiftUI file.
2. Click on the file inspector (the first icon on the right panel).
3. Under "Target Membership", make sure your app's target is checked.

If the target is already checked, try the following:

1. Clean your build folder (Product -> Clean Build Folder).
2. Quit Xcode.
3. Delete derived data folder (`~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData`).
4. Restart your Mac.
5. Open your project and try again.

If none of the above works, it might be a bug in Xcode 12.3. You can try updating to a newer version of Xcode or downgrading to an older stable version.
