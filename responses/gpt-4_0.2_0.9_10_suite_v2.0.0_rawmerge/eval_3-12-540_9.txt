Yes, Flutter provides a widget called `VerticalDivider` to draw vertical lines between components. 

Here is a simple example of how to use it:

```dart
Row(
  children: <Widget>[
    Expanded(
      child: Text('Item 1'),
    ),
    const VerticalDivider(
      color: Colors.grey,
      thickness: 1,
      width: 20,
    ),
    Expanded(
      child: Text('Item 2'),
    ),
  ],
)
```

In this example, a vertical line is drawn between two text widgets. The `VerticalDivider` widget has properties to customize the color, thickness, and width of the line.

Remember to import the material.dart package at the top of your file to use `VerticalDivider`:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
```

Also, note that `VerticalDivider` is only visible when used in a `Row` widget or inside a widget with horizontal flow.
