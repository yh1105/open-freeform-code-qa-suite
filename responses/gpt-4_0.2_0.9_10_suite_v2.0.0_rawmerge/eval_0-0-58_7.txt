The `EINTEGRITY` error is caused by a failed data integrity check. This can happen if your package's dependencies have changed, or if a package's files have changed since the last time you installed it.

Here are some steps you can take to resolve this issue:

1. **Clear the npm cache:** You can do this by running the command `npm cache clean --force`. This will remove all data from your npm cache folder.

2. **Delete the `node_modules` folder:** This is the folder where npm installs your project's dependencies. Deleting it will allow npm to install fresh copies of your dependencies. You can delete it by running the command `rm -rf node_modules`.

3. **Delete the `package-lock.json` file:** This file is automatically generated for any operations where npm modifies either the `node_modules` tree, or `package.json`. It describes the exact tree that was generated, such that subsequent installs are able to generate identical trees, regardless of intermediate dependency updates. You can delete it by running the command `rm package-lock.json`.

4. **Reinstall your dependencies:** After you've cleared the npm cache, deleted the `node_modules` folder, and deleted the `package-lock.json` file, you can reinstall your dependencies by running the command `npm install`.

If you're still experiencing the issue after following these steps, it's possible that there's an issue with the npm registry itself, or with the package you're trying to install. In this case, you might want to reach out to the package maintainer for help.
