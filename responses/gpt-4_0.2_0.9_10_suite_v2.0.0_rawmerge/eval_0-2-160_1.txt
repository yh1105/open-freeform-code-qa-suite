Source maps are files that associate the compiled JavaScript that runs in the browser back to the original TypeScript source code. They are used for debugging purposes.

When `"sourceMap": true` is set in `tsconfig.json`, the TypeScript compiler generates corresponding `.map` files for each compiled `.js` file. These `.map` files are source maps that map the JavaScript code back to the original TypeScript code. This allows you to debug your application in the browser using the original TypeScript code, even though the browser is actually running the compiled JavaScript code.

When you set `"sourceMap": false`, the TypeScript compiler will not generate these `.map` files. This means you won't be able to debug your TypeScript code directly in the browser. Instead, you'll have to debug the compiled JavaScript code.

In terms of the running application, there won't be any noticeable difference whether source maps are enabled or not. The application will still work the same. The difference is only noticeable when you're debugging the code.

Keep in mind that source maps can increase the size of your deployed application, so it's common to disable them in production builds.
