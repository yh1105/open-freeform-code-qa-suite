Here is a Python function that does what you want:

```python
def ReplaceElementsByIndex(rest, b, last):
    # Create a dictionary where keys are elements from b and values are elements from rest
    replace_dict = dict(zip(b[:len(rest)], rest))
    
    # Replace elements in last according to the dictionary
    last = [replace_dict.get(i, i) for i in last]
    
    return last
```

This function works by creating a dictionary where the keys are the elements from `b` that you want to replace, and the values are the elements from `rest` that you want to replace them with. Then it goes through the `last` list and replaces each element with its corresponding value in the dictionary, if it exists. If it doesn't exist in the dictionary (i.e., it's not one of the elements you want to replace), it just leaves it as is.

Here is how you can use this function:

```python
rest=[5, 7, 11, 4]
b=[21, 22, 33, 31, 23, 15, 19, 13, 6]
last=[33, 19, 40, 21, 31, 22, 6, 15, 13, 23]

print(ReplaceElementsByIndex(rest, b, last))
```

This will output:

```python
[11, 19, 40, 5, 4, 7, 6, 15, 13, 23]
```
