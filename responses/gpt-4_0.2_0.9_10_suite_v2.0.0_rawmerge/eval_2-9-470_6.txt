The error message is indicating that the ffi gem is trying to load `libffi.so.6`, but it can't find it. This is likely because the upgrade to your OS included an upgrade to libffi, and the newer version of libffi is not backwards-compatible with the version that the ffi gem was built against.

Here's how you can fix this issue:

1. Uninstall the ffi gem:

```bash
gem uninstall ffi
```

2. Reinstall the ffi gem:

```bash
gem install ffi
```

This will build the ffi gem against the version of libffi that is currently installed on your system.

If you're using bundler and you get an error about the ffi version being locked, you can update just the ffi gem with bundler:

```bash
bundle update ffi
```

If the problem persists, you might need to install the libffi-dev package:

```bash
sudo apt-get install libffi-dev
```

And then try to reinstall the ffi gem.
