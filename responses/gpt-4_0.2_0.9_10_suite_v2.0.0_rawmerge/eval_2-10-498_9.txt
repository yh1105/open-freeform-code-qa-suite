In Rust, the caret (`^`) operator is not used for exponentiation. Instead, it is used for bitwise XOR operation. 

To raise a number to a power in Rust, you can use the `pow` method. Here is an example:

```rust
fn main() {
    let base = 2;
    let exponent = 3;
    let result = base.pow(exponent);
    println!("{} raised to the power of {} is {}", base, exponent, result);
}
```

In this example, `2` is raised to the power of `3`, and the result is `8`.

The `pow` method works on integers and returns the result of raising the number to the power of the input value. It's important to note that the exponent must be of type `u32`.
