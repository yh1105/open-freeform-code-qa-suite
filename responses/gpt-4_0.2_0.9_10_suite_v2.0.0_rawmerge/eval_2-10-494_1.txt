The error message "could not resolve macro `$crate::format_args`" is coming from the Rust Analyzer, a language server that provides IDE features for the Rust programming language. This error message means that the Rust Analyzer is having trouble understanding the macro `format_args!` which is used internally by the `assert_eq!` macro in your test.

This is likely not an issue with your code, but rather an issue with the Rust Analyzer itself. Rust Analyzer sometimes has trouble with macros, especially in more complex scenarios.

Here are a few things you can try to resolve this issue:

1. **Update Rust Analyzer**: If you're using an older version of Rust Analyzer, updating to the latest version might fix the problem. You can update Rust Analyzer through your editor's extension or plugin management interface.

2. **Restart your editor**: Sometimes, simply restarting your editor can resolve issues with Rust Analyzer.

3. **Check your Rust toolchain**: Make sure you're using a recent stable version of the Rust toolchain. You can update your toolchain with `rustup update`.

4. **Ignore the error**: If the error is not affecting your ability to write or test your code, you can choose to ignore it. Rust Analyzer's error messages do not always indicate actual problems with your code.

Remember, as long as `cargo build`, `cargo check`, and `cargo test` are working correctly, your code is likely fine. Rust Analyzer is a tool to help with development, but it's not always perfect.
