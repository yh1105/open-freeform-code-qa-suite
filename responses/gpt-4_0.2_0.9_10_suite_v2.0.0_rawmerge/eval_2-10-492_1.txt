Sure, here is the code snippet with the blanks filled:

```rust
    let ix = anchor_lang::solana_program::system_instruction::transfer(
        &user_account.key(),
        &event_vault_address,
        amount,
    );
    anchor_lang::solana_program::program::invoke(
        &ix,
        &[
            user_account.clone(),
            ctx.accounts.system_program.clone(),
        ],
    );
```

In this code:

- `user_account.key()` is the public key of the user's account from which SOL will be transferred.
- `event_vault_address` is the public key of the event account's vault address where SOL will be deposited.
- `amount` is the amount of SOL to be transferred.
- `user_account.clone()` and `ctx.accounts.system_program.clone()` are the account references needed for the invoke function. The user account is needed because it is the source of the funds, and the system program account is needed because it is the program that performs the transfer.
