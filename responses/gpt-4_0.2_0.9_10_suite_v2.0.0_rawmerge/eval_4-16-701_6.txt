You can use the following function in PowerShell to check if a specified folder is in your PATH:

```powershell
function FolderIsInPATH($Path_to_directory) {
    $path = [Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable("PATH")
    $paths = $path -split ";"
    return $paths -contains $Path_to_directory
}
```

This function splits the PATH environment variable into an array of paths and checks if the specified directory is in that array. It returns true if the directory is in the PATH, and false otherwise.
