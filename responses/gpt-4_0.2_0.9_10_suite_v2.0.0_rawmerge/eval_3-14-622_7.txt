To conform to `ShapeStyle` protocol, you need to implement the `func _apply(to shape: inout _ShapeStyle_ShapeType)` method. Here's how you can do it:

```swift
struct MyContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        Circle()
            .fill(RedShapeStyle())
    }
}

struct RedShapeStyle: ShapeStyle {
    func _apply(to shape: inout _ShapeStyle_ShapeType) {
        shape.fill = Color.red._apply(to:)
    }
}
```

However, please note that `_ShapeStyle_ShapeType` and `_apply(to:)` are private APIs, which means they are not intended for public use and may change or be removed in future versions of SwiftUI. 

As a result, it's generally not recommended to conform to `ShapeStyle` directly. Instead, you should use one of the existing types that conform to `ShapeStyle`, such as `Color`, `Gradient`, `AngularGradient`, or `RadialGradient`, or create a new type that combines these existing types.
