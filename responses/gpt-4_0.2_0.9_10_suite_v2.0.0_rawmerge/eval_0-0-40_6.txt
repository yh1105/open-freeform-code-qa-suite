The error message you're seeing is because WSL2 is trying to use the Windows version of npm, which is not compatible with WSL2. 

You can solve this issue by adding the following lines to your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc` file:

```bash
export PATH="/usr/bin:$PATH"
```

This line will prioritize the WSL2 versions of node and npm over the Windows versions.

After adding this line, you need to source your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc` file to apply the changes:

```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```

or 

```bash
source ~/.zshrc
```

Now, when you run `npm -v`, you should see the version of npm installed on your WSL2 Ubuntu 20.04, not the Windows version. 

If you still face the same issue, you might need to reinstall `nodejs` and `npm`:

```bash
sudo apt-get purge nodejs npm
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_14.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
```

This will remove the current installation of `nodejs` and `npm`, and then install the latest LTS version of `nodejs`, which includes `npm`. 

Remember to replace `14.x` with the version of Node.js you want to install.
