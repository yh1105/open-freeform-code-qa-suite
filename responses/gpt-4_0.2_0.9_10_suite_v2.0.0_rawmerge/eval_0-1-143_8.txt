Yes, you can modify the userChrome.css file to customize the appearance of Firefox's user interface, including the spacing between menu items. Here's how you can do it:

1. First, you need to enable the ability to use this file. Type `about:config` in the Firefox address bar and press Enter. Accept the risk and continue, then in the search bar type `toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets` and set its value to `true` by clicking on the toggle button.

2. Now, you need to locate your Firefox profile folder. Type `about:support` in the Firefox address bar and press Enter. In the `Application Basics` section, click on `Open Directory` next to `Profile Directory`. This will open your profile directory in your file explorer.

3. In your profile directory, create a new folder named `chrome` if it doesn't exist already.

4. Inside the `chrome` folder, create a new file named `userChrome.css`. If the file already exists, open it.

5. Paste the following CSS into the `userChrome.css` file:

```css
/* Reduce Menu and Contextual Menu Height */
:root {
  --arrowpanel-menuitem-padding: 4px 8px !important;
}

menupopup > menuitem, menupopup > menu {
  padding-block: var(--arrowpanel-menuitem-padding) !important;
}
```

6. Save the `userChrome.css` file and restart Firefox.

This CSS reduces the padding around menu items, effectively reducing the spacing between them. You can adjust the `4px 8px` values to your liking. The first value is the vertical padding (top and bottom) and the second value is the horizontal padding (left and right).

Remember to restart Firefox every time you make changes to the `userChrome.css` file for the changes to take effect.
