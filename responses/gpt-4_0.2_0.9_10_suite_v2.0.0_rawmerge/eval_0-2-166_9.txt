Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that doesn't provide a direct way to target child elements like you would do in traditional CSS. It doesn't support selectors like `>` or `+`.

However, you can use Tailwind CSS with traditional CSS. If you need to style direct children of a specific div, you can still use traditional CSS in your stylesheets.

For example:

```css
div.section > div {
  @apply bg-red-500; /* Tailwind utility classes */
}
```

In this example, `@apply` directive is used to apply Tailwind utility classes within a CSS rule-set.

Remember to configure your `tailwind.config.js` to enable this feature:

```js
module.exports = {
  purge: [],
  darkMode: false,
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  variants: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [
    require('@tailwindcss/forms'),
  ],
}
```

This is a workaround as Tailwind CSS is not designed to handle child or sibling selectors directly. It's more about applying utility classes directly to the HTML elements.
