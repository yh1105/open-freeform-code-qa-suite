The error you're encountering is because you're trying to use `std::filesystem` but you've included `<experimental/filesystem>`. In C++17, the filesystem library was still experimental and was under `std::experimental::filesystem`, not `std::filesystem`.

Here's how you can fix your code:

```c++
#include <experimental/filesystem>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

namespace fs = std::experimental::filesystem;

int main(int argc, char** argv)
{
    std::string imageDirectory = "./image";
    std::vector<std::string> imagePath;
    for (const auto& entry: fs::directory_iterator(imageDirectory))
    {
        imagePath.push_back(entry.path());
        std::cout << entry.path() << std::endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
```

In this code, I've created a namespace alias `fs` for `std::experimental::filesystem` to make the code easier to read and write. Then, I've replaced `std::filesystem` with `fs`.

If you're using a C++17 or later compiler and want to use `std::filesystem`, you should include `<filesystem>` instead of `<experimental/filesystem>`. However, note that not all compilers fully support `<filesystem>` in C++17. For example, GCC didn't fully support `<filesystem>` until version 8.1. If you're using an older compiler, you may need to stick with `<experimental/filesystem>`.
