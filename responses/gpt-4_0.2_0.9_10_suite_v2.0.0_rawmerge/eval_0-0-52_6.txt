Angular CLI doesn't provide a specific command to remove a package. However, you can remove a package manually by following these steps:

1. Open the `package.json` file in your project.

2. Find the package you want to remove in the `dependencies` or `devDependencies` section.

3. Remove the line that includes the package.

4. Save the `package.json` file.

5. Run `npm install` in your terminal to update your `node_modules` folder and `package-lock.json`.

Alternatively, you can use npm or yarn to remove the package:

- If you are using npm, run `npm uninstall <package>`.

- If you are using yarn, run `yarn remove <package>`.

Both commands will remove the package from `node_modules` and `package.json`.
