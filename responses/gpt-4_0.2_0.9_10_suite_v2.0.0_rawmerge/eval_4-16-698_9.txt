You can use the `source` command to reload your `.bash_profile` without closing and reopening your terminal. Here's how:

```bash
source ~/.bash_profile
```

This command reads and executes the `.bash_profile` file in the current shell. The `~` is a shortcut for your home directory.

If you've made changes to other configuration files, you can use the `source` command in the same way. Just replace `~/.bash_profile` with the path to the file you want to reload.

Remember, this doesn't technically "restart" your terminal session, but it does apply any new changes you've made to your `.bash_profile`.
