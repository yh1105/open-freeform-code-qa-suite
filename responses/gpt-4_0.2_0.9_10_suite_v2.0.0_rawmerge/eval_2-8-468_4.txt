Sure, here is a simple function in Go that converts an ASCII code to a string:

```go
func getASCIIAsString(asciiCode byte) string {
    return string(asciiCode)
}
```

This function takes a byte (which is an 8-bit integer in Go, and therefore can represent an ASCII code) and uses the built-in `string` function to convert it to a string. The resulting string is the character that corresponds to the ASCII code.
