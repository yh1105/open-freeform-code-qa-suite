The error you're encountering could be due to a number of reasons. Here are a few things you could try:

1. **Check SeleniumBasic and Browser Driver Version**: Make sure you have the latest version of SeleniumBasic installed. Also, ensure that the browser driver (e.g., ChromeDriver for Google Chrome) is compatible with the version of the browser you're using.

2. **Check Excel References**: Go to VBA Editor > Tools > References and make sure that Selenium Type Library is checked. If it's missing, you might need to browse for SeleniumBasic.tlb file which is usually located in the SeleniumBasic installation folder.

3. **Check Internet Explorer Settings**: Since you're using Internet Explorer in your code, make sure that the version of Internet Explorer installed on your machine is compatible with the SeleniumBasic version you're using. Also, check the Internet Explorer settings and make sure that the "Enable Protected Mode" setting is the same for all zones.

4. **Try Using a Different Browser**: If the issue persists, try using a different browser. For example, if you have Google Chrome installed, you could try using ChromeDriver instead of Internet Explorer.

Here's an example of how you could modify your code to use Google Chrome:

```vba
Dim driver As New WebDriver
Dim keyObj As Selenium.keys

Set keyObj = New Selenium.keys

driver.Start "chrome", "https://www.google.com/"
driver.Window.Maximize
```

5. **Check for Updates**: Make sure that your Excel 2019 is up-to-date. Microsoft often releases updates that fix various issues, so it's possible that updating Excel could resolve the issue.

If none of these suggestions work, please provide the exact error message you're receiving for further assistance.
