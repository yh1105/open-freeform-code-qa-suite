The `truncate` class in Tailwind CSS only works for single line text. It sets `overflow: hidden`, `text-overflow: ellipsis`, and `white-space: nowrap` on an element. So, it won't work for multiline text.

If you want to truncate text that spans multiple lines, you'll need to use a different approach because CSS doesn't provide a native solution for multiline text truncation.

Here is a workaround using line-clamp in Tailwind CSS:

```html
<div className="ml-1 inline-block">
   <span>Label: </span>
   <span className="font-semibold overflow-hidden overflow-ellipsis">
     long texttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttt
   </span>
</div>
```

In your Tailwind CSS configuration, you need to enable `lineClamp` in the `theme` section:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  theme: {
    extend: {
      typography: (theme) => ({
        DEFAULT: {
          css: {
            // ...
          },
        },
      }),
      lineClamp: {
        1: '1',
        2: '2',
        3: '3',
        // ...
      },
    },
  },
  variants: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [
    require('@tailwindcss/typography'),
    require('@tailwindcss/line-clamp'),
  ],
};
```

Then you can use `line-clamp-{n}` to limit the number of lines:

```html
<div className="ml-1 inline-block">
   <span>Label: </span>
   <span className="font-semibold line-clamp-1">
     long texttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttt
   </span>
</div>
```

This will limit the text to 1 line and add an ellipsis if it overflows.
