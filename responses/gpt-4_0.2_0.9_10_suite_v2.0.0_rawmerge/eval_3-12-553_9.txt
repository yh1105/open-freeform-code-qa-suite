The error message indicates that your Flutter project isn't using AndroidX, which is the open-source project used by the Android team to develop, test, package, version and release libraries within Jetpack. AndroidX is a major improvement to the original Android Support Library. It provides backward-compatibility for Android features.

To fix this issue, you need to migrate your project to AndroidX. Here are the steps to do this:

1. Backup your project.
2. Open your project's `android/gradle.properties` file.
3. Add the following lines:

    ```markdown
    android.useAndroidX=true
    android.enableJetifier=true
    ```

4. Update your `compileSdkVersion` to 28 in your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

    ```markdown
    android {
        compileSdkVersion 28

        ...
    }
    ```

5. Change your app dependencies to the AndroidX equivalents. For example, if you're using the `android.support` libraries in your `android/app/build.gradle`, you should change them to use the `androidx` libraries instead.

6. Clean your project and rebuild.

If you're still having issues, you may need to manually migrate your project to AndroidX. This can be done in Android Studio:

1. Backup your project.
2. Open your project in Android Studio.
3. Select `Refactor > Migrate to AndroidX` from the menu.
4. Follow the prompts and accept the changes.

After these steps, you should be able to build your project without any issues.
