The issue here is that the `operator==` in your base class `IClient` is expecting a reference to an `IClient` object, but in your derived class `SeviceClient` you're trying to override it with a function that expects a reference to a `SeviceClient` object. 

To fix this, you should make sure that the `operator==` in your derived class also expects a reference to an `IClient` object. However, you'll need to downcast this `IClient` reference to a `SeviceClient` reference inside the function body. Here's how you can do it:

```c++
bool operator==(const IClient<int8_t>& anotherClient) override {
    const SeviceClient& anotherServiceClient = dynamic_cast<const SeviceClient&>(anotherClient);
    // Now you can compare this object with anotherServiceClient
    return true;
}
```

Please note that `dynamic_cast` can throw a `std::bad_cast` exception if the casting fails. You should handle this exception appropriately in your code. 

Also, it's important to note that `operator==` should be a const member function, as it's not supposed to change the state of the object. So, you should declare it as `bool operator==(const IClient<int8_t>& anotherClient) const override`. 

Lastly, your base class `IClient` should have a virtual destructor to avoid potential memory leaks. You can add it like this:

```c++
virtual ~IClient() {}
```
