In Rust, `Box<T>` is a smart pointer that cannot be null. If you want to have an optional `Box<T>`, you should use `Option<Box<T>>`. When the `Option` is `None`, it's similar to having a null pointer in other languages. Here's how you can modify your code:

```rust
struct Node {
    value: i32,
    next: Option<Box<Node>>,
}

struct Stack {
    top: Option<Box<Node>>,
}
```

In this case, `None` represents an empty stack or the end of the stack. You can check if the `Box<Node>` is `None` (similar to null) using the `is_none()` method:

```rust
if stack.top.is_none() {
    println!("The stack is empty");
}
```

Or you can use pattern matching:

```rust
match stack.top {
    Some(_) => println!("The stack is not empty"),
    None => println!("The stack is empty"),
}
```
