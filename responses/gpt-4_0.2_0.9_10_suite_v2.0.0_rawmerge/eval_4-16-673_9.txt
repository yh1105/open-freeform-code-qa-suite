The `apt-get install` command installs the version of the software that is available in the repositories configured for your system. If the latest version of `cmake` is not available in these repositories, `apt-get install cmake` will not install the latest version.

To install the latest version of `cmake`, you can download it from the official website and compile it from source. Here are the steps to do this:

1. First, you need to uninstall the existing version of `cmake`:

```bash
sudo apt-get remove cmake
```

2. Then, download the latest version of `cmake` from the official website. At the time of writing this, the latest version is 3.21.1. You can download it with `wget`:

```bash
wget https://github.com/Kitware/CMake/releases/download/v3.21.1/cmake-3.21.1.tar.gz
```

3. Extract the downloaded file:

```bash
tar -xzvf cmake-3.21.1.tar.gz
```

4. Navigate to the extracted directory:

```bash
cd cmake-3.21.1
```

5. Now, you can compile and install `cmake`. This will install `cmake` in the `/usr/local` directory:

```bash
./bootstrap
make
sudo make install
```

6. Verify the installed version of `cmake`:

```bash
cmake --version
```

This should display the version of `cmake` you just installed.

Please note that compiling from source might take some time. Also, you need to have the necessary permissions to install software on your system.
