In Rust, the caret operator (`^`) is not used for exponentiation. It is actually the bitwise XOR operator. 

To perform exponentiation in Rust, you can use the `pow` method for integers. Here's an example:

```rust
fn main() {
    let base = 2;
    let exponent = 3;
    let result = base.pow(exponent);
    println!("{}", result);  // Outputs: 8
}
```

In this example, `2.pow(3)` raises `2` to the power of `3`, resulting in `8`.

For floating-point numbers, you can use the `powf` method:

```rust
fn main() {
    let base = 2.0;
    let exponent = 3.0;
    let result = base.powf(exponent);
    println!("{}", result);  // Outputs: 8
}
```

In this example, `2.0.powf(3.0)` raises `2.0` to the power of `3.0`, resulting in `8.0`.
