Yes, there is a known issue with Safari and flexbox where images don't respect the `height: auto` rule. This is because Safari has a different interpretation of the flexbox specification.

To fix this issue, you can set `align-self: flex-start` to the image. This will align the image at the start of the cross axis, and it will no longer stretch to fill the container.

Here's the updated CSS:

```css
.container {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
}

.container section:first-child {
  display: flex;
  margin-bottom: 25px;
}

.container img {
  width: 125px;
  height: auto;
  align-self: flex-start; /* Add this line */
}
```

This should make the image respect the `height: auto` rule in Safari.
