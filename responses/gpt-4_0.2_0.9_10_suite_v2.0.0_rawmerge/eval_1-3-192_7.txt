Here is a Python solution using the `re` module:

```python
import re

def to_camel_case(text):
    words = re.split('-|_', text)
    return words[0] + ''.join(word.capitalize() for word in words[1:])
```

This function works by first splitting the input string into a list of words, using either a dash or underscore as the delimiter. The `re.split` function is used to split the string, which allows for multiple delimiters.

Then, it returns a new string that is constructed by joining together the first word in the list (which is left as is) and the rest of the words (which are capitalized). The `capitalize` method is used to capitalize the first character of a string and make all other characters lowercase.

This function handles both Upper Camel Case and lower camel case, as the first word in the string is left as is (preserving its original capitalization), while all subsequent words are capitalized.
