Yes, in Flutter you can draw a vertical line (vertical divider) between components using the `VerticalDivider` widget.

Here is a simple example:

```dart
Row(
  children: <Widget>[
    Expanded(
      child: Text('Component 1'),
    ),
    const VerticalDivider(
      color: Colors.grey,
      thickness: 1,
      width: 20,
    ),
    Expanded(
      child: Text('Component 2'),
    ),
  ],
)
```

In this example, a vertical line is drawn between two text components. The `VerticalDivider` widget is used to create the line. You can customize the color, thickness, and width of the line.

Please note that the `VerticalDivider` widget is only visible when used in a `Row` or `Flex` widget. It won't be visible if you use it in a `Column` widget because it's a vertical line.
