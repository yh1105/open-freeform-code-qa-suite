Sure, the problem is that you are mocking the `API` class as an object, not as a class. Here is the revised version of your code:

```javascript
import API from 'utils/API';

jest.mock('utils/API', () => {
  return jest.fn().mockImplementation(() => {
    return {someMethod: () => {}};
  });
});
```

In this revised version, `jest.fn().mockImplementation()` is used to mock the `API` class. This way, you can create a new instance of `API` without any issues.
