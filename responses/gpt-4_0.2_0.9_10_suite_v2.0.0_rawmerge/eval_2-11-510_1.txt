The error "error: ‘std::filesystem’ has not been declared" is due to the fact that the `std::filesystem` is not part of the `std` namespace in C++17. Instead, it is part of the `std::experimental` namespace. 

You should use `std::experimental::filesystem` instead of `std::filesystem`. 

Here is the corrected code:

```c++
#include <experimental/filesystem>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

int main(int argc, char** argv)
{
    std::string imageDirectory = "./image";
    std::vector<std::string> imagePath;
    for (const auto& entry: std::experimental::filesystem::directory_iterator(imageDirectory))
    {
        imagePath.push_back(entry.path());
        std::cout << entry.path() << std::endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
```

Also, make sure that you have the necessary library installed and linked. If you are using g++, you might need to link the filesystem library using `-lstdc++fs`. 

For example:

```bash
g++ main.cpp -lstdc++fs -o main
```

Please note that since C++17, the filesystem library has been standardized and you can use `std::filesystem` instead of `std::experimental::filesystem` if your compiler supports C++17 or later.
