The `.attrs()` function in styled-components is a chainable method that attaches additional props to a component. It's useful when you want to apply some default props or derive some props based on the props passed to the component.

Here's a simple example:

```jsx
const Input = styled.input.attrs(props => ({
  type: 'text',
  size: props.small ? 5 : 10,
}))`
  color: palevioletred;
  font-size: 1em;
  border: 2px solid palevioletred;
  border-radius: 3px;
  margin: 0.5em;
  padding: 0.25em 0.5em;
  ::placeholder {
    color: palevioletred;
  }
`;

// Usage
<Input placeholder="A small text input" small />
<Input placeholder="A bigger text input" />
```

In this example, `attrs()` is used to set the `type` attribute to `'text'` and conditionally set the `size` attribute based on the `small` prop. This way, you can control the size of the input by passing a `small` prop to the `Input` component. 

Without `attrs()`, you would have to pass these attributes every time you use the `Input` component, or handle this logic inside the component itself which could make it more complex.
