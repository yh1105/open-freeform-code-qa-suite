Your code has some issues. You are trying to use `query` and `currentSheet` as objects but you are assigning them string values. Also, you are trying to use `query.Name` but `query` is a string, not an object. 

Here is a corrected version of your code:

```vba
Sub LoadToWorksheetOnly()

    Dim query As String
    Dim currentSheet As String
    
    ' Get the query from Sheet6 cell A1
    query = Sheets("Sheet6").Range("A1").Value
    
    ' Get the name of the active sheet
    currentSheet = ActiveSheet.Name
    
    ' Create a new ListObject with a QueryTable that uses the Power Query connection string
    With ActiveSheet.ListObjects.Add(SourceType:=0, Source:= _
        "OLEDB;Provider=Microsoft.Mashup.OleDb.1;Data Source=$Workbook$;Location=" & query _
        , Destination:=Sheets("target").Range("$A$1")).QueryTable
        .CommandType = xlCmdDefault
        .CommandText = Array("SELECT * FROM [" & query & "]")
        .RowNumbers = False
        .FillAdjacentFormulas = False
        .PreserveFormatting = True
        .RefreshOnFileOpen = False
        .BackgroundQuery = True
        .RefreshStyle = xlInsertDeleteCells
        .SavePassword = False
        .SaveData = True
        .AdjustColumnWidth = True
        .RefreshPeriod = 0
        .PreserveColumnInfo = False
        .Refresh BackgroundQuery:=False
    End With
     
End Sub
```

This code will create a new QueryTable in the "target" sheet that uses the Power Query connection string. The query itself is taken from cell A1 in Sheet6. The QueryTable will be refreshed immediately after it is created.
