Based on your HTML structure, it seems like your `Stop Game` button is inside the `GameRunning` div, which might be positioned behind the game frame. 

Here are some general methods to solve this issue:

1. **Change the HTML structure**: You can move the `StopBtn` outside of the `GameRunning` div or place it in the same div where the `StartBtn` is located. This way, you can ensure that both buttons are in the same container and will not be affected by the positioning of the game frame.

2. **Use CSS positioning**: If you want to keep your current HTML structure, you can use CSS to position your `StopBtn`. You can use `position: absolute;` or `position: relative;` to move your button to the desired location. Remember to set the parent container's position property to `position: relative;` if you're using `position: absolute;` for the child element.

3. **Use CSS z-index**: If the problem is that the `StopBtn` is behind the game frame, you can use the `z-index` property to bring it to the front. The `z-index` property specifies the stack order of an element. An element with greater stack order is always in front of an element with a lower stack order. Note that `z-index` only works on positioned elements (`position: absolute;`, `position: relative;`, or `position: fixed;`).

Here's an example of how you can use CSS to position your `StopBtn`:

```css
#GameRunning {
  position: relative;
}

#StopBtn {
  position: absolute;
  top: 0;
  right: 0;
  z-index: 1;
}
```

This will position your `StopBtn` at the top right corner of the `GameRunning` div and ensure it's not behind any other elements within the same container. Adjust the `top` and `right` values as needed to align it properly with the `StartBtn`.
