You can use the `merge` function in pandas to merge two dataframes and then filter out the common rows. Here is a function that does this:

```python
import pandas as pd

def getDifference(df1, df2):
    # Merge the dataframes, indicator=True adds a '_merge' column
    df = pd.merge(df1, df2, how='outer', indicator=True)

    # Filter out the rows that are only in df1 (not in df2)
    df3 = df[df['_merge'] == 'left_only']

    # Drop the '_merge' column
    df3 = df3.drop(columns=['_merge'])

    return df3
```

This function works by merging `df1` and `df2` using an outer join, which includes all rows from both dataframes. The `indicator=True` argument adds a column called `_merge` to the resulting dataframe, which indicates whether each row is from `df1` only, `df2` only, or both.

The function then filters out the rows that are only in `df1` (not in `df2`) by checking the `_merge` column, and finally drops the `_merge` column before returning the result.

Note: This function assumes that `df1` and `df2` have the same columns. If they don't, you'll need to modify the function to handle this.
