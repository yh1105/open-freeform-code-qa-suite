## CSRF Token Mismatch

The CSRF token mismatch issue could be due to several reasons. Here are a few things you could check:

1. **Domain Configuration**: Ensure that your domain is correctly configured to point to the public directory of your Laravel application. Misconfiguration could lead to issues with session handling.

2. **Cookie Configuration**: Check your `config/session.php` file and ensure that the `domain` and `path` options are correctly set. If your application is on a subdomain, you might need to set the `domain` option to your root domain prefixed with a dot (e.g., `.yourdomain.com`).

3. **HTTPS**: If your application is served over HTTPS, ensure that the `secure` option in your `config/session.php` file is set to `true`.

4. **Middleware**: Ensure that the `VerifyCsrfToken` middleware is included in the `web` middleware group in your `app/Http/Kernel.php` file.

## Email Sending Issue

The error message you're getting indicates that there's an issue with the SSL connection to your SMTP server. Here are a few things you could check:

1. **Encryption Type**: You might be using the wrong encryption type. Try changing `MAIL_ENCRYPTION` in your `.env` file from `ssl` to `tls`.

2. **Port Number**: The port number might be incorrect. Common port numbers for SMTP are 25, 465, and 587. Check with your email provider to confirm the correct port number.

3. **Firewall Settings**: Your server's firewall settings might be blocking the connection to the SMTP server. You might need to adjust these settings to allow the connection.

4. **OpenSSL Version**: The version of OpenSSL installed on your server might be incompatible with the SMTP server. You might need to update or downgrade OpenSSL.

Remember to clear your config cache (`php artisan config:cache`) after making changes to your `.env` file or config files.
