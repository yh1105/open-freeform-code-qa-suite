The `rename` function is used to rename the DataFrame's index or columns directly, not the series. When you use `groupby` and `mean`, it returns a series, not a DataFrame. That's why you're getting an error.

Here's how you can modify your function to achieve your goal:

```python
def renameDataFrame(df):
    avg = df.groupby(["t"], sort=False)["p"].mean().reset_index()
    avg = avg.rename(columns = {"p":"mean"})
    return avg
```

In this function, `reset_index` is used to convert the series to a DataFrame. Then, you can use `rename` to rename the column. 

Here's how you can use this function:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# Assuming datain is your numpy array
datain = np.array([[1, 2, 3, 4, 5], [1, 3, 4, 5, 6], [2, 4, 5, 6, 7]])
df = pd.DataFrame(data = datain, columns = ["t","p","x","y","z"])

avg = renameDataFrame(df)
print(avg)
```

This will print:

```
   t  mean
0  1   2.5
1  2   4.0
```

This means that the average of column "p" grouped by column "t" is calculated and the column name "p" is renamed to "mean".
