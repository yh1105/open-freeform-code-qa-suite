You can modify your VBA code to remove the spaces by not replacing the special characters with a space (" "), but with an empty string (""). Here's how you can do it:

```vba
Sub ReplaceSpecial()
    Dim cel As Range
    Dim strVal As String
    Dim i As Long
    Application.ScreenUpdating = False
    For Each cel In Selection
        strVal = cel.Value
        For i = Len(strVal) To 1 Step -1
            Select Case Asc(Mid(strVal, i, 1))
                Case 32, 48 To 57, 65 To 90, 97 To 122
                    ' Leave ordinary characters alone
                Case Else
                    strVal = Left(strVal, i - 1) & Right(strVal, Len(strVal) - i)
            End Select
        Next i
        cel.Value = strVal
    Next cel
    Application.ScreenUpdating = True
End Sub
```

In this code, instead of replacing the special character with a space, we are removing it by concatenating the part of the string before the special character (`Left(strVal, i - 1)`) and the part of the string after the special character (`Right(strVal, Len(strVal) - i)`).

Also, note that the loop is now going backwards (`For i = Len(strVal) To 1 Step -1`). This is because removing characters from the string changes its length, which can cause problems if you're iterating forwards.
