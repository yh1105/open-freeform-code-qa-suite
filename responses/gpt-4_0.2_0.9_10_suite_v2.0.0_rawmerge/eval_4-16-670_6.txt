Yes, you can convert your OpenSSH private key to an RSA private key using the `ssh-keygen` tool. Here's how:

1. Convert the OpenSSH private key to an RSA private key:

```bash
ssh-keygen -p -m PEM -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```

This command will prompt you for your passphrase (if any), and then it will write the RSA private key out to the same file (`~/.ssh/id_rsa`).

The `-p` option tells `ssh-keygen` to change the passphrase of a private key file, `-m PEM` tells it to use the older PEM private key format instead of the new OpenSSH format, and `-f ~/.ssh/id_rsa` specifies the file to convert.

2. You don't need to convert your public key. The public key format is standard and doesn't have the same compatibility issues as the private key. The public key doesn't have a header like the private key, so you don't need to worry about that.

Please remember to backup your keys before performing these operations.
