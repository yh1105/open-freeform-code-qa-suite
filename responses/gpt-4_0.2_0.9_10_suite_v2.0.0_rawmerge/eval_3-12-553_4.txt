The error message indicates that your Flutter project isn't using AndroidX, which is the open-source project used by the Android team to develop, test, package, version and release libraries within Jetpack. AndroidX is a major improvement to the original Android Support Library and all new Android projects are using AndroidX.

To solve this issue, you need to migrate your project to AndroidX. Here are the steps to do this:

1. Backup your project.
2. Open your project's `android/gradle.properties` file.
3. Add the following lines:

    ```markdown
    android.useAndroidX=true
    android.enableJetifier=true
    ```

4. Update your `compileSdkVersion` to `28` in your `android/app/build.gradle` file.
5. Change your app's dependencies to the AndroidX equivalents. Here is a [mapping of old classes to AndroidX](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/migrate/class-mappings).

After these steps, try to build your project again. If you still encounter issues, you might need to manually migrate your dependencies to their AndroidX equivalents.

If you're using any third-party Flutter plugins, make sure they also support AndroidX. If they don't, you might need to fork the plugin and migrate it yourself, or find an alternative plugin that supports AndroidX.
