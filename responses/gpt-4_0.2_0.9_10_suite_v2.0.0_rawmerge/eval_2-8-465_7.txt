The `ext-zip` is a PHP extension for handling zip archives. It's not a Composer package, so you can't install it using `composer require`.

If you're using a Unix-like operating system, you can install it via the terminal:

```bash
sudo apt-get install php-zip
```

If you're using Windows, you can enable it in your `php.ini` file by uncommenting (or adding) the line:

```ini
extension=php_zip.dll
```

After installing or enabling the extension, you should restart your web server to make the changes take effect.

Then, you can add the extension to your `composer.json` file to ensure that it's available when your project is installed on another system:

```json
{
    "require": {
        "php": "^7.1.3",
        "ext-zip": "*"
    }
}
```

After adding this to your `composer.json`, run `composer update` to update your `composer.lock` file.
