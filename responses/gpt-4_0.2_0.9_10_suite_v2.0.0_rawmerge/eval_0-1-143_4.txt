Yes, you can modify the CSS to reduce the spacing between menu items in Firefox Proton. Here are the steps:

1. Open Firefox and type `about:config` in the address bar and press `Enter`.

2. Click on `Accept the Risk and Continue`.

3. In the search bar, type `toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets` and set its value to `true` by clicking on the toggle button.

4. Now, navigate to your Firefox profile folder. You can find it by typing `about:support` in the address bar and then clicking on `Open Folder` next to `Profile Folder`.

5. In the profile folder, create a new folder named `chrome` if it doesn't exist.

6. Inside the `chrome` folder, create a new file named `userChrome.css`. If the file already exists, you can edit it.

7. Open `userChrome.css` with a text editor and paste the following code:

```css
/* Reduce Menu and Contextual Menu height */
:root {
  --arrowpanel-menuitem-padding: 4px 8px !important;
}

menupopup > menuitem, menupopup > menu {
  padding-block: var(--arrowpanel-menuitem-padding) !important;
}
```

8. Save the file and restart Firefox.

This CSS code reduces the padding around menu items, effectively reducing the spacing between them. You can adjust the padding values (4px 8px in this case) to your liking. The first value is the vertical padding (top and bottom) and the second value is the horizontal padding (left and right). 

Please note that these changes might not persist across updates and could potentially cause issues with future Firefox versions.
