The Angular CLI doesn't provide a specific command to remove a package. The `ng add` command is used to add a package and run an installation script if one is provided by the package. 

To remove a package, you can use the npm uninstall command:

```bash
npm uninstall <package-name>
```

This command will remove the package from your `node_modules` directory and also from the `package.json` file.

If you want to remove it only from `node_modules` but keep it in `package.json`, you can use the `--no-save` option:

```bash
npm uninstall <package-name> --no-save
```

Remember to replace `<package-name>` with the name of the package you want to remove.
