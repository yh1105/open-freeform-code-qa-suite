Creating a calendar input in VBA Excel can be done using a UserForm and a ComboBox. Here's a simple example:

1. First, create a new UserForm in VBA (Insert > UserForm).
2. Add a ComboBox to the UserForm (Toolbox > ComboBox).
3. Double click on the UserForm and add the following code to the UserForm_Initialize() event:

```vba
Private Sub UserForm_Initialize()
    Dim i As Integer
    For i = 1 To 31
        ComboBox1.AddItem i
    Next i
End Sub
```

This will populate the ComboBox with numbers 1 to 31, representing the days of a month.

4. To use this UserForm, you can call it from a Sub procedure like this:

```vba
Sub ShowForm()
    UserForm1.Show
End Sub
```

This is a very basic example and doesn't take into account different month lengths or years. For a more robust solution, you might want to consider using a third-party date picker control, or using Excel's built-in date picker if it's available in your version of Excel.
