In R, when you bind two data frames with the same column names using `cbind()`, the column names of the resulting data frame are made unique by adding a suffix. In your case, the column names of `d3` would be `a` and `a.1`. 

So, to select the second column by name, you can use:

```r
second_col <- d3$a.1
```

However, if you still see two columns with the same name `a` in your RStudio environment, it might be due to some version-specific behavior or a bug. In such a case, you can select the second column by its index:

```r
second_col <- d3[,2]
```

This will select the second column regardless of its name.
