The error message is indicating that the `go_package` option is missing in your proto file. This option is used to specify the package name for the generated Go code.

You can fix this by adding a `go_package` option to your proto file. Here is how you can do it:

```go
syntax="proto3";

package main;

option go_package = "main";

message Person {
      string name = 1;
      int32 age = 2;
}
```

In this example, `main` is the name of the Go package for the generated code. You should replace `main` with the actual package name you want to use.

After adding the `go_package` option, you can run the `protoc` command again to generate the Go code:

```bash
protoc --go_out=. simple.proto
```

This should generate the Go code without any errors.
