You can use the `sort_by` function provided by Rust's standard library. This function sorts a vector in-place using a comparator function. In your case, you can compare first by `row` and then by `column` if the rows are equal.

Here is how you can do it:

```rust
my_vector.sort_by(|a, b| {
    a.row.cmp(&b.row)
        .then_with(|| a.column.cmp(&b.column))
});
```

In this code, `cmp` is a function that compares two values and returns an `Ordering` (Less, Equal, or Greater). `then_with` is a function that chains two comparisons: if the first comparison is Equal, it performs the second comparison.

This will sort your vector first by `row`, and then by `column` within each group of equal `row` values.
