The `ext-zip` is a PHP extension, not a Composer package, so you cannot install it using Composer. The error message you're seeing is because Composer is trying to find a package named `ext-zip`, but it doesn't exist.

The `ext-zip` extension is used for zip file manipulations in PHP. If you're missing this extension, you'll need to install it via your PHP installation.

If you're using a Unix-like operating system, you can install the `zip` extension with the following command:

```bash
sudo apt-get install php-zip
```

Or if you're using multiple PHP versions, specify the version like so:

```bash
sudo apt-get install php7.3-zip
```

If you're on Windows, you'll need to enable the extension in your `php.ini` file. Find the line that looks like this:

```bash
;extension=php_zip.dll
```

And remove the semicolon at the start to enable it:

```bash
extension=php_zip.dll
```

After installing or enabling the extension, don't forget to restart your web server to make sure the changes take effect.

Once the extension is installed, you can tell Composer that your project requires it by adding it to your `composer.json` file like so:

```json
"require": {
    "php": "^7.3",
    "ext-zip": "*"
}
```

This won't install the extension (as it needs to be installed via PHP), but it will prevent Composer from installing your project unless the `ext-zip` extension is present.
