The `ext-zip` is a reference to the ZIP PHP extension. This is not a package that you can install via composer, but rather it's an extension that needs to be installed into PHP itself.

If you're using a Unix-like operating system, you can install the ZIP extension with the following command:

```bash
sudo apt-get install php-zip
```

If you're using Windows, you'll need to enable the extension in your `php.ini` file. You can do this by removing the semicolon from the start of the line that reads `;extension=php_zip.dll`.

After you've installed or enabled the ZIP extension, you should update your `composer.json` file to include the requirement for the ZIP extension. This can be done by adding the following line to the `require` section of your `composer.json`:

```json
"ext-zip": "*"
```

Then run `composer update` to update your project dependencies.

Remember to restart your web server after making these changes to ensure that they take effect.
