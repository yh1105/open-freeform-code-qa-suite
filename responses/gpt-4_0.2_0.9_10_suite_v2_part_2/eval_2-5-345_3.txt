The error you're encountering is due to a compatibility issue between IntelliJ IDEA and the Maven version (3.8.5) that comes with Spring Boot 2.7. IntelliJ IDEA has a built-in Maven 3 which is not compatible with Maven 3.8.5.

To resolve this issue, you can configure IntelliJ IDEA to use an external Maven instead of the built-in one. Here's how:

1. Open IntelliJ IDEA and go to `File > Settings` (or `IntelliJ IDEA > Preferences` for macOS).

2. In the Settings/Preferences dialog, expand the `Build, Execution, Deployment` node and select `Build Tools > Maven`.

3. On the right side, in the `Maven home directory` field, point to the directory where Maven is installed. This should be a version that is compatible with your project, for example, Maven 3.8.4.

4. Click `OK` to save the changes.

Now, IntelliJ IDEA will use the specified external Maven for building and running your Maven projects. This should resolve the error you're encountering. 

If you don't have Maven installed, you can download it from the [official Apache Maven website](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi). After downloading, extract the archive to a directory of your choice. This is the directory you should point to in the `Maven home directory` field in IntelliJ IDEA.
