The error message you're seeing is likely due to the Gradle version you're using. Gradle versions prior to 7.0 do not support Java 17. 

You can check your Gradle version by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
./gradlew --version
```

If your Gradle version is less than 7.0, you need to upgrade it. You can do this by changing the Gradle version in your `gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.properties` file. 

For example, to upgrade to Gradle 7.3, you would change the `distributionUrl` line in `gradle-wrapper.properties` to:

```
distributionUrl=https\://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-7.3-bin.zip
```

After changing the Gradle version, you should be able to build and run your project with Java 17. 

Also, make sure that your `build.gradle` file has the correct `sourceCompatibility`:

```groovy
sourceCompatibility = '17'
```

And that the `java` plugin is applied:

```groovy
plugins {
    id 'java'
}
```

If you're still having issues after trying these steps, please let me know and I'll be happy to help further.
