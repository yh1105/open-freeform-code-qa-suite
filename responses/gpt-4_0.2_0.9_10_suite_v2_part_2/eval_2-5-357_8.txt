The `@Autowired` annotation is not necessary if the target bean only defines one constructor. As of Spring 4.3, if a class only declares a single constructor, Spring will consider that constructor as the autowire target. 

However, if there are multiple constructors, Spring won't know which one to choose, so you'll need to place `@Autowired` on the constructor you want Spring to use for autowiring.

In addition, using `@Autowired` can make the dependency injection explicit, which can be helpful for readability and understanding the code. It makes it clear that Spring is responsible for wiring the dependencies. 

In conclusion, while it's not necessary to use `@Autowired` on single-constructor classes, it can still be a good practice for clarity and in case of multiple constructors.
