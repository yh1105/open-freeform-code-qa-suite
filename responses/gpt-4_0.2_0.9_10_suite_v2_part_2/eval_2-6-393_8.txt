The error message is telling you that you cannot create an index on a navigation property. In Entity Framework, navigation properties are used to establish relationships between entities (like `User` and `Gender` in your case), but they cannot be used to create an index.

Indexes in Entity Framework are used to speed up the performance of data retrieval operations on a database. They can only be created on scalar properties, not on navigation properties.

So, you should remove the line where you're trying to create an index on the `Gender` navigation property:

```csharp
user.HasIndex(x => x.Gender); // Remove this line
```

Your `OnModelCreating` method should look like this:

```csharp
protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder modelBuilder)
{
    modelBuilder.Entity<User>(user =>
    {
        user
            .HasOne(x => x.Gender)
            .WithMany(x => x.Users)
            .HasForeignKey(x => x.GenderId);
    });
}
```

If you want to create an index on `GenderId` (which is a scalar property), you can do it like this:

```csharp
protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder modelBuilder)
{
    modelBuilder.Entity<User>(user =>
    {
        user
            .HasOne(x => x.Gender)
            .WithMany(x => x.Users)
            .HasForeignKey(x => x.GenderId);

        user.HasIndex(x => x.GenderId); // Create an index on GenderId
    });
}
```
