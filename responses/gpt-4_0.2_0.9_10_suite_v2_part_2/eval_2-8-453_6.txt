The `err113` linter is complaining because you're creating new errors inline with `errors.New()`. This is considered bad practice because it makes it harder to check for specific errors.

The recommended way to handle this is to define your errors as package-level variables, and then wrap them with `%w` when needed. Here's how you can do it:

```go
var (
    ErrRepoGave = errors.New("repo gave err")
    ErrOops = errors.New("oops")
)
```

Then, in your tests, you can use these errors directly:

```go
repoMock.EXPECT().Save(gomock.Eq(&foooBarBar)).Return(nil, ErrRepoGave)
repoMock.EXPECT().FindAll().Return(nil, ErrOops)
```

If you need to add more context to an error, you can use `fmt.Errorf()` to wrap the original error:

```go
return fmt.Errorf("while saving fooBarBar: %w", ErrRepoGave)
```

This way, you can check for errors using `errors.Is()`:

```go
if errors.Is(err, ErrRepoGave) {
    // handle specific error
}
```

This approach makes your error handling more robust and your code easier to understand.
