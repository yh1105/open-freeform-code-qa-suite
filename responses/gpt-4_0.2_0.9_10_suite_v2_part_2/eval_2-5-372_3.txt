The error message you're seeing indicates that the Hibernate Validator can't find a validator for the `@NotEmpty` and `@NotBlank` constraints. This is because these constraints were introduced in Hibernate Validator 6.0.0.Final, but your application is using Hibernate Validator 5.3.5.Final-redhat-2, which doesn't support these constraints. 

In Hibernate Validator 5.x, you can use `@NotNull` and `@Size(min=1)` to achieve similar validation.

If you want to use `@NotEmpty` and `@NotBlank`, you need to upgrade to Hibernate Validator 6.0.0.Final or later. 

However, Spring Boot 2.0.4.RELEASE comes with Hibernate Validator 6.0.7.Final by default. It seems like your application is being overridden by JBoss to use Hibernate Validator 5.3.5.Final-redhat-2.

To solve this, you can try to exclude the Hibernate Validator from JBoss and add the Hibernate Validator 6.0.11.Final to your `pom.xml`:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.hibernate.validator</groupId>
    <artifactId>hibernate-validator</artifactId>
    <version>6.0.11.Final</version>
</dependency>
```

Also, make sure that you're using the correct import for the `@NotEmpty` and `@NotBlank` annotations:

```java
import javax.validation.constraints.NotEmpty;
import javax.validation.constraints.NotBlank;
```

If you're still facing issues, you might need to check your JBoss configuration to ensure that it's not overriding the Hibernate Validator version.
