This error is caused by the incompatibility between the Maven version (3.8.5) used in the project generated by start.spring.io and the Maven version supported by your IntelliJ IDEA.

IntelliJ IDEA has an embedded Maven that it uses for importing projects. The version of this embedded Maven might not be compatible with the newer version of Maven used in your project.

Here are some steps you can follow to resolve this issue:

1. **Update IntelliJ IDEA**: Make sure you are using the latest version of IntelliJ IDEA. JetBrains regularly releases updates that include support for the latest versions of Maven. You can check for updates by going to `Help > Check for Updates...` in IntelliJ IDEA.

2. **Configure IntelliJ IDEA to use the project's Maven version**: You can configure IntelliJ IDEA to use the same version of Maven as your project instead of the embedded version. Here's how you can do it:

    - Go to `File > Settings` (or `IntelliJ IDEA > Preferences` for macOS).
    - In the Settings/Preferences dialog, go to `Build, Execution, Deployment > Build Tools > Maven`.
    - In the Maven settings, for the `Maven home directory` option, select the directory where your project's Maven version is installed. If Maven is installed correctly on your system, IntelliJ IDEA should automatically detect it and list it in the dropdown menu.
    - Click `OK` to save the settings.

3. **Downgrade the Maven version in your project**: If the above solutions don't work, you can downgrade the Maven version in your project to a version that is compatible with your IntelliJ IDEA. You can do this by modifying the `maven-wrapper.properties` file in your project:

    ```markdown
    distributionUrl=https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/org/apache/maven/apache-maven/3.8.1/apache-maven-3.8.1-bin.zip
    ```

    Replace `3.8.5` with `3.8.1` or any other version that is compatible with your IntelliJ IDEA.

Remember to re-import your project in IntelliJ IDEA after making these changes.
