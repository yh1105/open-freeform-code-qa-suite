The issue you're facing might be due to the change in the default URL for Swagger UI. In the newer versions of springdoc-openapi-ui, the Swagger UI is not available at `/swagger-ui.html` anymore. Instead, it is available at `/swagger-ui/index.html`.

So, try accessing Swagger UI at `http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html` or `http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/`.

If you want to customize the Swagger UI path, you can do so by adding the following property to your `application.properties` or `application.yml` file:

```properties
springdoc.swagger-ui.path=/swagger-ui.html
```

This will make Swagger UI available at the old default URL (`http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html`).

Also, make sure that you have the necessary configuration to enable Swagger in your Spring Boot application. If not, add the following annotation to your main Spring Boot application class:

```java
@SpringBootApplication
@EnableOpenApi
public class Application {
    // ...
}
```

The `@EnableOpenApi` annotation is used to enable Swagger support in the application.
