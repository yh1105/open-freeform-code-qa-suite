The `AbstractController::getDoctrine()` method is deprecated since Symfony 4.2. The alternative is to use dependency injection to get the Doctrine service.

Before, you might have used:

```php
$em = $this->getDoctrine()->getManager();
```

Now, you should inject the `EntityManagerInterface` into your controller method:

```php
use Doctrine\ORM\EntityManagerInterface;

public function myFunction(EntityManagerInterface $em)
{
    // ...
}
```

This way, Symfony will automatically inject the `EntityManager` into your method when it's called. This is part of Symfony's move towards more explicit dependency injection, which makes your code more decoupled and easier to test.
