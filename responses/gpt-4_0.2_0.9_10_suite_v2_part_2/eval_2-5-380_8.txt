The issue you're experiencing might be due to the change in the default URL for Swagger UI. Starting from version 1.3.9 of springdoc-openapi-ui, the Swagger UI is available at a new URL.

Try accessing Swagger UI at this URL: `http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html` or `http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/`

If you want to customize the Swagger UI path, you can do so by adding the following property to your `application.properties` file:

```properties
springdoc.swagger-ui.path=/swagger-ui.html
```

After adding this property, you should be able to access Swagger UI at `http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html`.

Also, make sure that your Spring Boot application is running and that you've correctly configured Springdoc OpenAPI in your application.
