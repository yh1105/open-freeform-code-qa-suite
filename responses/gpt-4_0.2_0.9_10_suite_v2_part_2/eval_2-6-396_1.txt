The error is happening because you are trying to create an index on a navigation property `Gender`. Entity Framework does not support creating indexes on navigation properties. 

Indexes in Entity Framework are used to speed up the performance of data retrieval operations on a database. They are created on columns in the database. Navigation properties in Entity Framework are not represented as columns in the database, they are used in the object model to establish relations between entities.

You should create an index on the foreign key property `GenderId` instead of the navigation property `Gender`. Here is how you can do it:

```c#
protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder modelBuilder)
{
    modelBuilder.Entity<User>(user =>
    {
        user
        .HasOne(x => x.Gender)
        .WithMany(x => x.Users)
        .HasForeignKey(x => x.GenderId);

        user.HasIndex(x => x.GenderId);
    });
}
```

Now, when you run the migration command, it should work without any errors.
