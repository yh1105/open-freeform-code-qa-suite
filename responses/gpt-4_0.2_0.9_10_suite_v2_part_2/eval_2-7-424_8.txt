The error message "Failed to clear cache. Make sure you have the appropriate permissions." suggests that Laravel is unable to write or delete files in the directory where the cache is stored. This is typically a file permissions issue.

Here are a few things you can check:

1. **File Permissions**: Ensure that the user running the `php artisan cache:clear` command has sufficient permissions to modify the cache files. This usually means that the user should be the owner of the files or in a group that has write permissions.

2. **Storage Directory**: Laravel stores cache files in the `storage/framework/cache` directory. Make sure this directory exists and has the correct permissions.

3. **File Ownership**: The files in your Laravel project should be owned by the user that the web server runs as. This is typically `www-data` for Apache on Ubuntu, or `nginx` for Nginx. You can change the ownership of the files with the `chown` command.

If you're not sure about the file permissions, you can temporarily set them to 777 to see if that resolves the issue. However, this gives all users read, write, and execute permissions, which is not recommended for a production environment. You can change the permissions with the `chmod` command. 

Here is how you can change the permissions and ownership:

```bash
sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /path/to/your/laravel/project
sudo chmod -R 777 /path/to/your/laravel/project/storage
```

Replace `/path/to/your/laravel/project` with the actual path to your Laravel project.
