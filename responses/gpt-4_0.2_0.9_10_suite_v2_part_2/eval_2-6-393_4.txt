The error message is indicating that you are trying to create an index on a navigation property (`Gender`), which is not allowed. Navigation properties are used to establish relationships between entities in Entity Framework, they are not actual columns in the database, so you can't create an index on them.

If you want to create an index on the `GenderId` property, you should do it like this:

```csharp
protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder modelBuilder)
{
    modelBuilder.Entity<User>(user =>
    {
        user
            .HasOne(x => x.Gender)
            .WithMany(x => x.Users)
            .HasForeignKey(x => x.GenderId);

        user.HasIndex(x => x.GenderId);
    });
}
```

In this code, `user.HasIndex(x => x.GenderId);` creates an index on the `GenderId` column of the `User` table.
