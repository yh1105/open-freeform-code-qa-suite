The issue you're facing might be due to the IntelliJ IDEA version you're using. IntelliJ IDEA 2017 does not fully support Java 11. 

Here are a few steps you can follow:

1. **Update IntelliJ IDEA**: The first thing you should do is update your IntelliJ IDEA to the latest version. As of now, the latest version is 2021.2.3. You can download it from the [official JetBrains website](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/). The latest versions have full support for Java 11.

2. **Set up JDK in IntelliJ IDEA**: After updating IntelliJ IDEA, you need to set up JDK 11 in it. Here's how to do it:

    - Go to `File > Project Structure > Project`.
    - In the `Project SDK` section, click on `New...` and select `JDK`.
    - Navigate to the directory where JDK 11 is installed (`C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-11.0.1` in your case) and select it.
    - Click `OK` to close the dialog.

3. **Set up the language level**: You also need to set the language level to 11. Here's how to do it:

    - Go to `File > Project Structure > Project`.
    - In the `Project language level` section, select `11 - Local variable syntax for lambda parameters`.
    - Click `OK` to close the dialog.

4. **Set up the compiler**: Lastly, you need to set up the compiler. Here's how to do it:

    - Go to `File > Settings > Build, Execution, Deployment > Compiler > Java Compiler`.
    - In the `Target bytecode version` section, select `11` for all your modules.
    - Click `OK` to close the dialog.

After following these steps, you should be able to compile and run your Java 11 application in IntelliJ IDEA.

Regarding your question about the JDK and JRE folders, starting from Java 9, Oracle provides JDK distributions only. The JRE is included in the JDK, so there's no need for a separate JRE folder.
