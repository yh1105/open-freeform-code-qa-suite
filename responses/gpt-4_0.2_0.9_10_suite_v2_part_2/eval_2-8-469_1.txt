The error message is indicating that the `go_package` option is missing in your `.proto` file. This option is used to specify the full Go package import path. 

You can fix this by adding the `go_package` option to your `.proto` file. Here's how to do it:

```go
syntax="proto3";

package main;

option go_package = "github.com/yourusername/yourrepository";

message Person {
      string name = 1;
      int32 age = 2;
}
```

Replace `"github.com/yourusername/yourrepository"` with the actual path where your Go files will be located.

After you've added the `go_package` option, you should be able to generate the Go code using the same command:

```bash
protoc --go_out=. simple.proto
```

This will generate a `simple.pb.go` file in the current directory.
