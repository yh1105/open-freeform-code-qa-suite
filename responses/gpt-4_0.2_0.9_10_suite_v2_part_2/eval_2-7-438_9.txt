The error message suggests that the migration class "20210909072642" was not found. This is because the command is not correctly referencing the namespace of the migration class.

Based on your configuration, your migrations are under the `Application\Migrations` namespace and are located in the `app/DoctrineMigrations` directory.

So, you should use the full namespace of the migration class in the command. Here is the correct command:

```bash
bin/console --env=dev doctrine:migrations:execute 'Application\Migrations\Version20210909072642' --down --no-interaction -vvv
```

This command will execute the `down` method of the `Version20210909072642` migration class, which will effectively rollback the changes made by this migration. The `--no-interaction` option will run the command without asking any interactive question and the `-vvv` option will increase the verbosity of messages: i.e., debug.
