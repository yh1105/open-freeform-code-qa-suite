The issue might be related to the URL you are trying to access. For Springdoc (OpenAPI 3.0), the Swagger UI is not available at `/swagger-ui.html` as it was with Springfox (Swagger 2.0). Instead, it is available at `/swagger-ui/index.html` or `/swagger-ui/`.

So, you should be able to access the Swagger UI at `http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/` or `http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html`.

If you still can't access the Swagger UI, please check the following:

1. Make sure you have the correct Springdoc version. The latest version at the time of writing is `1.6.11`.

2. Check if you have any configuration that might be disabling the Swagger UI. For example, in your `application.properties` or `application.yml`, make sure you don't have `springdoc.swagger-ui.enabled=false`.

3. If you have a custom context path, servlet path or server port, you need to include them in the URL. For example, if you have `server.servlet.context-path=/api`, then the Swagger UI should be available at `http://localhost:8080/api/swagger-ui/`.

4. Make sure your application is running and there are no errors in the logs related to Springdoc or Swagger UI.

5. If you have Spring Security, make sure it's not blocking access to the Swagger UI. You might need to permit all access to `/swagger-ui/**` and `/v3/api-docs/**`.

6. If you are using Spring Boot 2.3.0 or later, you might need to add the following property in your `application.properties` or `application.yml` to enable the Swagger UI:

```properties
springdoc.swagger-ui.enabled=true
```

7. If you are using Spring WebFlux, you need to add the `springdoc-openapi-webflux-ui` dependency instead of `springdoc-openapi-ui`.
