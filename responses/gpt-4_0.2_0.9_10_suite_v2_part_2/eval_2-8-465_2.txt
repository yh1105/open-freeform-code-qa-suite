The `ext-zip` is a PHP extension, not a Composer package, so you cannot install it using Composer. 

If you are using a Unix-like operating system, you can install it via the terminal with the following commands:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install php-zip
```

If you are using Windows, you can enable it in your `php.ini` file by uncommenting (or adding) the line:

```ini
extension=php_zip.dll
```

After you have installed or enabled the `ext-zip` extension, you should restart your web server to make sure the changes take effect.

Then, you can add `ext-zip` to your `composer.json` file manually:

```json
"require": {
    "php": "^7.1.3",
    "ext-zip": "*",
    // other dependencies...
}
```

After that, you can run `composer install` to install all the dependencies.

Remember, the `ext-zip` extension is used by some packages to manipulate zip files, so if PHPStorm suggests you to install it, probably some of your project's dependencies need it.
