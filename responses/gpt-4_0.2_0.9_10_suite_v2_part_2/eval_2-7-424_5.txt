The error message "Failed to clear cache. Make sure you have the appropriate permissions." suggests that the user running the `php artisan cache:clear` command doesn't have the necessary permissions to delete files in the cache directory.

This could be due to several reasons:

1. The user who is running the command does not have write permissions to the cache directory.
2. The cache directory could be owned by a different user.
3. The cache files could be owned by a different user.

To solve this issue, you could try the following:

- Check the permissions of the cache directory and its files. You can do this with the `ls -l` command in Unix-based systems.
- Change the ownership of the directory and its files to the user running the command. You can do this with the `chown` command in Unix-based systems.
- Change the permissions of the directory and its files to allow the user running the command to write to them. You can do this with the `chmod` command in Unix-based systems.

Remember to replace `/path/to/cache/directory` with the actual path to your cache directory in the commands below:

```bash
ls -l /path/to/cache/directory
sudo chown -R $USER:$USER /path/to/cache/directory
sudo chmod -R 755 /path/to/cache/directory
```

Please note that these commands should be run with caution and only if you understand what they do, as they can potentially change the permissions and ownership of many files.
