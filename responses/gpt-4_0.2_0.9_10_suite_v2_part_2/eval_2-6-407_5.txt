The error message you're seeing indicates that the JSON deserialization is failing because the response from the server is not valid JSON. The '<' character is not a valid start for a JSON document, which suggests that the server might be returning HTML or XML instead of JSON.

The issue might be related to the route you've specified in your API controller. You've specified the route as `[Route("api/Employee/Index")]` on your action method, but also `[Route("[controller]")]` on your controller. This might result in a route like `/Employee/api/Employee/Index`, which is probably not what you want.

Try changing your controller and action method to the following:

```csharp
[ApiController]
[Route("api/[controller]")]
public class EmployeeController : ControllerBase
{
    EmployeeRepository objemployee = new EmployeeRepository();

    [HttpGet]
    public IEnumerable<Employee> Index()
    {
        return objemployee.GetAllEmployees();
    }
}
```

This will result in a route like `/api/Employee` for your `Index` action method.

Then, in your Blazor code, you can call the API like this:

```csharp
empList = await Http.GetJsonAsync<Employee[]>("api/Employee");
```

If you're still having issues, you might want to check what the server is actually returning. You can do this by calling the API with a tool like Postman, or by logging the response from the server in your Blazor code before trying to deserialize it.
