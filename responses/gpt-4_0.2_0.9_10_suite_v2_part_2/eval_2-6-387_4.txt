The error message indicates that the SQLite database doesn't have a table named `Keys`. This table is required by IdentityServer4 for storing cryptographic keys.

If you are using Entity Framework Core, you can solve this problem by adding a migration and updating the database. Here are the steps:

1. Add a new migration. Open the terminal in the project directory and run the following command:

```bash
dotnet ef migrations add CreateKeysTable
```

This command creates a new migration that includes the operations necessary to create the `Keys` table.

2. Update the database. Run the following command:

```bash
dotnet ef database update
```

This command applies the new migration to the database. It creates the `Keys` table if it doesn't exist.

If you are not using Entity Framework Core, you need to manually create the `Keys` table in your SQLite database. The SQL command might look like this:

```sql
CREATE TABLE "Keys" (
    "Id" INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    "Algorithm" TEXT NOT NULL,
    "Created" TEXT NOT NULL,
    "Data" BLOB NOT NULL,
    "DataProtected" INTEGER NOT NULL,
    "IsX509Certificate" INTEGER NOT NULL,
    "Use" TEXT NOT NULL,
    "Version" INTEGER NOT NULL
);
```

Please adjust the SQL command according to your actual needs.
