Based on the error message, it seems like Doctrine is having trouble finding the migration class. The migration class name should be the fully qualified name, including the namespace. 

Since your migration is listed as `Application\Migrations\Version20210909072642`, you should use this full name when executing the migration. 

Try the following command:

```bash
bin/console --env=dev doctrine:migrations:execute 'Application\Migrations\Version20210909072642' --down --no-interaction -vvv
```

This command tells Doctrine to execute the `Version20210909072642` migration in the `Application\Migrations` namespace in the `down` direction (i.e., rollback the migration), without any interaction and with verbose output.
