There could be several reasons why you're experiencing a CSRF token mismatch error on your server while everything works fine locally. Here are some possible causes and solutions:

1. **Domain Configuration**: Ensure that your `APP_URL` in your `.env` file matches the domain you're using. If there's a mismatch, Laravel might fail to verify the CSRF token.

2. **Cookie Configuration**: Check your `config/session.php` file. The `domain` value should be set to your domain name. If it's set to `null`, Laravel will use the `APP_URL` from your `.env` file.

3. **HTTPS**: If your local environment is not using HTTPS but your production server is, this could be causing the issue. Laravel generates a secure cookie for CSRF token if the application is running over HTTPS. If your application is behind a load balancer or a reverse proxy, you should ensure that Laravel is aware of it. You can do this by trusting the proxy in your `App\Http\Middleware\TrustProxies` middleware.

4. **Session Driver**: If you're using a different session driver in production (like `memcached` or `redis`), make sure it's properly configured and working correctly.

5. **File Permissions**: Laravel needs to be able to write to the `storage/framework/sessions` directory. If the permissions are not set correctly, Laravel might not be able to store sessions.

6. **Cache**: Try clearing your application cache using `php artisan cache:clear` and `php artisan config:clear`.

7. **Browser Cookies**: The issue could be with the user's browser. Try clearing the cookies and cache in the browser.

Remember to always restart your server after making changes to your `.env` file or session configuration.
