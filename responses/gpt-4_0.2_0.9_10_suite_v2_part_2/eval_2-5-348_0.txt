The error message suggests that the command you're trying to run has a malformed argument due to an embedded quote. 

This issue can be caused by the way Windows handles command line arguments with spaces. When you have a path with spaces, you need to wrap the whole path in quotes. However, it seems like the command is not correctly handling these quotes.

Try to modify your command as follows:

```bash
cd C:\projects\open; "JAVA_HOME=C:\\Program Files\\Java\\jdk-11.0.5" cmd /c "\"C:\\Program Files\\NetBeans-11.1\\netbeans\\java\\maven\\bin\\mvn.cmd\" -DskipTests=true -Dmaven.ext.class.path=C:\\Program Files\\NetBeans-11.1\\netbeans\\java\\maven-nblib\\netbeans-eventspy.jar -Dfile.encoding=UTF-8 clean install"
```

In this version, I've removed the inner quotes around the `maven.ext.class.path` argument. This might help to avoid the issue with the embedded quote.

If the issue persists, you might want to consider reinstalling NetBeans or checking if there are any updates available that might fix this issue.
