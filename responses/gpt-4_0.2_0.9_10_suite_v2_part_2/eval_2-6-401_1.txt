You can use the factory pattern to create multiple instances of `ServiceBusClient` with different queue names. Here's an example of how you can do it:

First, create a factory interface:

```c#
public interface IServiceBusClientFactory
{
    ServiceBusSender CreateSender(string queueName);
    ServiceBusReceiver CreateReceiver(string queueName);
}
```

Then, implement the factory:

```c#
public class ServiceBusClientFactory : IServiceBusClientFactory
{
    private readonly UserEventConsumerSetting _settings;

    public ServiceBusClientFactory(IOptions<UserEventConsumerSetting> options)
    {
        _settings = options.Value;
    }

    public ServiceBusSender CreateSender(string queueName)
    {
        var client = new ServiceBusClient(_settings.ServiceBusConnectionString, new ServiceBusClientOptions
        {
            TransportType = ServiceBusTransportType.AmqpWebSockets
        });

        return client.CreateSender(queueName);
    }

    public ServiceBusReceiver CreateReceiver(string queueName)
    {
        var client = new ServiceBusClient(_settings.ServiceBusConnectionString, new ServiceBusClientOptions
        {
            TransportType = ServiceBusTransportType.AmqpWebSockets
        });

        return client.CreateReceiver(queueName, new ServiceBusReceiverOptions
        {
            ReceiveMode = ServiceBusReceiveMode.PeekLock
        });
    }
}
```

Register the factory in your DI container:

```c#
_services.AddSingleton<IServiceBusClientFactory, ServiceBusClientFactory>();
```

Now, you can inject the factory into your services and create `ServiceBusSender` or `ServiceBusReceiver` instances with different queue names:

```c#
public class CarReservationMessagingService
{
    private readonly ServiceBusSender _serviceBusSender;

    public CarReservationMessagingService(IServiceBusClientFactory factory)
    {
        _serviceBusSender = factory.CreateSender("queueName");
    }

    // ...
}
```

This way, you can create multiple `ServiceBusSender` or `ServiceBusReceiver` instances with different queue names using the same `ServiceBusClientFactory`.
