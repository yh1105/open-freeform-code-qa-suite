The error message `Unrecognized option: --add-opens` indicates that the Java version you're using doesn't recognize the `--add-opens` option. This option is used to relax the strong encapsulation of Java modules, and it's available starting from Java 9.

Hyperledger Besu requires Java 11 or later to run. Your current Java version is 1.8.0_241 (which is Java 8), and that's why it doesn't recognize the `--add-opens` option.

To solve this issue, you need to install Java 11 or a later version. Here's how you can do it:

1. Download the appropriate JDK for your operating system from the [Oracle website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html) or [AdoptOpenJDK](https://adoptopenjdk.net/).

2. Install the downloaded JDK. The installation process may vary depending on your operating system.

3. Verify the installation by opening a new terminal window and running the following command:

```shell
java -version
```

The output should indicate that you're using Java 11 or a later version.

4. If the `java -version` command still shows the old version, you may need to update your `PATH` environment variable to point to the new JDK installation.

After installing the correct Java version, you should be able to run Hyperledger Besu without encountering the `Unrecognized option: --add-opens` error.
