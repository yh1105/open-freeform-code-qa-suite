You can use the factory pattern to create multiple instances of `ServiceBusClient` with different queue names. Here's an example of how you can do it:

First, define a factory interface:

```c#
public interface IServiceBusClientFactory
{
    ServiceBusSender CreateSender(string queueName);
    ServiceBusReceiver CreateReceiver(string queueName);
}
```

Then, implement the factory:

```c#
public class ServiceBusClientFactory : IServiceBusClientFactory
{
    private readonly string _connectionString;
    private readonly ServiceBusClientOptions _options;

    public ServiceBusClientFactory(string connectionString, ServiceBusClientOptions options)
    {
        _connectionString = connectionString;
        _options = options;
    }

    public ServiceBusSender CreateSender(string queueName)
    {
        var client = new ServiceBusClient(_connectionString, _options);
        return client.CreateSender(queueName);
    }

    public ServiceBusReceiver CreateReceiver(string queueName)
    {
        var client = new ServiceBusClient(_connectionString, _options);
        return client.CreateReceiver(queueName, new ServiceBusReceiverOptions
        {
            ReceiveMode = ServiceBusReceiveMode.PeekLock
        });
    }
}
```

Register the factory in your DI container:

```c#
_services.TryAddSingleton<IServiceBusClientFactory>(implementationFactory =>
{
    var serviceBusConfiguration = implementationFactory.GetRequiredService<Microsoft.Extensions.Options.IOptions<UserEventConsumerSetting>>().Value;

    return new ServiceBusClientFactory(serviceBusConfiguration.ServiceBusConnectionString, new ServiceBusClientOptions
    {
        TransportType = ServiceBusTransportType.AmqpWebSockets
    });
});
```

Now you can inject the factory wherever you need and create `ServiceBusSender` or `ServiceBusReceiver` instances with different queue names:

```c#
public class CarReservationMessagingService
{
    private readonly IServiceBusClientFactory _factory;

    public CarReservationMessagingService(IServiceBusClientFactory factory)
    {
        _factory = factory;
    }

    public async Task PublishNewCarReservationMessageAsync(string queueName, CarReservation carReservation)
    {
        var sender = _factory.CreateSender(queueName);

        // ... rest of your code
    }
}
```

This way, you can create multiple `ServiceBusSender` or `ServiceBusReceiver` instances with the same connection string but different queue names.
