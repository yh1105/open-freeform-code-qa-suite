The error message you're seeing suggests that the `--add-opens` option is not recognized. This option is a JVM argument introduced in Java 9 to relax the strong encapsulation of Java's module system. 

Your Java version is 1.8, which does not support this option. Hyperledger Besu requires Java 11 or later to run. 

You should upgrade your Java version to at least Java 11. You can download it from the [official Oracle website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html) or use OpenJDK which is available [here](https://jdk.java.net/11/).

After installing Java 11 or later, you can verify the installation by running the following command in your terminal:

```shell
java -version
```

The output should indicate that you're running Java 11 or later. Once you have the correct Java version installed, try running the `bin\besu --help` command again.
