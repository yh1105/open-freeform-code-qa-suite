It seems like you're facing a version conflict issue. Hibernate Validator 5.x does not support `@NotEmpty` and `@NotBlank` for `String` types. These annotations are supported from Hibernate Validator 6.x onwards.

In your case, even though Maven is resolving Hibernate Validator 6.0.11, JBoss is using its own bundled Hibernate Validator 5.3.5.Final-redhat-2, which is causing the issue.

To resolve this, you can exclude the Hibernate Validator from JBoss and use the one provided by your application. You can do this by creating a `jboss-deployment-structure.xml` file in your `src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/` directory with the following content:

```xml
<jboss-deployment-structure>
    <deployment>
        <exclusions>
            <module name="org.hibernate.validator" />
        </exclusions>
    </deployment>
</jboss-deployment-structure>
```

This will tell JBoss to exclude its own Hibernate Validator module and use the one provided by your application.

Also, make sure you have the Hibernate Validator dependency in your `pom.xml`:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.hibernate.validator</groupId>
    <artifactId>hibernate-validator</artifactId>
    <version>6.0.11.Final</version>
</dependency>
```

Remember to replace `6.0.11.Final` with the version you want to use.
