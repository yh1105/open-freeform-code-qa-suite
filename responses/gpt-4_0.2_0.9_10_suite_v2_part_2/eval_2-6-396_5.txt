The error you're encountering is because you're trying to create an index on a navigation property, which is not allowed in Entity Framework. 

Indexes in Entity Framework are used to speed up the performance of data retrieval operations on a database. They can only be applied to scalar properties of an entity, not navigation properties.

To solve this problem, you should create an index on the foreign key `GenderId` instead of the navigation property `Gender`. Here's how you can do it:

```c#
protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder modelBuilder)
{
    modelBuilder.Entity<User>(user =>
    {
        user
        .HasOne(x => x.Gender)
        .WithMany(x => x.Users)
        .HasForeignKey(x => x.GenderId);

        user.HasIndex(x => x.GenderId);
    });
}
```
Now, when you run the `dotnet ef add migration User` command, it should work without any errors.
