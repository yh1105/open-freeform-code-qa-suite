The issue is that you're trying to inject `ILogger` directly, but the logging services are added as `ILogger<TCategoryName>`. You should change your class to accept `ILogger<MyClass>` instead. Here's how you can do it:

```c#
private readonly ILogger<MyClass> _logger;

public MyClass(ILogger<MyClass> logger)
{
    _logger = logger;
}

public void MyFunc()
{
    _logger.Log(LogLevel.Error, "My Message");
}
```

This way, the logger instance will be correctly resolved and injected into your class.
