The `ext-zip` is a PHP extension, not a Composer package. You can't install it via Composer. 

You need to install it via your PHP installation. The process depends on your operating system.

**For Ubuntu/Debian:**

```bash
sudo apt-get install php-zip
```

**For CentOS/RHEL:**

```bash
sudo yum install php-pecl-zip
```

**For Windows:**

1. Open your `php.ini` file.
2. Find the line `;extension=php_zip.dll`.
3. Uncomment it by removing the semicolon at the start.
4. Restart your web server.

After installing the extension, you can add it to your `composer.json` file to declare that your project depends on it:

```json
"require": {
    "php": "^7.1",
    "ext-zip": "*"
}
```

Then run `composer install` again.

If you're using Docker, you need to add the extension installation in your Dockerfile:

```Dockerfile
RUN docker-php-ext-install zip
```

Remember to rebuild your Docker image after modifying the Dockerfile.
