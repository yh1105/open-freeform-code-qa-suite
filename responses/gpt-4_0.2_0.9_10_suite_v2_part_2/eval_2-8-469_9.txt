The error message is indicating that the `go_package` option is missing in your `.proto` file. This option is used to specify the full Go package import path. 

You can fix this by adding a `go_package` option to your `.proto` file. Here's how you can do it:

```go
syntax="proto3";

package main;

option go_package = "github.com/yourusername/yourrepository"; // replace with your package's import path

message Person {
      string name = 1;
      int32 age = 2;
}
```

After adding the `go_package` option, you should be able to generate the Go code without any issues. 

Please replace `"github.com/yourusername/yourrepository"` with the actual path where you want the generated Go code to reside. 

Also, note that the `go_package` option can also be a relative path. For example, if you are generating code in the same directory as your `.proto` file, you can use `option go_package = "./";` to specify the current directory.
