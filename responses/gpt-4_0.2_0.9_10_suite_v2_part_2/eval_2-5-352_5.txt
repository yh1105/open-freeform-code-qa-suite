The issue you're experiencing is likely due to the Java version you're using. Hyperledger Besu requires Java 11 or later to run. The `--add-opens` option that is causing the error is a JVM option that was introduced in Java 9.

You're currently using Java 8 (as indicated by `java version "1.8.0_241"`), which is why it doesn't recognize the `--add-opens` option and fails to create the Java Virtual Machine.

To resolve this issue, you need to install Java 11 or a later version. Here's how you can do it:

1. Download the latest Java Development Kit (JDK) from the [official Oracle website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html) or [OpenJDK website](https://jdk.java.net/).

2. Install the JDK by following the instructions provided by the installer.

3. After installation, you need to set the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable to point to your JDK installation directory. This can be done as follows:

    - On Windows:

        1. Search for 'Environment Variables' in the Start Menu.
        2. Click on 'Edit the system environment variables'.
        3. In the System Properties window that pops up, click on 'Environment Variables'.
        4. In the Environment Variables window, click on 'New' under the 'System variables' section.
        5. Enter `JAVA_HOME` as the variable name and the path to your JDK installation as the variable value. For example, `C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-11.0.1`.
        6. Click 'OK' in all windows to apply the changes.

    - On Unix-based systems (like Linux or MacOS), add the following lines to your shell profile file (like `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`):

        ```shell
        export JAVA_HOME=/path/to/your/jdk/installation
        export PATH=$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH
        ```

        Replace `/path/to/your/jdk/installation` with the actual path to your JDK installation.

4. Verify the installation by opening a new terminal window and running `java -version`. It should display the version of the JDK you just installed.

After these steps, you should be able to run Hyperledger Besu without the previous error.
