The error message indicates that the SQLite database does not have a table named "Keys". This could be due to a few reasons:

1. The database was not updated after the upgrade. You might need to create a new migration and update the database.

2. The table "Keys" does not exist in your database. You need to create it.

Here are the steps to solve this issue:

1. **Create a new migration**

   Open your terminal and navigate to the project directory. Then, run the following command:

   ```bash
   dotnet ef migrations add UpgradeToAspNetCore6
   ```

   This command will create a new migration that includes all the changes that occurred when you upgraded to ASP.NET Core 6.0.

2. **Update the database**

   After creating the migration, you need to apply it to the database. Run the following command:

   ```bash
   dotnet ef database update
   ```

   This command will apply all pending migrations to the database, which should create the "Keys" table.

If you're still facing the issue after following these steps, you might need to check your `DbContext` and `Startup.cs` configurations to ensure everything is set up correctly. 

Also, ensure that the IdentityServer4 is correctly configured to use SQLite and the "Keys" table. You might need to check the official IdentityServer4 documentation or their GitHub page for more information.
