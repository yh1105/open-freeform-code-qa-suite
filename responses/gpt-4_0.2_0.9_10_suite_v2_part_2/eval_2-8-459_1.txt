The error message suggests that Go is unable to find the specific version of the module `github.ibm.com/kms/key-protect-client` that you're trying to use. This could be due to a few reasons:

1. **Network Issues:** There might be network issues preventing Go from accessing the module. You can try to manually clone the repository to see if this is the case.

2. **Authentication Issues:** Even though you have access to the repository, Go might not be using the correct credentials. You can try setting the `GOPRIVATE` environment variable to tell Go to use your credentials when accessing the repository. For example:

    ```bash
    export GOPRIVATE=github.ibm.com
    ```

3. **Version Issues:** The specific version of the module you're trying to use might not exist. You can check the repository to see if this is the case.

To debug this issue, you can use the `-x` flag with the `go get` command to see exactly what commands Go is running. For example:

```bash
go get -x github.ibm.com/kms/key-protect-client@v0.1.5
```

This should give you more information about what's going wrong. If you're still unable to resolve the issue, you can try deleting your `go.sum` file and re-running `go build`. Go will then re-calculate the required module versions.
