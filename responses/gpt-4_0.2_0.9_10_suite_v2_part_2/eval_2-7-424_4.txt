The error message "Failed to clear cache. Make sure you have the appropriate permissions." indicates that the user running the `php artisan cache:clear` command does not have the necessary permissions to delete the files in the cache directory.

This could be due to a few reasons:

1. The user running the command does not have write permissions on the cache directory.
2. The cache directory could be owned by a different user.
3. The cache files could be owned by a different user.

You can check the permissions and ownership of the cache directory and its files using the `ls -l` command in the terminal. If necessary, you can change the permissions using the `chmod` command and change the ownership using the `chown` command.

Remember to be careful when changing permissions and ownerships, as incorrect settings can lead to security risks. It's recommended to consult with a system administrator or a senior developer if you're unsure about these operations.
