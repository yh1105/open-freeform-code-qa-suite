## CSRF Token Mismatch Issue

The CSRF token mismatch issue could be due to a number of reasons. Here are a few things you could check:

1. **Domain Configuration**: Ensure that your domain is correctly configured. If your application is under a subdomain, make sure that the session domain is correctly set in your `config/session.php` file. If your application is under `www.example.com`, then your session domain should be `.example.com`.

2. **Cookie Settings**: Check your cookie settings. Make sure that the `SESSION_SECURE_COOKIE` in your `.env` file is set to false if you are not using HTTPS.

3. **Session Storage Permissions**: Check the permissions of your storage directory. Laravel needs to be able to write to the `storage/framework/sessions` directory. If Laravel can't write to this directory, it can't store session data, which could lead to multiple sessions being created for a single user.

4. **Middleware**: Ensure that the `VerifyCsrfToken` middleware is included in the `web` middleware group in your `app/Http/Kernel.php` file.

## Email Sending Issue

The error message you're seeing suggests that there's a problem with the SSL connection to your SMTP server. Here are a few things you could try:

1. **Encryption Type**: Try changing the `MAIL_ENCRYPTION` value in your `.env` file to `tls`. Some servers require TLS encryption instead of SSL.

2. **Port Number**: The port number you're using (587) is typically used with TLS encryption. If your server requires SSL encryption, the port number is usually 465.

3. **Firewall Settings**: Check if your server's firewall is blocking connections to the SMTP server.

4. **Server Compatibility**: Check if your SMTP server supports the version of SSL/TLS that your Laravel application is using. You might need to update your server or your Laravel application to ensure compatibility.

Remember to clear your config cache by running `php artisan config:cache` after making changes to your `.env` file.
