The error you're seeing is due to Laravel's CSRF protection. When you log out from one tab, the session is invalidated. So, when you try to log out from the other tab, the CSRF token associated with that session is no longer valid, hence the 419 error.

To handle this, you can modify your logout method to not require CSRF protection. In your `VerifyCsrfToken` middleware, you can add the logout route to the `$except` array:

```php
protected $except = [
    'logout',
];
```

Then, in your `Auth\LoginController`, you can override the `logout` method to manually logout the user:

```php
public function logout(Request $request)
{
    Auth::guard('web')->logout();

    $request->session()->invalidate();

    return redirect('/');
}
```

This way, even if the session is already invalidated, the logout action will not throw a 419 error. Instead, it will just redirect the user to the homepage.

Please note that by doing this, you're disabling CSRF protection for the logout route, which could potentially expose your application to CSRF attacks. However, since the logout action is idempotent (i.e., it has the same effect no matter how many times it's repeated), this is generally considered to be safe.
