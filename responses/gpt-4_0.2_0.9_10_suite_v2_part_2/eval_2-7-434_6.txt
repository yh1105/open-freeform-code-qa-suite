The `AbstractController::getDoctrine()` method is deprecated since Symfony 4.2. The alternative is to use dependency injection to get the Doctrine service.

Here is an example of how you can do it:

```php
use Doctrine\ORM\EntityManagerInterface;

class YourController extends AbstractController
{
    private $entityManager;

    public function __construct(EntityManagerInterface $entityManager)
    {
        $this->entityManager = $entityManager;
    }

    public function yourMethod()
    {
        // Now you can use $this->entityManager as the replacement for $this->getDoctrine()
        $repository = $this->entityManager->getRepository(YourEntity::class);
        // ...
    }
}
```

In this example, the Doctrine's `EntityManagerInterface` is injected into the controller through the constructor. This is the recommended way to access services in Symfony 4.2 and later.
