The error message is telling you that you cannot create an index on a navigation property. In Entity Framework, navigation properties are used to establish relationships between entities (like the relationship between `User` and `Gender` in your case), but they cannot be used to create an index.

Indexes in Entity Framework are used to speed up the performance of data retrieval operations on a database. They are typically created on columns that are frequently used in a WHERE clause, or columns that are used to join tables.

If you want to create an index on the `GenderId` property of the `User` entity, you should do it like this:

```csharp
protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder modelBuilder)
{
    modelBuilder.Entity<User>(user =>
    {
        user
            .HasOne(x => x.Gender)
            .WithMany(x => x.Users)
            .HasForeignKey(x => x.GenderId);

        user.HasIndex(x => x.GenderId);
    });
}
```

In this case, the index is created on the `GenderId` property, which is a foreign key in the `User` entity that establishes a relationship with the `Gender` entity. This index can help speed up queries that filter or sort data based on the `GenderId` property.
