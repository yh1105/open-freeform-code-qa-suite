The error message is indicating that you're trying to create an index on a navigation property, which is not allowed. Navigation properties are used to establish relationships between entities in Entity Framework, they are not actual database fields that you can index.

In your case, `Gender` is a navigation property in the `User` entity. If you want to create an index, it should be on a scalar property like `GenderId`.

Here is the corrected code:

```csharp
protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder modelBuilder)
{
    modelBuilder.Entity<User>(user =>
    {
        user
            .HasOne(x => x.Gender)
            .WithMany(x => x.Users)
            .HasForeignKey(x => x.GenderId);

        user.HasIndex(x => x.GenderId);
    });
}
```

In this code, the index is created on `GenderId`, which is a scalar property, not a navigation property.
