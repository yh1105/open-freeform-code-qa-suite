The error message suggests that there's a problem with the way the command is formatted. It's complaining about a "malformed argument" with an "embedded quote". 

This issue is related to the way Java 7 and later handles quotes in arguments for ProcessBuilder and similar classes. The issue is that it's not correctly escaping quotes in some cases, leading to this error.

Here's a workaround that might help:

1. Open the `mvn.cmd` file in a text editor.
2. Look for a line that starts with `set MAVEN_CMD_LINE_ARGS=`.
3. Replace that line with the following two lines:

```cmd
set "MAVEN_CMD_LINE_ARGS=%*"
set MAVEN_CMD_LINE_ARGS=%MAVEN_CMD_LINE_ARGS:"=\"%
```

This will escape the quotes in the command line arguments, which should prevent the error you're seeing.

If the problem still persists, you might want to consider downgrading to an older version of NetBeans or Java, as this issue doesn't occur in Java 6 and earlier.
