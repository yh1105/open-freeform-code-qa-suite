The error message indicates that Go is unable to find the specified version of the module `github.ibm.com/kms/key-protect-client`. This could be due to a number of reasons:

1. **Incorrect Version**: The version `v0.1.5` might not exist in the repository. You can check this by visiting the repository and ensuring that the version exists.

2. **Access Rights**: Even though you have access to the domain, you might not have access to the specific repository. You can check this by trying to clone the repository manually.

3. **Network Issues**: There might be network issues preventing Go from accessing the repository. You can check this by trying to access the repository in a web browser.

4. **Go Proxy Settings**: If you're using a Go proxy (which is the default in recent versions of Go), it might not have access to the repository. You can check this by running `go env` and looking at the `GOPROXY` value. If it's set to `https://proxy.golang.org`, you can try setting it to `direct` to bypass the proxy:

    ```bash
    go env -w GOPROXY=direct
    ```

5. **Authentication Issues**: If the repository is private, Go might not be able to authenticate. You can configure Git to use your GitHub credentials for HTTPS operations:

    ```bash
    git config --global credential.helper store
    ```

    Then, the next time you perform a Git operation that requires authentication, Git will ask for your credentials and then store them for future use.

6. **Go Version**: If you're using an older version of Go, it might not support Go modules correctly. You can check your Go version with `go version`, and if it's older than 1.11, you should upgrade.

If none of these suggestions help, you can try running `go get -v` to get more verbose output, which might give you more information about what's going wrong.
