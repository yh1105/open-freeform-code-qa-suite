The error message indicates that there is a problem with the way the command is formatted. It seems that the command is not being parsed correctly due to the presence of embedded quotes. 

In Windows, the command line interpreter cmd.exe has some peculiar rules for handling quotes. The error message suggests that these rules are not being followed correctly.

Here's a possible solution:

1. Open the `NetBeans IDE`.
2. Go to `Tools > Options > Java > Maven > Execution`.
3. In the `Global Execution Options` field, remove the quotes around the paths.

For example, change this:

```bash
-Dmaven.ext.class.path="C:\Program Files\NetBeans-11.1\netbeans\java\maven-nblib\netbeans-eventspy.jar"
```

to this:

```bash
-Dmaven.ext.class.path=C:\Program Files\NetBeans-11.1\netbeans\java\maven-nblib\netbeans-eventspy.jar
```

4. Click `OK` to save the changes.
5. Try to build the project again.

This should resolve the issue. If the problem persists, it might be a bug in NetBeans itself. In that case, you should consider updating to a newer version of NetBeans or reporting the issue to the NetBeans community.
