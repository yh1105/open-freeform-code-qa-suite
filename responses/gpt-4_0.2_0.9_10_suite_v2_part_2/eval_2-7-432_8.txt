The "419 Page Expired" error is due to Laravel's CSRF protection. When you log out from one tab, the session is invalidated. So, when you try to log out from the other tab, the CSRF token associated with that session is no longer valid, hence the error.

To handle this, you can catch the `TokenMismatchException` in your `Handler.php` file and redirect the user to the login page. Here's how you can do it:

```php
// app/Exceptions/Handler.php

use Illuminate\Session\TokenMismatchException;

public function render($request, Exception $exception)
{
    if ($exception instanceof TokenMismatchException) {
        // Redirect to a form. Here is an example of how we can
        // redirect to the login page if the user is logged out
        // during the request.
        return redirect('/login');
    }

    return parent::render($request, $exception);
}
```

This way, if a user tries to log out from a session that has already been invalidated, they will be redirected to the login page instead of seeing the "419 Page Expired" error.
