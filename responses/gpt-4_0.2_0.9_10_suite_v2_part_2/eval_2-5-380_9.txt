The issue you're facing might be due to the fact that the URL for accessing Swagger UI has been changed in newer versions of Springdoc. 

In the latest versions of Springdoc, the Swagger UI is no longer accessible via `/swagger-ui.html`. Instead, you should be able to access it via `/swagger-ui/index.html` or `/swagger-ui/`.

So, try accessing Swagger UI using the following URLs:

- `http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/`
- `http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html`

If you still face issues, make sure that the Springdoc OpenAPI UI dependency is correctly added in your `pom.xml` and the project has been properly built and run after adding the dependency.

Also, ensure that there are no conflicts with other dependencies in your project. If you have Swagger 2 dependencies in your project, you might need to remove them to avoid conflicts.
