The `Ok()` method in .NET Core Web API automatically converts the object you pass into it into JSON. So, you don't need to use `Json()` method inside `Ok()`. 

Here's how you should modify your code:

```csharp
public ActionResult IsAuthenticated()
{
    return Ok("123");
}
```

This will return a response with a 200 OK HTTP status code and a body of "123".

If you want to return a different HTTP status code, you can use the `StatusCode()` method. For example, to return a 201 Created status code, you could do:

```csharp
public ActionResult IsAuthenticated()
{
    return StatusCode(201, "123");
}
```

This will return a response with a 201 Created HTTP status code and a body of "123".
