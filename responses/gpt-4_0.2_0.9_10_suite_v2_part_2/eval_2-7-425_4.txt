You can use the `now()` function provided by Laravel to get the current date and time. Here is how you can modify your function to store the current date and time in the `created_at` and `updated_at` fields:

```php
function insert(Request $req)
{
    $name = $req->input('name');
    $address = $req->input('address');
    $data = array("name" => $name, "address" => $address, "created_at" => now(), "updated_at" => now());
    DB::table('student')->insert($data);
    echo "Record inserted successfully.<br/>";
    return redirect('/');
}
```

This will insert the current date and time into your `created_at` and `updated_at` fields. 

However, if you are using Laravel's Eloquent ORM and have these fields in your table, Laravel will automatically manage these columns for you, meaning it will automatically set their values when you create or update records. You just need to ensure that your model has the `$timestamps` property set to `true` (which is the default).
