The error message suggests that Laravel doesn't have the necessary permissions to clear the cache. This could be due to the following reasons:

1. The user running the command doesn't have the necessary permissions to modify the files in the cache directory.
2. The cache directory itself doesn't have the necessary write permissions.

You can try the following solutions:

1. Change the ownership of the project directory to the user running the command. You can do this using the `chown` command in Linux:

```bash
sudo chown -R $USER:$USER /path/to/project
```

2. Change the permissions of the cache directory to allow write operations. You can do this using the `chmod` command in Linux:

```bash
sudo chmod -R 775 /path/to/project/bootstrap/cache
```

Remember to replace `/path/to/project` with the actual path to your Laravel project.
