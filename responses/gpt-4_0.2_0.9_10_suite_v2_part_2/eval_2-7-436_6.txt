The error message you're seeing suggests that your current PHP version, PHP extensions, or Composer version may not be compatible with Laravel 9.

Here are the steps you should follow to resolve this issue:

1. **Check your PHP version**: Laravel 9 requires PHP 8.0 or higher. You can check your PHP version by running the following command in your terminal:

    ```bash
    php -v
    ```

    If your PHP version is lower than 8.0, you need to upgrade it.

2. **Check your PHP extensions**: Laravel 9 requires the following PHP extensions: BCMath, Ctype, Fileinfo, JSON, Mbstring, OpenSSL, PDO, Tokenizer, and XML. You can check your installed extensions by running:

    ```bash
    php -m
    ```

    If any of the required extensions are missing, you need to install them.

3. **Check your Composer version**: Although you've updated Composer to 2.3.10, it's worth double-checking the version. Run the following command to check:

    ```bash
    composer --version
    ```

    If your Composer version is not up-to-date, you need to update it.

4. **Try to install Laravel again**: After ensuring that your PHP version, PHP extensions, and Composer version meet the requirements, try to install Laravel 9 again:

    ```bash
    composer create-project laravel/laravel blog "9.*"
    ```

If you're still encountering issues after following these steps, please provide more information about your environment (operating system, PHP version, installed PHP extensions, Composer version) so I can provide more specific help.
