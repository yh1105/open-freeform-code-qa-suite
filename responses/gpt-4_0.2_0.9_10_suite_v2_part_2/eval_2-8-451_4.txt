Yes, you can do this with Go modules (vgo) as well. Here's an example Dockerfile that takes advantage of Docker's layer caching:

```Dockerfile
# Start from the latest golang base image
FROM golang:1.11-alpine as builder

# Add Maintainer Info
LABEL maintainer="Your Name <your-email@example.com>"

# Set the Current Working Directory inside the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy go mod and sum files 
COPY go.mod go.sum ./

# Download all dependencies. Dependencies will be cached if the go.mod and go.sum files are not changed 
RUN go mod download

# Copy the source from the current directory to the Working Directory inside the container 
COPY . .

# Build the Go app
RUN CGO_ENABLED=0 GOOS=linux go build -a -installsuffix cgo -o main .

######## Start a new stage from scratch #######
FROM alpine:latest  

RUN apk --no-cache add ca-certificates

WORKDIR /root/

# Copy the Pre-built binary file from the previous stage
COPY --from=builder /app/main .

# Expose port 8080 to the outside world
EXPOSE 8080

#Command to run the executable
CMD ["./main"] 
```

In this Dockerfile, the `go.mod` and `go.sum` files are copied over and `go mod download` is run. This will download all the dependencies specified in `go.mod` and `go.sum`. Then, the rest of the source code is copied over and the application is built. If the `go.mod` and `go.sum` files don't change, Docker will use the cached layer from the previous `go mod download` command, speeding up the build process.
