The error message you're seeing is typically caused by an HTTP request that is not returning valid JSON. The '<' character at the start of the response suggests that you might be getting an HTML error page instead.

Here are a few things you can try to resolve the issue:

1. **Check the URL**: Make sure the URL you're using in your Blazor app matches the route defined in your API controller. In your case, the URL should be "/api/Employee/Index".

2. **Check the HTTP response**: Use a tool like Postman or Fiddler to manually send a request to your API and see what it returns. If it's returning an HTML error page, this will help you figure out what the error is.

3. **Use `GetFromJsonAsync` instead of `GetJsonAsync`**: In .NET 5.0 and later, the `GetJsonAsync` method is obsolete. You should use `GetFromJsonAsync` instead. Here's how you can modify your code:

```csharp
empList = await Http.GetFromJsonAsync<Employee[]>("/api/Employee/Index");
```

4. **Catch exceptions**: Modify your code to catch any exceptions that occur when making the HTTP request. This can help you understand what's going wrong:

```csharp
try
{
    empList = await Http.GetFromJsonAsync<Employee[]>("/api/Employee/Index");
}
catch (Exception ex)
{
    Console.WriteLine(ex.Message);
}
```

5. **Check your API controller**: Make sure your API controller is correctly set up and returning the expected data. You can test this by adding a breakpoint in your `Index` method and debugging your API.

Remember to replace `Http.GetJsonAsync` with `Http.GetFromJsonAsync` in your Blazor code, as `GetJsonAsync` is now obsolete.
