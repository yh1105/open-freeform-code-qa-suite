Sure, here is the `ClientInfo` struct that you can use for serialization:

```go
type ClientInfo struct {
	Hostname string `json:"Hostname"`
	IP       string `json:"IP"`
	MacAddr  string `json:"MacAddr"`
}

type Clients struct {
	Clients []ClientInfo `json:"Clients"`
}
```

In this code, `ClientInfo` is a struct that represents a single client with fields `Hostname`, `IP`, and `MacAddr`. The `json` tags are used to map the JSON keys to the struct fields. 

The `Clients` struct is a wrapper that represents the array of `ClientInfo` objects in your JSON. The `Clients` field is a slice of `ClientInfo` structs.
