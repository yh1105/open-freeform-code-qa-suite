The error message "Failed to clear cache. Make sure you have the appropriate permissions." suggests that the user running the `php artisan cache:clear` command doesn't have the necessary permissions to delete the files in the cache directory.

This could be due to a few reasons:

1. The user running the command doesn't own the files in the cache directory.
2. The user running the command doesn't have write permissions on the cache directory.
3. The cache directory or files within it are read-only.

You can check the owner and permissions of the cache directory by running `ls -l` in the parent directory of the cache directory. If the user running the command is not the owner, you can change the owner using `chown`. If the user doesn't have write permissions, you can change the permissions using `chmod`.

Please note that you should be careful when changing ownership and permissions of directories and files, as it can potentially make your system less secure.
