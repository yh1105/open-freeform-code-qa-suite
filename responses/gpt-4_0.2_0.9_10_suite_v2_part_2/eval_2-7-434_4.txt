The `AbstractController::getDoctrine()` method is deprecated since Symfony 4.2, and it will be removed in Symfony 5.0.

The new alternative is to inject the `Doctrine` service into your controller methods. You can do this by type-hinting the `Doctrine` service in your controller method and Symfony will automatically inject it for you.

Here is an example:

```php
use Doctrine\ORM\EntityManagerInterface;
//...

public function myMethod(EntityManagerInterface $entityManager)
{
    // You can now use the $entityManager object
    //...
}
```

In this example, `EntityManagerInterface` is the Doctrine's entity manager. Symfony will automatically provide it when the method is called.

This change is part of a broader strategy in Symfony to promote dependency injection and make services explicit.
