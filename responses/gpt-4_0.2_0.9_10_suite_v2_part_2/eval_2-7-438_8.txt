The error message indicates that the migration class "20210909072642" was not found. This could be due to the incorrect namespace or the class name provided in the command.

Based on your configuration and the migration class listed, you should use the full namespace of the migration class in the command. 

So, the correct command to execute the migration should be:

```bash
bin/console --env=dev doctrine:migrations:execute 'Application\Migrations\Version20210909072642' --down --no-interaction -vvv
```

Make sure that the migration class `Version20210909072642` exists in the `app/DoctrineMigrations` directory and its namespace is `Application\Migrations`. If the class or namespace is different, you should adjust the command accordingly.
