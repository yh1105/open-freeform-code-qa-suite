The `dd()` function in Laravel is a helper function that is used to dump a variable's contents to the browser and halt further script execution. However, it has a limitation when it comes to handling large amounts of data, especially with deeply nested arrays or objects.

To overcome this limitation, you can use the following alternatives:

1. **Laravel Debugbar**: This is a package that can be used to add a debug bar to your application. It can handle large amounts of data and can display them in a more readable format. You can install it via composer:

```bash
composer require barryvdh/laravel-debugbar --dev
```

After installing, you can use the `Debugbar::info($yourVariable);` to dump your variable.

2. **Log Files**: You can write your debug data to log files. This is especially useful when dealing with large amounts of data. You can use Laravel's logging facilities to achieve this:

```php
\Log::info(print_r($yourVariable, true));
```

This will write the contents of `$yourVariable` to your log file, which you can view at your leisure.

3. **VarDumper Component**: Laravel's `dd()` function uses the Symfony VarDumper component. You can use this component directly and it might give you a bit more flexibility. You can use it like this:

```php
dump($yourVariable);

// or

\Symfony\Component\VarDumper\VarDumper::dump($yourVariable);
```

Remember, if you're dealing with large collections, you might want to use the `take` or `limit` methods to reduce the number of results you're dealing with.
