In a .NET 6 console application, you don't have the `WebApplication` class available. Instead, you can use the `ConfigurationBuilder` to read the `appsettings.json` file.

Here's an example of how you can do it:

```csharp
using Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration;
using System;
using System.IO;

class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        var builder = new ConfigurationBuilder()
            .SetBasePath(Directory.GetCurrentDirectory())
            .AddJsonFile("appsettings.json", optional: true, reloadOnChange: true);

        IConfigurationRoot configuration = builder.Build();

        // Now you can use configuration.GetSection or configuration.GetValue to read your settings
        var mySetting = configuration.GetSection("MySetting").Value;
        Console.WriteLine(mySetting);
    }
}
```

In this example, `appsettings.json` should be in the same directory as your executable. If it's not, you should adjust the path accordingly.

Also, don't forget to set the `Copy to Output Directory` property of your `appsettings.json` file to `Copy if newer` or `Copy always` in the file properties in Visual Studio, so the file is copied to the output directory during the build.
