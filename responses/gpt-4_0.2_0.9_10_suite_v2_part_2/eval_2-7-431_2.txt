The `dd()` function in Laravel is a helper function that is used to dump a variable's contents to the browser and halt further script execution. However, it has a limitation when it comes to displaying large amounts of data, especially with deeply nested arrays or objects.

To overcome this limitation, you can use the following methods:

1. **Use `var_dump()` or `print_r()` instead of `dd()`:**

```php
var_dump($yourVariable);
```
or

```php
print_r($yourVariable);
```

2. **Use `toArray()` or `toJson()` method:**

If you are dealing with Eloquent collections or models, you can use `toArray()` or `toJson()` methods to convert them into an array or JSON format.

```php
dd($yourVariable->toArray());
```
or

```php
dd($yourVariable->toJson());
```

3. **Use `xdebug` extension:**

If you are using Xdebug, you can increase the `max_nesting_level` in your `php.ini` file.

```ini
xdebug.var_display_max_depth = 10
```

4. **Use Laravel Debugbar or Telescope:**

These are Laravel packages that provide a debugger bar in your application. They are very useful for debugging queries, views, route names, etc. You can install them via composer.

For Laravel Debugbar:

```bash
composer require barryvdh/laravel-debugbar --dev
```

For Laravel Telescope:

```bash
composer require laravel/telescope
```

Remember, these are development tools and should not be used in a production environment.

5. **Use Log Files:**

You can write the output to the log file and then view it.

```php
\Log::info(print_r($yourVariable, true));
```

Then you can view the log file in `storage/logs/laravel.log`.

Remember, always be careful when dumping and dying (`dd()`) with large data sets, as it can consume a lot of memory and may lead to a script failure.
