The error message "invalid source release: 17" indicates that Gradle is not using Java 17 to compile your project. This is likely because the Gradle JVM is not set to Java 17.

To resolve this issue, you need to set the Gradle JVM to Java 17. Here's how you can do it:

1. Go to "File" -> "Settings" (On Mac, "IntelliJ IDEA" -> "Preferences").
2. In the Settings/Preferences dialog, go to "Build, Execution, Deployment" -> "Build Tools" -> "Gradle".
3. Under the "Gradle JVM" option, select your Java 17 SDK. If it's not in the list, you can add it by selecting "Add JDK..." from the dropdown menu.
4. Click "OK" to save the changes.

After doing this, try to rebuild your project. If everything is set up correctly, your project should now compile and run without the "invalid source release: 17" error.

If the problem persists, you can try invalidating caches and restarting IntelliJ IDEA. Go to "File" -> "Invalidate Caches / Restart..." -> "Invalidate and Restart". This will clear the internal cache of the IDE and might resolve the issue.

Also, make sure that you have the latest version of Gradle that supports Java 17. You can update Gradle by changing the version in your `gradle-wrapper.properties` file or by using a Gradle wrapper.
