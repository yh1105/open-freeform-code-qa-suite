The `dd()` function in Laravel is a helper function that stands for "dump and die". It's used to dump a variable's contents to the browser and stop further script execution. However, it has limitations when dealing with large amounts of data or deeply nested arrays/objects.

If you're dealing with large amounts of data, you might run into memory issues or the output might be truncated. Here are a few ways to handle this:

1. **Increase PHP's memory limit**: You can increase PHP's memory limit in your `php.ini` file. This might allow `dd()` to handle larger data sets. However, be careful not to set the limit too high, as it could lead to other issues.

    ```ini
    memory_limit = 512M
    ```

2. **Use pagination**: If you're dealing with a lot of data from a database, consider using Laravel's built-in pagination to limit the number of results returned at once.

    ```php
    $users = DB::table('users')->paginate(15);
    ```

3. **Limit the output**: Instead of dumping all data, you can limit the output to specific parts of the array or object.

    ```php
    dd($array['key']);
    ```

4. **Use `dump()` instead of `dd()`**: The `dump()` function works similarly to `dd()`, but it doesn't stop the script execution. This might allow you to view more data.

5. **Use Xdebug**: Xdebug is a PHP extension that provides debugging and profiling capabilities. It can handle larger data sets and provides a more user-friendly output than `dd()`.

6. **Use Laravel Telescope**: Laravel Telescope is an elegant debug assistant for the Laravel framework. It provides insight into the requests coming into your application, exceptions, log entries, database queries, queued jobs, mail, notifications, cache operations, scheduled tasks, variable dumps and more.

Remember, `dd()` and similar functions should only be used for debugging. They should not be used in production code.
