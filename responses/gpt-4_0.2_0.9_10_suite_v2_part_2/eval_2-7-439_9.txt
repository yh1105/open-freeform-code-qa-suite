The `ext-zip` is a reference to the ZIP PHP extension. This is not a Composer package, so you cannot install it using `composer require`.

If you're using a Unix-like operating system, you can install it via the terminal:

```bash
sudo apt-get install php-zip
```

If you're using Windows, you'll need to enable it in your `php.ini` file:

1. Open your `php.ini` file.
2. Search for the line `;extension=zip`.
3. Uncomment it by removing the semicolon (`;`) at the start of the line.
4. Save your `php.ini` file.
5. Restart your web server.

After installing or enabling the ZIP extension, you can add it to your `composer.json` file manually:

```json
{
    "require": {
        "php": "^7.1.3",
        "ext-zip": "*"
    }
}
```

Then run `composer update`.

Remember to replace `"php": "^7.1.3"` with your actual PHP version.
