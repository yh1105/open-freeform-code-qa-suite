The `ext-zip` is a PHP extension, not a Composer package. This means that it should be installed in your PHP environment, not through Composer.

If you are using a Unix-like operating system, you can install it via `pecl` or `apt-get` (for Debian-based systems) or `yum` (for RedHat-based systems).

For Debian-based systems like Ubuntu, you can use:

```bash
sudo apt-get install php-zip
```

For RedHat-based systems like CentOS, you can use:

```bash
sudo yum install php-zip
```

If you are using Windows, you can enable it in your `php.ini` file by uncommenting or adding the line:

```ini
extension=php_zip.dll
```

After installing or enabling the extension, don't forget to restart your web server to apply the changes.

In your `composer.json` file, you can specify that your project requires this extension using:

```json
{
    "require": {
        "php": "^7.1",
        "ext-zip": "*"
    }
}
```

This won't install the extension, but it will prevent `composer install` from succeeding if the extension is not present in the environment.
