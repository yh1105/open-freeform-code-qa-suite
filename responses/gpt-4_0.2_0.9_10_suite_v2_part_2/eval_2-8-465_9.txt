The `ext-zip` is a PHP extension, not a Composer package. It's used to handle ZIP archives in PHP. The error message you're seeing is because Composer is trying to find a package named `ext-zip`, but it doesn't exist.

If you're using a Unix-like operating system (like Ubuntu), you can install the `ext-zip` extension with the following command:

```bash
sudo apt-get install php-zip
```

If you're using Windows, you can enable the extension by editing your `php.ini` file. Uncomment (or add) the line:

```ini
extension=php_zip.dll
```

Then, restart your web server.

After installing or enabling the `ext-zip` extension, you can tell Composer that it's installed by adding it to the `require` section of your `composer.json` file:

```json
{
    "require": {
        "php": "^7.1.3",
        "ext-zip": "*"
    }
}
```

Then, run `composer update` to update your project's dependencies.

If you're still having trouble, you might need to specify the version of `ext-zip` that your project requires. You can find out which version you have installed by running `php -m` and looking for `zip` in the list of modules.
