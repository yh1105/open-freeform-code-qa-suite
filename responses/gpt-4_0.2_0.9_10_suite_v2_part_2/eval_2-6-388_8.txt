The `[Keyless]` attribute is not part of the `System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations` namespace. It's actually part of the `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore` namespace. 

This attribute was introduced in Entity Framework Core 5.0. If you're using a version prior to 5.0, you won't have access to this attribute. 

To use the `[Keyless]` attribute, you need to:

1. Make sure you're using Entity Framework Core 5.0 or later.
2. Add the `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore` namespace to your file.

Here's how you can do it:

```csharp
using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore;

[Keyless]
public class MyKeylessClass
{
    // ...
}
```

If you're using a version prior to 5.0, you can use the `.HasNoKey()` method in your `DbContext`:

```csharp
public class MyDbContext : DbContext
{
    public DbSet<MyKeylessClass> KeylessModel { get; set; }

    protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder modelBuilder)
    {
        modelBuilder.Entity<MyKeylessClass>().HasNoKey();
    }
}
```

This will achieve the same result as the `[Keyless]` attribute.
