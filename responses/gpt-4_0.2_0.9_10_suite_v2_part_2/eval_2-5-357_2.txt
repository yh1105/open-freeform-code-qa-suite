The `@Autowired` annotation was required in older versions of Spring to indicate that a constructor should be used for autowiring. However, since Spring 4.3, if a class has only one constructor, Spring will use that constructor for autowiring even if it's not annotated with `@Autowired`.

People might still use `@Autowired` on constructors out of habit, or to make it explicit that the constructor is being used for autowiring. It's also possible that they're working in a codebase that needs to be compatible with older versions of Spring.

In summary, if you're using Spring 4.3 or later and your class has only one constructor, you don't need to use `@Autowired` on that constructor for autowiring to work.
