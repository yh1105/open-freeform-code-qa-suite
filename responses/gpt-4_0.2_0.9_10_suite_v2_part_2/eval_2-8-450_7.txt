Sure, here is the `ClientInfo` struct that you can use for serialization:

```go
type ClientInfo struct {
	Hostname string `json:"Hostname"`
	IP       string `json:"IP"`
	MacAddr  string `json:"MacAddr"`
}

type Clients struct {
	Clients []ClientInfo `json:"Clients"`
}
```

In this code, `ClientInfo` is a struct that represents a single client, with `Hostname`, `IP`, and `MacAddr` as its fields. The `Clients` struct is a wrapper that contains a slice of `ClientInfo` objects. The `json` tags are used to specify the key names in the JSON object.
