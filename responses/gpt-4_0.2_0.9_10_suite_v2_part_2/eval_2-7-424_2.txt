The error message "Failed to clear cache. Make sure you have the appropriate permissions." suggests that the user running the `php artisan cache:clear` command doesn't have the necessary permissions to delete files in the cache directory.

This could be due to a few reasons:

1. The user that is running the command doesn't have write permissions to the cache directory.
2. The cache directory could be owned by a different user.
3. The cache files could be owned by a different user.

You can check the permissions and ownership of the cache directory and its files with the `ls -l` command in the terminal. If the permissions or ownership are incorrect, you can change them with the `chmod` and `chown` commands respectively.

For example, if your cache directory is owned by the `www-data` user and your user is `homestead`, you can change the ownership with:

```bash
sudo chown -R homestead:homestead /path/to/cache/directory
```

And you can change the permissions with:

```bash
sudo chmod -R 755 /path/to/cache/directory
```

Remember to replace `/path/to/cache/directory` with the actual path to your cache directory.
