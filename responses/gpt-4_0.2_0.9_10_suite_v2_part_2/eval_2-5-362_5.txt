The error message you're seeing is due to the fact that Spring Cloud 2020.0.2 (aka Ilford) has introduced a new way of loading configuration data through the `spring.config.import` property. This property is used to import configuration data from Config Server or other sources.

However, since you're not using Config Server in your project, you can disable this feature by excluding `ConfigDataImportSelector` from your test configuration.

Here is how you can do it:

```java
@SpringBootTest(
    webEnvironment = WebEnvironment.RANDOM_PORT,
    classes = {
        ProductCompositeServiceApplication.class,
        TestSecurityConfig.class },
    properties = {
        "spring.main.allow-bean-definition-overriding=true" },
    excludeAutoConfiguration = ConfigDataImportSelector.class)
```

This should solve your problem.

Alternatively, you can also disable the Config Server bootstrap configuration by setting the `spring.cloud.config.enabled` property to `false` in your `application.properties` or `application.yml` file:

```properties
spring.cloud.config.enabled=false
```

Or in your test configuration:

```java
@SpringBootTest(
    webEnvironment = WebEnvironment.RANDOM_PORT,
    classes = {
        ProductCompositeServiceApplication.class,
        TestSecurityConfig.class },
    properties = {
        "spring.main.allow-bean-definition-overriding=true",
        "spring.cloud.config.enabled=false" })
```
