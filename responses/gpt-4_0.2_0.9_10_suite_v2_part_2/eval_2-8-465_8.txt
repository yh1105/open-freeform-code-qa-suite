The `ext-zip` is a PHP extension, not a Composer package. The `composer require ext-zip` command is not used to install PHP extensions, but to add them as a requirement to your project.

To install the `ext-zip` extension, you need to install it via your PHP installation. 

If you are using a Unix-like operating system, you can install it via `pecl` or `apt-get` (for Debian-based systems) or `yum` (for RedHat-based systems).

For Debian-based systems like Ubuntu, you can use:

```bash
sudo apt-get install php-zip
```

For RedHat-based systems like CentOS, you can use:

```bash
sudo yum install php-pecl-zip
```

If you are using Windows, you can enable it in your `php.ini` file by uncommenting or adding the line:

```ini
extension=php_zip.dll
```

After installing or enabling the extension, don't forget to restart your web server.

Then, in your `composer.json` file, you can add `ext-zip` as a platform requirement:

```json
"require": {
    "php": "^7.1.3",
    "ext-zip": "*",
    // ...
},
```

This won't install the extension, but it will prevent `composer install` from succeeding if the extension is not present in the system.
