The `[Keyless]` attribute is not part of the `System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations` namespace. It is part of the `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore` namespace.

To use the `[Keyless]` attribute, you need to install the `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Relational` package and add the following using directive at the top of your file:

```csharp
using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore;
```

Then, you can use the `[Keyless]` attribute in your model class like this:

```csharp
[Keyless]
public class MyKeylessClass
{
    // ...
}
```

Remember to add the `DbSet` for your keyless class in your `DbContext`:

```csharp
public DbSet<MyKeylessClass> KeylessModel { get; set; }
```

And then you can use it like this:

```csharp
_context.KeylessModel.FromSqlRaw(...)
```

Make sure that your project is using a version of Entity Framework Core that supports the `[Keyless]` attribute. This attribute was introduced in EF Core 5.0. If you're using an older version, you might not have access to this attribute.
