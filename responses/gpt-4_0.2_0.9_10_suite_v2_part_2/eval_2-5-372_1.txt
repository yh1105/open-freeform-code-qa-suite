This issue is likely due to a version conflict between Hibernate Validator versions. The error message indicates that Hibernate Validator 5.3.5.Final-redhat-2 is being used, but the `@NotEmpty` and `@NotBlank` annotations are not supported until Hibernate Validator 6.0.0.Final.

Spring Boot 2.0.4.RELEASE should already include Hibernate Validator 6.0.7.Final, but it seems that your JBoss server is using its own bundled version (5.3.5.Final-redhat-2) instead.

To solve this issue, you can try one of the following options:

1. **Upgrade your JBoss server to a version that uses Hibernate Validator 6.0.0.Final or later.** This is the most straightforward solution if you have control over the server and can upgrade it.

2. **Exclude the Hibernate Validator from the JBoss modules.** You can do this by creating a `jboss-deployment-structure.xml` file in your `WEB-INF` directory with the following content:

```xml
<jboss-deployment-structure>
    <deployment>
        <exclusions>
            <module name="org.hibernate.validator" />
        </exclusions>
    </deployment>
</jboss-deployment-structure>
```

This tells JBoss to exclude its own Hibernate Validator module, and it should then use the version provided by your application.

3. **Include Hibernate Validator 6.0.0.Final or later in your application.** You can do this by adding the following dependency to your `pom.xml`:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.hibernate.validator</groupId>
    <artifactId>hibernate-validator</artifactId>
    <version>6.0.11.Final</version>
</dependency>
```

This will include the correct version of Hibernate Validator in your application, but it may not work if JBoss still prefers its own version. In that case, you would need to use one of the other solutions.
