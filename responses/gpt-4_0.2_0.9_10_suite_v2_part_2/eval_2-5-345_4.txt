This error is caused by a compatibility issue between IntelliJ IDEA and the Maven version (3.8.5) that comes with Spring Boot 2.7. 

The error message indicates that IntelliJ IDEA is trying to use a method in the `org.apache.maven.model.validation.DefaultModelValidator` class that doesn't exist in the version of Maven you're using. 

To resolve this issue, you can try the following steps:

1. **Update IntelliJ IDEA**: Make sure you are using the latest version of IntelliJ IDEA. JetBrains regularly releases updates to ensure compatibility with the latest versions of tools like Maven.

2. **Downgrade Maven version**: If updating IntelliJ IDEA doesn't work, you can try downgrading the Maven version in your project to a version that is compatible with your version of IntelliJ IDEA. 

To downgrade the Maven version, you can modify the `pom.xml` file in your project:

```xml
<properties>
    <maven.version>3.8.1</maven.version>
</properties>
```

3. **Update Maven in IntelliJ IDEA**: You can also try updating the bundled Maven version in IntelliJ IDEA. To do this, go to `File -> Settings -> Build, Execution, Deployment -> Build Tools -> Maven` and update the `Maven home directory` to point to a newer version of Maven.

Remember to restart IntelliJ IDEA after making these changes to ensure they take effect.
