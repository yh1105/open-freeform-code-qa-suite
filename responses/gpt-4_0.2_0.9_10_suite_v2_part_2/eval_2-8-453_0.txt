The `err113` linter rule is suggesting that you should not define dynamic errors using `errors.New()` directly in your code. Instead, you should define a static error and use that, possibly wrapping it with additional context if needed.

The reason for this is that comparing error strings is generally not a good practice. If you have a static error, you can compare errors directly with `errors.Is()`, which is a more reliable method.

Here's how you can fix your code:

First, define your errors at the package level:

```go
var (
    ErrRepo = errors.New("repo gave err")
    ErrOops = errors.New("oops")
)
```

Then, use these errors in your code:

```go
foo_test.go:55:61: err113: do not define dynamic errors, use wrapped static errors instead: "errors.New(\"repo gave err\")" (goerr113)
        repoMock.EXPECT().Save(gomock.Eq(&foooBarBar)).Return(nil, ErrRepo),
                                                                  ^

foo_test.go:22:42: err113: do not define dynamic errors, use wrapped static errors instead: "errors.New(\"oops\")" (goerr113)
    repoMock.EXPECT().FindAll().Return(nil, ErrOops)
```

This way, you're using static errors instead of dynamic ones, and the linter should stop complaining.
