The error message you're seeing is related to the SSL version being used to establish a connection with the SMTP server. The error `ssl3_get_record:wrong version number` suggests that the client and server are unable to agree on a common SSL version to use for the connection.

Here are a few things you can try to resolve this issue:

1. **Change the MAIL_ENCRYPTION setting:** In your `.env` file, you have `MAIL_ENCRYPTION=ssl`. Try changing this to `MAIL_ENCRYPTION=tls`. TLS is the successor to SSL and is more secure. Many servers now require TLS for secure connections.

2. **Check the port number:** The standard port for SSL connections is 465, and for TLS it's 587. If you're using SSL, try changing `MAIL_PORT=587` to `MAIL_PORT=465` in your `.env` file.

3. **Contact the email service provider:** If the above solutions don't work, it's possible that there's a configuration issue on the server side. You may need to contact the email service provider (in this case, propnex.sg) for assistance.

Remember to clear the config cache after making changes to your `.env` file. You can do this by running `php artisan config:cache` in your Laravel project directory.

Also, ensure that your server has the necessary OpenSSL libraries installed and that PHP's `openssl` extension is enabled. You can check this by creating a PHP file with `phpinfo();` and looking for the 'openssl' section.
