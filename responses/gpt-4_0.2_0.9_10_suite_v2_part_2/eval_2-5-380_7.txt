The issue you're experiencing might be due to the fact that the URL for Swagger UI has been updated in recent versions of the Springdoc OpenAPI UI library.

In the newer versions of Springdoc OpenAPI UI, the Swagger UI is no longer available at `/swagger-ui.html`. Instead, it's available at `/swagger-ui/index.html` or simply `/swagger-ui/`.

So, try accessing Swagger UI at:

```
http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/
```

or

```
http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html
```

If you still can't access Swagger UI, make sure that you have the necessary configuration in place. For example, you might need to add a `@Configuration` class to set up Springdoc OpenAPI. Here's a basic example:

```java
@Configuration
public class OpenApiConfiguration {

    @Bean
    public OpenAPI customOpenAPI() {
        return new OpenAPI()
                .info(new Info()
                        .title("My API")
                        .version("1.0")
                        .description("This is a sample Spring Boot RESTful service using springdoc-openapi and OpenAPI 3."));
    }
}
```

Also, make sure that your Spring Boot application is running and that there are no errors in the logs.
