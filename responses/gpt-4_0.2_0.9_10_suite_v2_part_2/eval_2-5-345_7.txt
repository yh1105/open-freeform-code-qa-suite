This error is related to the compatibility issue between IntelliJ IDEA and the Maven version used in your project. The error message indicates that IntelliJ IDEA is trying to use a method in `org.apache.maven.model.validation.DefaultModelValidator` that doesn't exist in the version of Maven used in your project.

Here are some possible solutions:

1. **Update IntelliJ IDEA:** Make sure you are using the latest version of IntelliJ IDEA. JetBrains regularly releases updates to ensure compatibility with the latest versions of build tools like Maven.

2. **Downgrade Maven version in your project:** If updating IntelliJ IDEA is not an option or doesn't solve the issue, you can try to downgrade the Maven version in your project to a version that is compatible with your IntelliJ IDEA version.

3. **Update Maven bundled in IntelliJ IDEA:** IntelliJ IDEA comes with a bundled version of Maven. You can try updating this bundled version to match the Maven version used in your project. To do this, go to `File -> Settings -> Build, Execution, Deployment -> Build Tools -> Maven`. Under `Maven home directory`, select the directory of the Maven version you want to use.

4. **Invalidating IntelliJ IDEA caches:** Sometimes, IntelliJ IDEA caches can cause issues. You can try invalidating these caches by going to `File -> Invalidate Caches / Restart...`.

Remember to always backup your project before making any changes to your build tools or IDE settings.
