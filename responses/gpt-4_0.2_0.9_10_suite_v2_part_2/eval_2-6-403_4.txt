In your code, you are using the `Json` method inside the `Ok` method, which is unnecessary and causing the unexpected output. The `Ok` method already returns a status code of 200 and formats the response as JSON.

Here's how you can modify your method to return a JSON response with a HTTP status code:

```csharp
public ActionResult IsAuthenticated()
{
    return Ok("123");
}
```

This will return a HTTP 200 status code with a response body of `"123"`.

If you want to return a different status code, you can use the `StatusCode` method:

```csharp
public ActionResult IsAuthenticated()
{
    return StatusCode(201, "123");
}
```

This will return a HTTP 201 status code with a response body of `"123"`.

If you want to return a complex object as JSON, you can just pass the object to the `Ok` or `StatusCode` method:

```csharp
public ActionResult IsAuthenticated()
{
    var data = new { Id = 123, Name = "Test" };
    return Ok(data);
}
```

This will return a HTTP 200 status code with a JSON response body of `{"Id":123,"Name":"Test"}`.
