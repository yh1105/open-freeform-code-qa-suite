The error message indicates that the migration class was not found. This could be due to the incorrect namespace or the wrong migration version number.

Based on your configuration and the migration class name, you should use the following command:

```bash
bin/console --env=dev doctrine:migrations:execute 'Application\Migrations\Version20210909072642' --down --no-interaction -vvv
```

This command includes the correct namespace (`Application\Migrations`) and the version number (`Version20210909072642`) of the migration.

If you still encounter the same error, make sure that the migration class `Version20210909072642` actually exists in the directory `app/DoctrineMigrations`. The file name should be `Version20210909072642.php` and the class inside this file should be named `Version20210909072642`.
