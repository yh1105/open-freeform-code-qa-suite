Sure, here is the `ClientInfo` struct that you can use for serialization:

```go
type ClientInfo struct {
	Hostname string `json:"Hostname"`
	IP       string `json:"IP"`
	MacAddr  string `json:"MacAddr"`
}

type Clients struct {
	Clients []ClientInfo `json:"Clients"`
}
```

In this code, `ClientInfo` is a struct that represents a single client, and `Clients` is a struct that contains a slice of `ClientInfo`. The `json` tags are used to map the JSON keys to the struct fields.
