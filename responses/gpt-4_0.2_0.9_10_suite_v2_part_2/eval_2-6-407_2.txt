The error message you're seeing is due to the fact that the server is returning HTML instead of JSON. The '<' character is the start of an HTML tag, which is not valid JSON.

The issue is likely due to the route configuration in your API controller. You have defined the route as `api/Employee/Index` in your `HttpGet` attribute, but you also have `[Route("[controller]")]` at the controller level. This means that the actual route to your `Index` method is `/Employee/api/Employee/Index`.

To fix this, you should change your `HttpGet` attribute to just `[HttpGet]` and your route at the controller level to `[Route("api/[controller]")]`. This way, the route to your `Index` method will be `/api/Employee`.

Here's how your controller should look:

```csharp
[ApiController]
[Route("api/[controller]")]
public class EmployeeController : ControllerBase
{
    EmployeeRepository objemployee = new EmployeeRepository();

    [HttpGet]
    public IEnumerable<Employee> Index()
    {
        return objemployee.GetAllEmployees();
    }
}
```

And then in your Blazor code, you should be able to call the API like this:

```csharp
empList = await Http.GetJsonAsync<Employee[]>("/api/Employee");
```

This should solve your problem. If you're still having issues, please let me know.
