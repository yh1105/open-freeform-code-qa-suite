There could be several reasons why you're experiencing a CSRF token mismatch error on your production server. Here are a few things you could check:

1. **Domain Configuration**: Check if your application's domain is correctly set in the `.env` file. The `APP_URL` should match the domain you're using. If it's not set correctly, Laravel might not be able to match the session with the user.

2. **Cookie Domain**: If your application is under a subdomain, you might need to set the `SESSION_DOMAIN` in your `.env` file to your root domain. For example, if your application is hosted at `app.example.com`, you should set `SESSION_DOMAIN=.example.com`.

3. **Secure Cookies**: If your application is running over HTTP but you have `SESSION_SECURE_COOKIE=true` in your `.env` file, Laravel will only send the cookie over HTTPS, and thus the session won't be set correctly. Either switch to HTTPS (which is recommended) or set `SESSION_SECURE_COOKIE=false`.

4. **Session Files Permissions**: Check the permissions of the `storage/framework/sessions` directory. Laravel needs to be able to read and write in this directory to manage sessions. The correct permissions would typically be `755` for directories and `644` for files.

5. **Session Driver**: If you're using a session driver other than `file`, such as `database` or `redis`, make sure the server is correctly configured for that driver.

6. **Middleware**: Ensure that the `VerifyCsrfToken` middleware is included in the `web` middleware group in your `app/Http/Kernel.php` file.

7. **Cache Configuration**: Try clearing the configuration cache using `php artisan config:clear`.

8. **Session Data Serialization**: If you're storing complex data types (like objects or closures) in the session, serialization issues could cause problems. Try to stick to simple data types like strings, integers, and arrays.

Remember to always clear your configuration cache (`php artisan config:cache`) after making changes to your `.env` file or configuration files.
