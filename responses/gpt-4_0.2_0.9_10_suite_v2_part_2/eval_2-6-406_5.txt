In a .NET 6 console application, you don't have the `WebApplication` class available. You can use the `ConfigurationBuilder` class to read the `appsettings.json` file.

Here is an example:

```csharp
using Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration;

var builder = new ConfigurationBuilder()
    .SetBasePath(Directory.GetCurrentDirectory())
    .AddJsonFile("appsettings.json", optional: false, reloadOnChange: true);

IConfiguration configuration = builder.Build();
```

This will load the `appsettings.json` file from the current directory. If the file is not found, an exception will be thrown (`optional: false`). If the file changes, the configuration will be reloaded (`reloadOnChange: true`).

You can then access your settings like this:

```csharp
string mySetting = configuration["MySetting"];
```

Don't forget to add the necessary NuGet packages (`Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration`, `Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.Json`, `Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.FileExtensions`) and using directives if they are not already present in your project.
