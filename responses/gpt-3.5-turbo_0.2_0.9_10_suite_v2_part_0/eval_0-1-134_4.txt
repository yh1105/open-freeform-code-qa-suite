It sounds like you might be referring to Emmet, a plugin that allows you to write HTML and CSS code using shorthand syntax. 

To use Emmet, you can type out the shorthand syntax and then press the "Tab" key to expand it into the full HTML or CSS code. For example, typing `.classname` and then pressing "Tab" should expand into `<div class="classname"></div>`.

If this isn't working for you, make sure that you have Emmet installed and enabled in your code editor. The specific steps to do this will depend on your editor, but you can usually find instructions by searching for "install Emmet in [your editor name]".
