The error message indicates that Python is not installed on your system or it is not added to the PATH environment variable. 

To fix this issue, you need to install Python and add it to the PATH environment variable. Here are the steps to follow:

1. Download and install Python from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

2. During the installation process, make sure to select the option to add Python to the PATH environment variable.

3. After the installation is complete, open a new command prompt and type `python --version` to verify that Python is installed and added to the PATH.

4. If Python is installed and added to the PATH, try running the build again.

If the issue persists, you may need to update node-gyp to the latest version by running the following command:

```
npm install -g node-gyp
```

Then try running the build again.
