This error occurs because Bootstrap 4 requires the Popper.js library as a dependency. To fix this error, you need to install the Popper.js library using npm. 

You can install Popper.js by running the following command in your terminal:

```
npm install popper.js --save
```

After installing Popper.js, you need to import it in your JavaScript file before importing Bootstrap. You can do this by adding the following line of code:

```javascript
import Popper from 'popper.js';
```

Make sure to import Popper before importing Bootstrap and jQuery. This should resolve the "Module not found: can't resolve popper.js" error.
