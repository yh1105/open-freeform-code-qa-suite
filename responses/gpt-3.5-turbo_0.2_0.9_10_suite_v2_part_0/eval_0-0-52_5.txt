To remove a package installed using `ng add`, you can use the `npm uninstall` command followed by the package name. For example, if you want to remove the `@angular/material` package, you can run the following command:

```
npm uninstall @angular/material
```

After running this command, the package will be removed from your project and its dependencies will be updated accordingly.
