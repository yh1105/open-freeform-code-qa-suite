The `truncate` class in TailwindCSS only works if the element has a fixed width. You can add the `w-` class to set the width of the element. Here's an example:

```html
<div class="ml-1 inline-block">
  <span>Label: </span>
  <span class="font-semibold truncate w-40">
    long texttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttt
  </span>
</div>
```

In this example, the `w-40` class sets the width of the element to 40rem. You can adjust the width to fit your needs.
