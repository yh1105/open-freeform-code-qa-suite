The error message indicates that the `Keys` table is missing in the database. This could be caused by a migration issue during the upgrade process.

To solve this problem, you can try the following steps:

1. Open the Package Manager Console in Visual Studio by going to `Tools > NuGet Package Manager > Package Manager Console`.

2. Run the following command to generate a new migration:

   ```
   Add-Migration AddKeysTable
   ```

3. Run the following command to apply the migration to the database:

   ```
   Update-Database
   ```

   This will create the `Keys` table in the database.

If the above steps do not solve the problem, you can try deleting the database and creating a new one. To do this, you can run the following commands in the Package Manager Console:

```
Drop-Database
Update-Database
```

This will delete the existing database and create a new one with all the necessary tables. However, please note that this will also delete all the data in the database, so make sure to back up any important data before proceeding.
