This error occurs because of a conflict between the version of Maven used by IntelliJ and the version of Maven used by the Spring Boot project. 

To fix this error, you can try the following steps:

1. In IntelliJ, go to File > Settings > Build, Execution, Deployment > Build Tools > Maven.
2. Under "Maven home directory", select the option "Use bundled Maven 3".
3. Click "OK" to save the changes.
4. Re-import the Maven project.

If the above steps do not work, you can try updating the version of Maven used by the Spring Boot project. To do this, open the `pom.xml` file of the project and update the `maven.version` property to the latest version of Maven. For example:

```
<properties>
    <maven.version>3.8.3</maven.version>
</properties>
```

Save the changes and re-import the Maven project.
