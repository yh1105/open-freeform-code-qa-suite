To use Swagger UI with Spring Boot, you need to make sure that you have configured the necessary components correctly. Here are some things you can check:

1. Make sure that you have the `@EnableSwagger2` annotation on your Spring Boot application class. This enables Swagger support for your application.

2. Check that the `springdoc.swagger-ui.path` property is set to `/swagger-ui.html` in your `application.properties` file. This is the default path for Swagger UI.

3. Make sure that you have the correct version of the `springdoc-openapi-ui` dependency. You can check the latest version on the [Maven Central Repository](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.springdoc/springdoc-openapi-ui).

4. Check that you have the necessary configuration for Swagger in your `pom.xml` file. You can find an example configuration on the [springdoc-openapi GitHub page](https://github.com/springdoc/springdoc-openapi#springdoc-openapi-ui).

5. Verify that you have the necessary dependencies for Swagger in your `pom.xml` file. You can find an example configuration on the [springdoc-openapi GitHub page](https://github.com/springdoc/springdoc-openapi#springdoc-openapi-ui).

6. Check that you have the correct URL for Swagger UI. The default URL is `http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html`.

If you have checked all of these things and Swagger UI still does not work, you may need to debug your application to find the issue.
