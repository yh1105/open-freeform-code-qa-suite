It seems that there might be a version conflict between the Hibernate Validator version that is included in your Spring Boot parent pom and the version that is included in your Maven dependencies. 

You can try to exclude the Hibernate Validator dependency from your Spring Boot parent pom and add the desired version as a separate dependency in your pom.xml file. 

To do this, add the following exclusion to your parent pom:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-validation</artifactId>
    <exclusions>
        <exclusion>
            <groupId>org.hibernate.validator</groupId>
            <artifactId>hibernate-validator</artifactId>
        </exclusion>
    </exclusions>
</dependency>
```

Then, add the desired version of Hibernate Validator as a separate dependency in your pom.xml file:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.hibernate.validator</groupId>
    <artifactId>hibernate-validator</artifactId>
    <version>6.0.11.Final</version>
</dependency>
```

After making these changes, try running your application again and see if the issue is resolved.
