@Configuration should be used when you need to define beans that require complex initialization or have dependencies on other beans. It allows you to use the @Bean annotation to define individual beans and configure them as needed. @Service, @Controller, and @Component are used to mark classes as Spring-managed components, but they do not provide the same level of flexibility for bean configuration as @Configuration.
