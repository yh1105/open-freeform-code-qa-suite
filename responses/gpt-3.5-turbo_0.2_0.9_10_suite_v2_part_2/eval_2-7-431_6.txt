By default, Laravel's `dd()` function limits the output to 1024 characters. However, you can increase this limit by modifying the `outputBuffering` configuration option in your `config/app.php` file.

To increase the limit, simply add the following line to your `config/app.php` file:

```php
'outputBuffering' => 8192,
```

This will increase the output limit to 8192 characters. You can adjust this value to suit your needs.

Alternatively, you can use the `dump()` function instead of `dd()`. The `dump()` function will output the entire contents of the variable, without any limitations. However, it will not stop the execution of your code like `dd()` does.
