Both approaches are valid and work in Spring. However, using the `@Autowired` annotation on the constructor is considered a best practice because it makes the dependencies required and explicit. This means that if a required dependency is not provided, the application will fail to start, which can help catch errors early on. Additionally, using constructor injection with `@Autowired` can make the code more readable and easier to understand, as it clearly shows which dependencies are required for the class to function properly.
