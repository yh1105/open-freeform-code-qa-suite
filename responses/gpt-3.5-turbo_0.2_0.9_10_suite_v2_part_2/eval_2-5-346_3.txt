It seems like the Gradle build is not picking up the Java version that you have set in your project. You can try adding the following lines to your `build.gradle` file:

```
compileJava {
    options.release = 17
}
```

This will set the Java version to 17 for the compilation of your Java source code. 

If this doesn't work, you can try adding the following line to your `gradle.properties` file:

```
org.gradle.java.home=<path-to-your-Java-17-home-directory>
```

Replace `<path-to-your-Java-17-home-directory>` with the path to your Java 17 installation directory. This will tell Gradle to use Java 17 for the build.

After making these changes, try running your app again and see if the error is resolved.
