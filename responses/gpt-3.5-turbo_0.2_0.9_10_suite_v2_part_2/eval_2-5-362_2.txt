The error message you are seeing indicates that the `ConfigServerConfigDataMissingEnvironmentPostProcessor` is trying to import configuration from a Config Server, but it can't find the `spring.config.import` property.

Since your project is not a Config Server and doesn't use Config Server, you can disable the `ConfigServerConfigDataMissingEnvironmentPostProcessor` by adding the following property to your `@SpringBootTest` annotation:

```
@SpringBootTest(
    webEnvironment = WebEnvironment.RANDOM_PORT,
    classes = {
        ProductCompositeServiceApplication.class,
        TestSecurityConfig.class },
    properties = {
        "spring.main.allow-bean-definition-overriding=true",
        "spring.cloud.config.enabled=false" // disable Config Server
    })
```

This should disable the Config Server configuration and allow your tests to run without errors.
