```go
type A struct {
}

type B struct {
}

type AB interface {
    *A | *B
    some() bool
}

func (a *A) some() bool {
    return true
}

func (b *B) some() bool {
    return false
}

func some[T AB](x T) bool {
    return x.some()
}
```

In the `AB` interface, you need to add the `some()` method signature. This is because the `some()` method is not defined in the `*A` or `*B` types, but rather in the `AB` interface. By adding the method signature to the interface, you are telling the compiler that any type that implements the `AB` interface must also implement the `some()` method.
