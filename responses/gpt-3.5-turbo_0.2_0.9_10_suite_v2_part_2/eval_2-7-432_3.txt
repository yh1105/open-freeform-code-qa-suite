The error message "419 Page Expired" occurs when the CSRF token in the form does not match the token stored in the session. This can happen when the session has expired or when the user has multiple tabs open with the same session.

To avoid this error, you can add a check in your logout function to see if the user is already logged out. If the user is already logged out, then you can redirect them to the login page instead of trying to logout again.

Here's an example of how you can modify the default Laravel logout function to handle this scenario:

```
public function logout(Request $request)
{
    if (Auth::check()) {
        Auth::logout();
        $request->session()->invalidate();
        $request->session()->regenerateToken();
    }
    
    if ($request->session()->has('url.intended')) {
        $url = $request->session()->get('url.intended');
        $request->session()->forget('url.intended');
        return redirect()->to($url);
    }
    
    return redirect()->route('login');
}
```

This code checks if the user is already logged out using the `Auth::check()` function. If the user is already logged out, it redirects them to the login page. If the user is still logged in, it logs them out and redirects them to the intended URL or the login page if there is no intended URL.

By adding this check, you can avoid the "419 Page Expired" error and provide a better user experience for your users.
