You can specify the path to the Java executable that you want to use by setting the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable. 

To do this, you can follow these steps:

1. Determine the path to the Java executable that you want to use. For example, if you want to use the Java executable located at `/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-amd64/bin/java`, then that is the path you will use.

2. Set the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable to the path of the Java executable. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:

   ```
   export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-amd64
   ```

   Note that this command sets the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable for the current terminal session only. If you want to set it permanently, you will need to add this line to your shell's configuration file (e.g. `~/.bashrc` for Bash).

3. Run the Maven wrapper command as usual. It should now use the Java executable that you specified in the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable.

   ```
   ./mvnw clean install
   ```
