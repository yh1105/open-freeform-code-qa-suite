The error message "Failed to clear cache. Make sure you have the appropriate permissions." indicates that the user running the command does not have the necessary permissions to clear the cache. 

You can try running the command with elevated privileges by using `sudo` before the command:

```
sudo php artisan cache:clear
```

This will prompt you for your password and should allow you to clear the cache. If this still doesn't work, you may need to check the file permissions of the cache directory and ensure that the user running the command has write access to it.
