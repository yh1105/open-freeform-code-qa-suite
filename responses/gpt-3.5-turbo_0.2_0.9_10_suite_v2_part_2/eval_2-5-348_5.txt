The error message indicates that there is an issue with the path to the `mvn.cmd` file. The path contains spaces, which can cause issues with the command prompt.

To solve this issue, you can try enclosing the path to the `mvn.cmd` file in double quotes. Here's an example:

```
cd C:\projects\open; "JAVA_HOME=C:\\Program Files\\Java\\jdk-11.0.5" cmd /c "\"\"\"C:\\Program Files\\NetBeans-11.1\\netbeans\\java\\maven\\bin\\mvn.cmd\"\" -DskipTests=true -Dmaven.ext.class.path=\"C:\\Program Files\\NetBeans-11.1\\netbeans\\java\\maven-nblib\\netbeans-eventspy.jar\" -Dfile.encoding=UTF-8 clean install\""
```

In this example, the path to the `mvn.cmd` file is enclosed in triple quotes, which should prevent any issues with embedded quotes.
