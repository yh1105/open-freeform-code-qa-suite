You can specify the path to the Java executable that you want to use by setting the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable. 

To do this, follow these steps:

1. Determine the path to the Java executable that you want to use. For example, if you want to use Java 8, the path might be `/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-amd64/bin/java`.

2. Set the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable to the path that you determined in step 1. For example, if you are using a Unix-like operating system, you can set the variable by running the following command in your terminal:

   ```
   export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-amd64
   ```

   If you are using Windows, you can set the variable by following these steps:
   
   - Open the Control Panel.
   - Click on System and Security.
   - Click on System.
   - Click on Advanced system settings.
   - Click on the Environment Variables button.
   - Under System Variables, click on New.
   - Enter `JAVA_HOME` as the variable name and the path to the Java executable as the variable value.
   - Click OK to save the variable.

3. Run the Maven wrapper command again. It should now use the Java executable that you specified in the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable.
