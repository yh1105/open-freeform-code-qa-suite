The error message you are seeing is related to the Spring Cloud Config feature. It seems that the `spring-cloud-starter-config` dependency is causing the issue.

To fix the issue, you can try removing the `spring-cloud-starter-config` dependency from your `build.gradle` file. Since you mentioned that your project is not a ConfigServer and does not use ConfigServer, this dependency may not be necessary.

If you do need the `spring-cloud-starter-config` dependency for some reason, you can try setting the `spring.cloud.config.enabled` property to `false` in your test properties. This will disable the Spring Cloud Config feature for your tests.

Here's an example of how you can set the `spring.cloud.config.enabled` property in your test properties:

```java
@SpringBootTest(
    webEnvironment = WebEnvironment.RANDOM_PORT,
    classes = {
        ProductCompositeServiceApplication.class,
        TestSecurityConfig.class },
    properties = {
        "spring.main.allow-bean-definition-overriding=true",
        "spring.cloud.config.enabled=false" })
```

This should resolve the issue you are seeing in your JUnit tests.
