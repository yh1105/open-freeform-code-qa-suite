The "CSRF token mismatch" error occurs when the CSRF token generated by the server does not match the one sent by the client. This can happen due to various reasons, including session issues.

Based on your description, it seems that the issue is related to session management on the host domain. Here are a few things you can check:

1. Make sure that the session driver is set correctly on the host domain. If you are using the file driver, make sure that the storage directory is writable by the web server.

2. Check if the session cookie domain is set correctly. If it is set to a domain that is different from the one you are accessing the site from, it can cause session issues. You can set the session cookie domain in the `session.php` configuration file.

3. Check if the session cookie path is set correctly. If it is set to a path that is different from the one you are accessing the site from, it can cause session issues. You can set the session cookie path in the `session.php` configuration file.

4. Check if the session ID is being regenerated on every request. If it is, it can cause session issues. You can disable session ID regeneration by setting the `regenerate` option to `false` in the `session.php` configuration file.

5. Check if there are any caching mechanisms in place on the host domain that could be interfering with session management. If there are, you may need to configure them to exclude session data.

6. Check if there are any security mechanisms in place on the host domain that could be interfering with session management. For example, if there is a firewall that is blocking certain requests, it could be causing session issues.

I hope this helps you identify and resolve the issue.
