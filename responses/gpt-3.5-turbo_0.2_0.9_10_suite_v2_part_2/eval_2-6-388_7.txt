The `[Keyless]` attribute was introduced in Entity Framework Core 5.0. If you are using an earlier version of Entity Framework Core, you will not have access to this attribute.

To use `[Keyless]`, you need to make sure that your project is targeting .NET 5.0 or later and that you have installed the Entity Framework Core 5.0 (or later) package.

If you have already installed Entity Framework Core 5.0 and are still not seeing the `[Keyless]` attribute, try cleaning and rebuilding your project to make sure that all dependencies are properly resolved.

If you are still having issues, you can try manually adding the `[Keyless]` attribute to your project by defining it as follows:

```c#
namespace System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations
{
    [AttributeUsage(AttributeTargets.Class)]
    public class KeylessAttribute : Attribute { }
}
```

This should allow you to use `[Keyless]` in your code even if it is not available in the `System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations` namespace.
