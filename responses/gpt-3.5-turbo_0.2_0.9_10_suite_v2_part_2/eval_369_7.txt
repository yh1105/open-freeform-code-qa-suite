You can enable Dev Tools in IntelliJ 2021.2 by adding the following dependency in your Maven pom.xml file:

```
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-devtools</artifactId>
    <optional>true</optional>
</dependency>
```

Then, you can configure Dev Tools to automatically reload changes by adding the following line in your application.properties file:

```
spring.devtools.restart.enabled=true
```

With this configuration, you can make changes to your code and see the changes reflected in your application without having to restart the Tomcat server.
