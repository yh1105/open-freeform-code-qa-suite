You need to register the `ILogger` service in the `ServiceCollection` before building the `ServiceProvider`. You can do this by adding the following line to your code:
```c#
var services = new ServiceCollection()
    .AddLogging(logging => logging.AddConsole())
    .AddTransient<MyClass>() // Add this line
    .BuildServiceProvider();
```
This registers `MyClass` as a transient service in the `ServiceCollection`, which allows the `ILogger` dependency to be resolved when `MyClass` is instantiated.
