The error message suggests that your current PHP version or extensions may not be compatible with Laravel 9. Here are some steps you can take to resolve the issue:

1. Check your PHP version: Laravel 9 requires PHP 8.0 or higher. You can check your PHP version by running `php -v` in your terminal. If your PHP version is lower than 8.0, you will need to upgrade your PHP version.

2. Check your PHP extensions: Laravel 9 requires some PHP extensions to be installed and enabled. You can check if the required extensions are installed by running `php -m` in your terminal. If any of the required extensions are missing, you will need to install and enable them.

3. Check your Composer version: Laravel 9 requires Composer 2.0 or higher. You can check your Composer version by running `composer -V` in your terminal. If your Composer version is lower than 2.0, you will need to upgrade your Composer version.

Once you have resolved any issues with your PHP version, extensions, and Composer version, you should be able to run the `composer create-project laravel/laravel blog "9.*"` command successfully.
