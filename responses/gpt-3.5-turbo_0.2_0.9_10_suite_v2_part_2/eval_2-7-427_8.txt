For the first issue, the "CSRF token mismatch" error could be caused by a few things. One possibility is that the server's clock is not synchronized with the client's clock, causing the token to expire before it should. Another possibility is that the session is not being properly maintained between requests, causing the token to be lost. You can try increasing the SESSION_LIFETIME to a higher value to see if it resolves the issue. Additionally, you can check if the server is using a load balancer or reverse proxy, as this can also cause issues with session persistence.

For the second issue, the error message suggests that the SSL version being used is not supported by the server. You can try changing the encryption method to 'tls' instead of 'ssl' in your .env file and see if it resolves the issue. Additionally, you can try using port 465 instead of 587, as this is the default port for SMTP over SSL. If these solutions do not work, you may need to contact the email provider for further assistance.
