The error message "Failed to clear cache. Make sure you have the appropriate permissions." indicates that the user running the command does not have the necessary permissions to clear the cache. 

You can try running the command with elevated privileges by using `sudo` before the command, like this:

```
sudo php artisan cache:clear
```

This will prompt you for your password and then run the command with elevated privileges. If this still doesn't work, you may need to check the file permissions on your Laravel project directory and ensure that the user running the command has the necessary permissions to modify the cache files.
