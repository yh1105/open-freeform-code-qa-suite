The error message indicates that the `ConfigServerConfigDataMissingEnvironmentPostProcessor` is trying to import configuration from a Config Server, but it cannot find the `spring.config.import` property. This is likely because the `spring-cloud-starter-config` dependency is included in your project, which enables the Config Client functionality by default.

To fix this issue, you can exclude the `spring-cloud-starter-config` dependency from your project. You mentioned that you have already commented out the Config Client configuration, so excluding the dependency should not have any impact on your project.

To exclude the `spring-cloud-starter-config` dependency, add the following to your `build.gradle` file:

```
implementation('org.springframework.cloud:spring-cloud-starter-config') {
    exclude group: 'org.springframework.cloud', module: 'spring-cloud-config-client'
}
```

This will exclude the `spring-cloud-config-client` module, which is responsible for the Config Client functionality.

After making this change, you should be able to build and run your project without encountering the `spring.config.import` error.
