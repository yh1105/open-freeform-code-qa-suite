Using `@Autowired` on the constructor is a recommended approach because it makes the dependency injection explicit and mandatory. It ensures that the required dependencies are injected at the time of object creation, and it also makes the code more testable. Additionally, it helps to avoid circular dependencies and makes the code more readable. However, if you prefer to use the constructor without `@Autowired`, you can still use it, and Spring will automatically inject the dependencies.
