This error occurs because IntelliJ IDEA is using an older version of Maven (3.6.3) that is not compatible with Spring Boot 2.7, which requires Maven 3.8.5.

To fix this issue, you can follow these steps:

1. Open the Maven settings in IntelliJ IDEA by going to File > Settings > Build, Execution, Deployment > Build Tools > Maven.

2. Click on the "Maven home directory" field and select the directory where Maven 3.8.5 is installed.

3. Click "OK" to save the settings.

4. Re-import the Maven project by going to File > New > Project from Existing Sources and selecting the pom.xml file of your project.

5. Wait for IntelliJ IDEA to finish importing the project and resolving the dependencies.

6. If the error still persists, try deleting the .idea and target directories in your project and re-importing the project again.

This should resolve the error and allow you to work with Spring Boot 2.7 projects in IntelliJ IDEA.
