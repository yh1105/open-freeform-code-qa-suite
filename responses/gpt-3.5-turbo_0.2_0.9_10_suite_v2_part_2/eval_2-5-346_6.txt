It seems like the Gradle build is not picking up the Java 17 configuration from IntelliJ. You can try adding the following lines to your `build.gradle` file to explicitly set the Java version for Gradle:

```
compileJava {
    options.release = 17
}
```

This should tell Gradle to use Java 17 for compilation. If this doesn't work, you can also try adding the following line to your `gradle.properties` file:

```
org.gradle.java.home=/path/to/your/jdk
```

Replace `/path/to/your/jdk` with the path to your Java 17 installation. This should tell Gradle where to find the Java 17 installation.

After making these changes, try running your app again.
