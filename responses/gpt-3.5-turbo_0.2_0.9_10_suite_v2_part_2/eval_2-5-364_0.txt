You can specify the path to the Java executable that you want to use by setting the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable. Here's how you can do it:

1. Find the path to the Java executable that you want to use. You can do this by running `java -version` in your terminal. The output should include the path to the Java executable.

2. Set the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable to the path of the Java executable. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:

   ```
   export JAVA_HOME=/path/to/java
   ```

   Replace `/path/to/java` with the actual path to the Java executable that you want to use.

3. Run the Maven wrapper command as you normally would. Maven will use the Java executable specified in the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable.

   ```
   ./mvnw clean install
   ```

   Note that you need to use `./mvnw` instead of `mvn` to run the Maven wrapper.
