It seems like Gradle is not picking up the Java version that you have set in your IntelliJ project settings. To fix this, you can add the following lines to your `build.gradle` file:

```
compileJava {
    options.release = 17
}
```

This will tell Gradle to compile your Java code with Java 17. 

After adding this to your `build.gradle` file, try running your app again. It should now compile and run without any issues.
