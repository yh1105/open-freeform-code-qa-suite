The error message suggests that the response from the server is not in the expected JSON format. It seems that the response starts with a '<' character, which is not valid JSON.

One possible reason for this error is that the server is returning an HTML error page instead of the expected JSON data. To confirm this, you can try accessing the API endpoint directly in the browser and see if it returns the expected JSON data.

If the server is indeed returning an HTML error page, you need to fix the server-side code to return the expected JSON data. You can use a tool like Postman to test the API endpoint and see the actual response from the server.

If the server is returning the expected JSON data, you can try to modify the client-side code to handle the response correctly. One way to do this is to use the `HttpResponseMessage` class instead of the `GetJsonAsync` method, and manually deserialize the JSON data using a JSON serializer like `System.Text.Json`. Here's an example:

```c#
var response = await Http.GetAsync("/api/Employee/Index");
if (response.IsSuccessStatusCode)
{
    var json = await response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();
    var options = new JsonSerializerOptions { PropertyNameCaseInsensitive = true };
    var empList = JsonSerializer.Deserialize<Employee[]>(json, options);
    // do something with empList
}
else
{
    // handle error
}
``` 

This code first sends a GET request to the API endpoint using the `Http.GetAsync` method. If the response is successful (i.e., has a status code in the 200-299 range), it reads the JSON data from the response body using the `ReadAsStringAsync` method. Then it deserializes the JSON data into an array of `Employee` objects using the `JsonSerializer.Deserialize` method. Finally, it does something with the `empList` variable (e.g., assigns it to a property of the component).

If the response is not successful (i.e., has a status code outside the 200-299 range), you can handle the error in the `else` block. For example, you can display an error message to the user or log the error to the console.
