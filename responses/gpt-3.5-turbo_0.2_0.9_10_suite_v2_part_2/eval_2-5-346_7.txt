It seems like the Gradle build is not picking up the correct Java version. You can try adding the following lines to your `build.gradle` file to explicitly set the Java version for the Gradle build:

```
compileJava {
    options.release = 17
}
```

This should set the Java version to 17 for the compilation of your Java source code. 

If that doesn't work, you can try adding the following line to your `gradle.properties` file:

```
org.gradle.java.home=/path/to/your/jdk
```

Replace `/path/to/your/jdk` with the path to your Java 17 installation. This should tell Gradle to use the correct Java version for the build.

After making these changes, try running your app again and see if the error is resolved.
