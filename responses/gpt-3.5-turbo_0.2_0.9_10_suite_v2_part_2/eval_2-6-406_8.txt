In a .NET 6 Console Application, you can use the `Host` class to configure and run your application. Here's an example of how you can read the `appsettings.json` file:

```c#
using Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting;

var builder = new HostBuilder()
    .ConfigureAppConfiguration((hostingContext, config) =>
    {
        config.AddJsonFile("appsettings.json", optional: true, reloadOnChange: true);
    })
    .ConfigureServices((hostContext, services) =>
    {
        // Add your services here
    });

await builder.RunConsoleAsync();
```

In this example, we're using the `HostBuilder` to configure our application. We're adding the `appsettings.json` file to the configuration using the `ConfigureAppConfiguration` method. We're also using the `ConfigureServices` method to add our services.

Finally, we're running the application using the `RunConsoleAsync` method. This will start the application and keep it running until the user stops it.

Make sure to add the following NuGet packages to your project:

- Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration
- Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.FileExtensions
- Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.Json
- Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting
- Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting.Abstractions

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
