You can use the `JsonResult` class to return JSON with a specific HTTP status code in your .NET Core Web API controller. Here's an example:

```c#
public IActionResult IsAuthenticated()
{
    var data = "123";
    return new JsonResult(data)
    {
        StatusCode = 200 // or any other HTTP status code
    };
}
```

In this example, we create a new `JsonResult` object and pass in the data we want to return as JSON. We then set the `StatusCode` property of the `JsonResult` object to the desired HTTP status code.

Note that we're using `IActionResult` instead of `ActionResult` as the return type. This allows us to return different types of results, not just `ActionResult`.
