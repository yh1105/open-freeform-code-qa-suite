Using `@Autowired` on the constructor is a recommended practice in Spring because it makes the code more readable and less error-prone. It clearly indicates that the constructor requires a dependency to be injected, and it also ensures that the dependency is not null when the object is created. Additionally, using `@Autowired` on the constructor allows for constructor injection, which is considered a best practice in dependency injection. However, if you prefer to use setter injection or field injection, you can still do so without using `@Autowired` on the constructor.
