For the first question, the "CSRF token mismatch" error could be caused by a few things. Firstly, make sure that the `APP_KEY` in the `.env` file is set to a unique value. If it is not, generate a new key using the `php artisan key:generate` command. 

Secondly, check that the `SESSION_DOMAIN` in the `.env` file is not set to a specific domain. If it is, try removing it or setting it to the domain of your application. 

Thirdly, check that the server time is correct. If the server time is not correct, it can cause issues with the CSRF token. 

Lastly, make sure that the `APP_URL` in the `.env` file is set to the correct URL of your application. 

For the second question, the error message suggests that the SSL version being used is incorrect. Try changing the `MAIL_ENCRYPTION` in the `.env` file to `tls` instead of `ssl`. Also, make sure that the `MAIL_PORT` is set to `587` for TLS encryption. 

If that doesn't work, try removing the `MAIL_ENCRYPTION` line from the `.env` file and setting the `encryption` value in the `mail.php` file to `tls`. 

If none of these solutions work, it could be an issue with the SMTP server itself. Contact the server administrator or support team for further assistance.
