Using `@Autowired` on the constructor is a recommended practice in Spring. It makes the code more readable and easier to maintain. It also ensures that the required dependencies are injected at the time of object creation, making the object ready for use immediately. Additionally, it helps in writing unit tests as it makes it easier to mock the dependencies. However, if you prefer not to use `@Autowired`, you can still use constructor injection without it.
