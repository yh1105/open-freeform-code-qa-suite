The error message is telling you that you cannot use the `Gender` property as a column in the `User` table because it is already configured as a navigation property. 

To solve this problem, you can remove the line `user.HasIndex(x => x.Gender);` from your `OnModelCreating` method. This line is trying to create an index on the `Gender` property, which is not allowed because it is already configured as a navigation property.

After removing that line, you can run the `dotnet ef add migration User` command again and it should work without any errors.
