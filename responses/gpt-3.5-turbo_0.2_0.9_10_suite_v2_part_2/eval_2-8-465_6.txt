The `ext-zip` package is not a regular package that can be installed via Composer. It is actually a PHP extension that needs to be installed on your server. 

To install the `ext-zip` extension, you need to follow these steps:

1. Check if the extension is already installed by running the following command in your terminal:
```
php -m | grep zip
```
If the output contains `zip`, then the extension is already installed.

2. If the extension is not installed, you need to install it. The installation process varies depending on your operating system and PHP version. Here are some examples:

- For Ubuntu and PHP 7.4, you can install the extension by running the following command:
```
sudo apt-get install php7.4-zip
```

- For macOS and PHP 7.4 installed via Homebrew, you can install the extension by running the following command:
```
brew install php@7.4-zip
```

- For Windows and XAMPP, you can enable the extension by uncommenting the following line in your `php.ini` file:
```
extension=zip
```

3. After installing the extension, restart your web server and try running the `composer require ext-zip` command again. It should work now.

I hope this helps!
