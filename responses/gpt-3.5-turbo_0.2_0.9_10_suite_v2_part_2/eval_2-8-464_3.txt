The error message indicates that the Lambda function is unable to find the executable file `main` in the expected location `/var/task/main`. This is because the file was built on a Windows platform and has a different file extension (`.exe`) than the expected file extension on the Linux-based AWS Lambda platform.

To fix this issue, you need to build the executable file with the correct file name and extension for the AWS Lambda platform. You can do this by setting the `GOOS` and `GOARCH` environment variables to `linux` and `amd64` respectively before building the executable file.

Here are the steps to build and deploy the Go AWS Lambda handler on a Windows platform:

1. Open a command prompt and navigate to the directory containing your Go code.

2. Set the `GOOS` and `GOARCH` environment variables to `linux` and `amd64` respectively by running the following commands:

   ```
   set GOOS=linux
   set GOARCH=amd64
   ```

3. Build the executable file with the correct file name and extension by running the following command:

   ```
   go build -o main main.go
   ```

   This will create an executable file named `main` without the `.exe` extension.

4. Zip the `main` executable file by running the following command:

   ```
   zip main.zip main
   ```

5. Upload the `main.zip` file to your AWS Lambda function using the AWS console.

6. Test your Lambda function to ensure that it is working correctly.

With these steps, your Go AWS Lambda function should be able to find the executable file and run without any issues.
