In a .NET 6 Console Application, you can use the `Host` class to create a host for your application and configure it to read configuration from your `appsettings.json` file.

Here's an example of how you can do this in your `Program.cs` file:

```csharp
using Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting;

var builder = new HostBuilder()
    .ConfigureAppConfiguration((hostingContext, config) =>
    {
        config.AddJsonFile("appsettings.json", optional: true, reloadOnChange: true);
    })
    .ConfigureServices((hostContext, services) =>
    {
        // Add your services here
    });

await builder.RunConsoleAsync();
```

This code creates a `HostBuilder` instance and configures it to read configuration from the `appsettings.json` file. You can then add your services to the `ConfigureServices` method.

Note that you need to add the `Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration` and `Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting` packages to your project for this to work.
