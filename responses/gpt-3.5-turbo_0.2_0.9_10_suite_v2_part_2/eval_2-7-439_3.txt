The `ext-zip` package is not a regular package that can be installed via Composer. It is actually a PHP extension that needs to be installed on your server. 

To install the `ext-zip` extension, you need to follow these steps:

1. Check if the extension is already installed on your server by running the following command in your terminal:

   ```
   php -m | grep zip
   ```

   If the extension is already installed, you should see `zip` in the output.

2. If the extension is not installed, you need to install it. The method for doing this depends on your operating system and the web server you are using. Here are some examples:

   - For Ubuntu with Apache, you can install the extension by running the following command:

     ```
     sudo apt-get install php-zip
     ```

   - For CentOS with Apache, you can install the extension by running the following command:

     ```
     sudo yum install php-zip
     ```

   - For macOS with Apache, you can install the extension by running the following command:

     ```
     brew install php@7.4
     ```

     Then, add the following line to your `httpd.conf` file:

     ```
     LoadModule php7_module /usr/local/opt/php@7.4/lib/httpd/modules/libphp7.so
     ```

3. After installing the extension, restart your web server and try running the `composer require ext-zip` command again. It should work now.
