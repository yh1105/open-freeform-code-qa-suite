Using `@Autowired` on the constructor is a recommended practice in Spring because it promotes better code readability and maintainability. It clearly indicates that the class has a dependency on another class, and it also ensures that the dependency is satisfied at the time of object creation. Additionally, it makes the class immutable, which is a good design practice. However, if you prefer to use setter injection or field injection, you can still do so in Spring.
