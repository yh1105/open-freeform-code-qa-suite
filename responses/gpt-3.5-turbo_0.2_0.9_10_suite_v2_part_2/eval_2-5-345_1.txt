This error occurs because IntelliJ IDEA is using a different version of Maven than the one specified in the project. To fix this issue, you can try the following steps:

1. Go to File -> Settings -> Build, Execution, Deployment -> Build Tools -> Maven.
2. Check the "Override" checkbox next to "Maven home directory".
3. In the "Maven home directory" field, specify the path to the Maven installation that matches the version specified in the project (in this case, Maven 3.8.5).
4. Click "OK" to save the changes.

If this doesn't work, you can try deleting the `.idea` folder in the project directory and re-importing the project into IntelliJ IDEA. This will reset all the IntelliJ IDEA settings for the project and may fix the issue.
