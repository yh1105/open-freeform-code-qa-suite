The `getDoctrine()` method is not officially deprecated in Symfony 5. However, it is marked as deprecated in Symfony 4.4 and will be removed in Symfony 5.0.

If you are using Symfony 4.4, you should use the `getDoctrine()` method with a `ContainerInterface` argument instead of calling it directly on the controller. Here's an example:

```php
use Symfony\Bundle\FrameworkBundle\Controller\AbstractController;
use Symfony\Component\DependencyInjection\ContainerInterface;

class MyController extends AbstractController
{
    public function myAction(ContainerInterface $container)
    {
        $doctrine = $container->get('doctrine');

        // ...
    }
}
```

If you are using Symfony 5.0 or later, you should use the `getDoctrine()` method directly on the controller, as it is no longer marked as deprecated.
