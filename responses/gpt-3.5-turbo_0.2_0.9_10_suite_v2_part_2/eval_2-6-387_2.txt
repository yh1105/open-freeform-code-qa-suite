The error message indicates that the `Keys` table is missing in the database. You can try the following steps to solve the problem:

1. Make sure that the database is up to date with the latest migrations. You can run the following command in the Package Manager Console to apply any pending migrations:

   ```
   Update-Database
   ```

2. If the `Update-Database` command doesn't work, you can try to create the `Keys` table manually by running the following SQL script in the database:

   ```
   CREATE TABLE "Keys" (
       "Id" TEXT NOT NULL CONSTRAINT "PK_Keys" PRIMARY KEY,
       "Algorithm" TEXT NOT NULL,
       "Created" INTEGER NOT NULL,
       "Data" TEXT NOT NULL,
       "DataProtected" TEXT,
       "IsX509Certificate" INTEGER NOT NULL,
       "Use" TEXT NOT NULL,
       "Version" TEXT NOT NULL
   );
   ```

3. If the `Keys` table already exists in the database, you can try to delete the database and recreate it by running the following commands in the Package Manager Console:

   ```
   Drop-Database
   Update-Database
   ```

   Note that this will delete all data in the database, so make sure to backup any important data before running these commands.

4. If none of the above steps work, you can try to debug the code and see if there are any issues with the database connection or the IdentityServer configuration. You can also try to revert back to the previous version of ASP.NET Core and IdentityServer4 to see if the problem goes away.
