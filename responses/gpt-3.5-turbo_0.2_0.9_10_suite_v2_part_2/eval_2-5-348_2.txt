The error message suggests that there is an issue with the path to the `mvn.cmd` file. Specifically, it seems that the path contains embedded quotes which are causing the error.

One solution to this problem is to use the short name for the "Program Files" directory, which does not contain any spaces or quotes. You can obtain the short name for a directory by opening a command prompt and running the `dir /x` command. This will display the short names for all directories in the current directory.

In your case, you can try replacing the path to `mvn.cmd` with the short name for the "Program Files" directory, like this:

```
cd C:\projects\open; "JAVA_HOME=C:\\Program Files\\Java\\jdk-11.0.5" cmd /c "\"\"C:\\Progra~1\\NetBeans-11.1\\netbeans\\java\\maven\\bin\\mvn.cmd\" -DskipTests=true -Dmaven.ext.class.path=\"C:\\Progra~1\\NetBeans-11.1\\netbeans\\java\\maven-nblib\\netbeans-eventspy.jar\" -Dfile.encoding=UTF-8 clean install\""
```

This should avoid the issue with embedded quotes in the path and allow the command to run successfully.
