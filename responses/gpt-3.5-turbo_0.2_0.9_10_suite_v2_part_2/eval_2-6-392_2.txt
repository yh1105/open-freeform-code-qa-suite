Having separate pipelines for specific requests is not necessarily a bad practice. In fact, it can be a good practice to keep the logic for each request separate and organized. 

However, it's important to consider the overall design of your application and make sure that having separate pipelines doesn't lead to unnecessary complexity or duplication of code. 

If you find that you have a lot of separate pipelines for specific requests, it may be worth considering if there is a way to refactor your code to make it more modular and reusable. For example, you could create a base pipeline class that handles common logic and then have separate classes that inherit from it and add specific logic for each request. 

Ultimately, the decision of whether to have separate pipelines or not depends on the specific requirements and design of your application.
