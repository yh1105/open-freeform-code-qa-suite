The `ext-zip` package is not a regular package that can be installed via Composer. It is a PHP extension that needs to be installed on your server. 

To install the `ext-zip` extension, you need to follow these steps:

1. Check if the extension is already installed on your server by running the following command in your terminal:

   ```
   php -m | grep zip
   ```

   If the extension is installed, you should see `zip` in the list of installed modules.

2. If the extension is not installed, you need to install it. The installation process depends on your server's operating system and the PHP version you are using. Here are some examples:

   - For Ubuntu and PHP 7.4, you can install the extension by running the following command:

     ```
     sudo apt-get install php7.4-zip
     ```

   - For CentOS and PHP 7.4, you can install the extension by running the following command:

     ```
     sudo yum install php74-php-zip
     ```

   - For macOS and PHP 7.4, you can install the extension by running the following command:

     ```
     brew install php@7.4
     brew install php@7.4-zip
     ```

3. After installing the extension, restart your web server to apply the changes.

Once the `ext-zip` extension is installed, you should be able to use it in your PHP code without any issues.
