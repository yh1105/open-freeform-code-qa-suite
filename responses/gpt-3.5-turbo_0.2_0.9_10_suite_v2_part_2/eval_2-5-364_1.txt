You can specify the path to the Java executable that you want to use by setting the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable. 

To do this, follow these steps:

1. Determine the path to the Java executable that you want to use. You can do this by running the following command in a terminal or command prompt:

   ```
   which java
   ```

   This will output the path to the Java executable that is currently being used.

2. Set the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable to the path of the Java executable that you want to use. You can do this by running the following command in a terminal or command prompt:

   ```
   export JAVA_HOME=/path/to/java
   ```

   Replace `/path/to/java` with the path to the Java executable that you want to use.

3. Run the Maven command using the Maven wrapper. Maven will now use the Java executable that you specified in the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable.

   ```
   ./mvnw <maven-command>
   ```

   Replace `<maven-command>` with the Maven command that you want to run.
