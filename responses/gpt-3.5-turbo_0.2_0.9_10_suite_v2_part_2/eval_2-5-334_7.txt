@Configuration should be used when you need to define beans that require additional configuration beyond what is possible with the other annotations. This includes defining beans that require complex initialization logic, or defining beans that need to be created conditionally based on certain runtime conditions. Additionally, @Configuration can be used to import other configuration classes and to define bean post-processors.
