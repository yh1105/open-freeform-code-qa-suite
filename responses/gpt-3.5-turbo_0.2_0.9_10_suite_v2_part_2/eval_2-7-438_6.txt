You should use the following command to rollback the migration:
```
bin/console --env=dev doctrine:migrations:execute 'Application\Migrations\Version20210909072642' --down --no-interaction -vvv
```
Make sure to use the full namespace of the migration class, which in this case is `Application\Migrations\Version20210909072642`.
