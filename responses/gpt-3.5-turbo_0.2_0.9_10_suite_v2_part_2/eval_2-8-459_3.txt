It seems like the module `github.ibm.com/kms/key-protect-client` is not being downloaded to the module cache on computer B. Here are some steps you can take to debug this issue:

1. Check if the module is present in the module cache on computer B. You can do this by running the following command:

   ```bash
   go list -m github.ibm.com/kms/key-protect-client
   ```

   If the module is not present in the cache, then it needs to be downloaded. You can download it by running:

   ```bash
   go get github.ibm.com/kms/key-protect-client@v0.1.5
   ```

2. Check if the module is accessible from computer B. You can do this by running the following command:

   ```bash
   go list -m -versions github.ibm.com/kms/key-protect-client
   ```

   This should list all the available versions of the module. If it doesn't, then it means that the module is not accessible from computer B.

3. Check if there are any network issues that are preventing the module from being downloaded. You can do this by running the following command:

   ```bash
   go env GONOPROXY GONOSUMDB GOPRIVATE
   ```

   This will show you the values of the environment variables that control module fetching. Make sure that the module is not excluded by any of these variables.

4. Check if there are any issues with the authentication credentials on computer B. You can do this by running the following command:

   ```bash
   git config --list
   ```

   This will show you the Git configuration on computer B. Make sure that the credentials for accessing the private repository are correctly configured.

I hope these steps help you debug the issue. Let me know if you have any further questions.
