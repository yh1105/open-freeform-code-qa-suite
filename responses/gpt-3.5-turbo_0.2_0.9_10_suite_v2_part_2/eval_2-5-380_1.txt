In addition to adding the `springdoc-openapi-ui` dependency, you also need to configure Spring Boot to use it. Here are the steps to follow:

1. Add the `@EnableSwagger2WebMvc` annotation to your Spring Boot application class. This will enable Swagger UI and configure it to use the default URL `/swagger-ui.html`.

```java
@SpringBootApplication
@EnableSwagger2WebMvc
public class MyApplication {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(MyApplication.class, args);
    }
}
```

2. Make sure that your application is running on the root context path (`/`). If your application is running on a different context path, you need to configure Swagger UI to use that path. You can do this by adding the following property to your `application.properties` file:

```properties
server.servlet.context-path=/my-app-context-path
```

3. If you're using Spring Security, you need to allow access to the Swagger UI resources. You can do this by adding the following configuration to your security configuration class:

```java
@Configuration
@EnableWebSecurity
public class SecurityConfig extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {
    @Override
    protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
        http.authorizeRequests()
            .antMatchers("/swagger-ui.html", "/swagger-ui/**", "/v3/api-docs/**")
            .permitAll()
            .anyRequest()
            .authenticated();
    }
}
```

With these steps, you should be able to access Swagger UI at `http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html`.
