It seems like the Gradle build is not picking up the correct Java version. You can try adding the following lines to your `build.gradle` file:

```
compileJava {
    options.release = 17
}
```

This will set the Java version to 17 for the compilation process. 

If that doesn't work, you can also try adding the following line to your `gradle.properties` file:

```
org.gradle.java.home=/path/to/your/jdk
```

Replace `/path/to/your/jdk` with the path to your Java 17 installation directory. This will tell Gradle to use the specified JDK for the build process.

After making these changes, try running your app again. It should now use Java 17 and the error should be resolved.
