You can try using the full namespace of the migration class in the `doctrine:migrations:execute` command. In your case, it would be:
```
bin/console --env=dev doctrine:migrations:execute 'Application\Migrations\Version20210909072642' --down --no-interaction -vvv
```
Make sure to enclose the namespace in quotes to avoid any issues with special characters.
