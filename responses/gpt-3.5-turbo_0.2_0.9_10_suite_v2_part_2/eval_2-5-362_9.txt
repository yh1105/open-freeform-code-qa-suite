The error message indicates that the `ConfigServerConfigDataMissingEnvironmentPostProcessor` is trying to import configuration from a Config Server, but it cannot find the `spring.config.import` property. This may be caused by a change in the default behavior of Spring Cloud Config in version `2020.0.2`.

To fix this issue, you can try adding the following property to your test properties:

```
spring.config.import=optional:configserver:
```

This will tell Spring Cloud Config to look for configuration in a Config Server, but it will not fail if it cannot find one.

Alternatively, you can disable the Config Server configuration completely by adding the following property:

```
spring.cloud.config.enabled=false
```

This will prevent Spring Cloud Config from trying to import configuration from a Config Server.

Make sure to add these properties to the `@SpringBootTest` annotation in your test class.
