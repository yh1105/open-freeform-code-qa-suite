The error message indicates that the `Keys` table is missing in the database. This could be caused by a migration issue during the upgrade process.

To solve this problem, you can try the following steps:

1. Open the Package Manager Console in Visual Studio by going to Tools > NuGet Package Manager > Package Manager Console.

2. Run the following command to generate a new migration:

   ```
   Add-Migration AddKeysTable
   ```

3. Run the following command to update the database:

   ```
   Update-Database
   ```

   This will apply the migration and create the `Keys` table in the database.

If the above steps do not work, you can try deleting the database and creating a new one by running the following commands:

```
dotnet ef database drop
dotnet ef database update
```

Note that this will delete all data in the database, so make sure to back up any important data before running these commands.
