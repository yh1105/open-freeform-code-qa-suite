To use the Swagger UI with Spring Boot, you need to do the following:

1. Make sure that the `springdoc-openapi-ui` dependency is added to your `pom.xml` file.

2. Add the `@EnableSwagger2WebMvc` annotation to your main Spring Boot application class.

3. Make sure that your API documentation is available at `/v3/api-docs`. You can do this by adding the following property to your `application.properties` file:

   ```
   springdoc.swagger-ui.path=/swagger-ui.html
   ```

   This will map the Swagger UI to `/swagger-ui.html`.

4. Make sure that your API documentation is available at `/v3/api-docs`. You can do this by adding the following property to your `application.properties` file:

   ```
   springdoc.swagger-ui.url=/v3/api-docs
   ```

   This will tell the Swagger UI where to find the API documentation.

5. Run your Spring Boot application and navigate to `http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html`. You should now see the Swagger UI with your API documentation.

If you have followed these steps and are still experiencing issues, make sure that your API documentation is available at `/v3/api-docs` and that the `springdoc.swagger-ui.path` and `springdoc.swagger-ui.url` properties are set correctly.
