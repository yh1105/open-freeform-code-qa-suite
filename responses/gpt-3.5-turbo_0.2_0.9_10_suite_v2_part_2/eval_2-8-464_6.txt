The error message indicates that the Lambda function is unable to find the executable file `main` in the `/var/task` directory. This is likely because the executable file was not properly included in the ZIP file that was uploaded to AWS Lambda.

To fix this issue, you can try the following steps:

1. Make sure that you are building the executable file for the correct platform. Since you are building the code on a Windows platform, you need to build it for the Linux platform that AWS Lambda uses. You can do this by setting the `GOOS` and `GOARCH` environment variables before building the code:

   ```
   set GOOS=linux
   set GOARCH=amd64
   go build main.go
   ```

2. After building the executable file, create a new ZIP file that includes the executable file and any other necessary files. You can do this using the following command:

   ```
   zip main.zip main
   ```

   This will create a new ZIP file named `main.zip` that includes the `main` executable file.

3. Upload the new ZIP file to AWS Lambda and test the function again.

If the issue persists, you can try checking the permissions on the executable file and make sure that it is executable. You can do this by running the following command:

```
chmod +x main
```

This will give the executable file the necessary permissions to be executed by AWS Lambda.
