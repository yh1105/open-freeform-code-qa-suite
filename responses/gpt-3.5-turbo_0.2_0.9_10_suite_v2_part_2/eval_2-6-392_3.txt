Having separate pipelines for specific requests is not necessarily a bad practice, especially if the logic for each request is significantly different. It can help keep the code organized and easier to maintain in the long run.

However, if you find yourself creating many separate pipelines for different requests, it may be worth considering if there is a way to generalize the logic and create a more generic pipeline that can handle multiple types of requests. This can help reduce code duplication and make it easier to add new requests in the future.

Ultimately, the decision to use separate pipelines or a more generic approach will depend on the specific requirements of your application and the trade-offs between maintainability and flexibility.
