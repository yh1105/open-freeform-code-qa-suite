For the first question, the issue could be related to the session configuration on the host domain. You may want to check if the session driver and configuration on the host domain are the same as the ones you have locally. Also, ensure that the session cookie domain is set correctly in the `.env` file. If the issue persists, you may want to try clearing the session data on the host domain and see if that resolves the issue.

For the second question, the error message suggests that the SSL version being used is incorrect. You may want to try changing the encryption type to `tls` instead of `ssl` in the `.env` file and see if that resolves the issue. Additionally, you may want to check if the SMTP server requires a specific SSL version and update your configuration accordingly.
