Here's the implementation of the `createPriorityQueue` function in Java:

```java
public static PriorityQueue<Pair<Integer, Integer>> createPriorityQueue() {
    return new PriorityQueue<>(Comparator.comparingInt(Pair::getKey));
}
```

This function creates a new `PriorityQueue` of `Pair<Integer, Integer>` objects, where the smallest key of pairs is considered as priority. The `Comparator.comparingInt(Pair::getKey)` method is used to compare the keys of the pairs and determine their priority.
