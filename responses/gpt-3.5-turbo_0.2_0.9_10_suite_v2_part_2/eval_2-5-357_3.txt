Using `@Autowired` on the constructor is a recommended practice in Spring because it makes the code more readable and easier to maintain. It also ensures that the required dependencies are injected at the time of object creation, making the object ready for use immediately. Additionally, it helps to avoid circular dependencies and makes the code more testable. However, if you prefer to use constructor injection without `@Autowired`, you can still do so.
