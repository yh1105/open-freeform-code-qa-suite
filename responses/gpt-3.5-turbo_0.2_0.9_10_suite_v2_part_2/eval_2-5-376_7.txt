It seems like IntelliJ IDEA is still using the old version of Java (1.8) to compile your code. You need to configure IntelliJ IDEA to use the new version of Java (11) instead.

Here's how you can do it:

1. Go to `File > Project Structure > SDKs`.
2. Click the `+` button to add a new SDK.
3. Select `JDK`.
4. Navigate to the directory where you installed Java 11 (e.g. `C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-11.0.1`) and select it.
5. Click `OK` to save the new SDK.
6. Go to `File > Project Structure > Project`.
7. Under `Project SDK`, select the new SDK you just added.
8. Click `OK` to save the changes.

Now IntelliJ IDEA should be using Java 11 to compile your code. You can verify this by checking the `Project SDK` setting in the `Project Structure` dialog, and also by checking the `Compile` tab in the `Build` menu to see if the target bytecode version is set to 11.
