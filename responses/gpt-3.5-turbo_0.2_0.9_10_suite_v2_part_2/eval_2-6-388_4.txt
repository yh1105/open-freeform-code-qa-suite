The `[Keyless]` attribute was introduced in Entity Framework Core 5.0. If you are using a version of Entity Framework Core prior to 5.0, you will not have access to this attribute.

To use `[Keyless]`, you need to make sure you are using Entity Framework Core 5.0 or later. You can check the version of Entity Framework Core you are using by looking at the version number of the `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore` package in your project's dependencies.

If you are using a version of Entity Framework Core prior to 5.0, you can still create keyless entities by defining a class with no primary key and using the `HasNoKey()` method in your `OnModelCreating` method to configure it as a keyless entity. For example:

```c#
public class MyKeylessClass
{
    public string Property1 { get; set; }
    public int Property2 { get; set; }
}

protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder modelBuilder)
{
    modelBuilder.Entity<MyKeylessClass>().HasNoKey();
}
```

Then, you can use the `FromSqlRaw()` method to query the keyless entity:

```c#
var results = context.Set<MyKeylessClass>().FromSqlRaw("SELECT Property1, Property2 FROM MyView").ToList();
```
