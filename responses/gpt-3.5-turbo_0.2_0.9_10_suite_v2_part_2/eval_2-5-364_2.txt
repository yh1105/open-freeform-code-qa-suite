If you want to use the same version of Java that works with the Maven task, you can specify the path to the Java executable in your Maven wrapper configuration file (`./mvnw` or `./mvnw.cmd`).

In the `mvnw` file, you can add the following line at the beginning of the file:

```
export JAVA_HOME=/path/to/java/home
```

Replace `/path/to/java/home` with the path to the Java home directory that works with the Maven task.

In the `mvnw.cmd` file, you can add the following line at the beginning of the file:

```
set JAVA_HOME=C:\path\to\java\home
```

Replace `C:\path\to\java\home` with the path to the Java home directory that works with the Maven task.

After making this change, you should be able to run Maven using the Maven wrapper with the same version of Java that works with the Maven task.
