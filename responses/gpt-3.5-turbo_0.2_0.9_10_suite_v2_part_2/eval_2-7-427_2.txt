For the first question, the issue could be related to the session driver configuration on the host domain. You mentioned that you changed the SESSION_DRIVER to file to see the sessions, but it's possible that the host domain is using a different session driver that is not compatible with Laravel's default session driver. You can try changing the SESSION_DRIVER to a different driver like database or redis to see if that resolves the issue.

For the second question, the error message suggests that there is an issue with the SSL certificate on the mail server. You can try changing the MAIL_ENCRYPTION to tls instead of ssl, as some servers do not support SSL encryption. Additionally, you can try setting the MAIL_SMTP_SECURE option to false in your mail.php configuration file. This will disable SSL/TLS encryption for the SMTP connection. If none of these solutions work, you may need to contact the email server administrator to ensure that the SSL certificate is valid and compatible with your application.
