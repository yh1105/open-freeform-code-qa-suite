Here is the declaration of `ClientInfo` struct in Go:

```go
type ClientInfo struct {
    Clients []struct {
        Hostname string `json:"Hostname"`
        IP string `json:"IP"`
        MacAddr string `json:"MacAddr"`
    } `json:"Clients"`
}
```

This struct has a field named `Clients` which is an array of anonymous structs. Each anonymous struct has three fields: `Hostname`, `IP`, and `MacAddr`. The `json` tags are used to specify the names of the corresponding keys in the JSON object.
