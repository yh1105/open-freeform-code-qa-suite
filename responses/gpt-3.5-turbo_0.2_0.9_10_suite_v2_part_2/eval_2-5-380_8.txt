In addition to adding the `springdoc-openapi-ui` dependency, you also need to configure Spring Boot to use it. Here are the steps to follow:

1. Add the `@EnableSwagger2WebMvc` annotation to your Spring Boot application class.

```java
@SpringBootApplication
@EnableSwagger2WebMvc
public class YourApplication {
    // ...
}
```

2. Configure the Swagger UI endpoint in your `application.properties` file.

```properties
springdoc.swagger-ui.path=/swagger-ui.html
```

3. Make sure that your application is running on the correct port. By default, Spring Boot applications run on port 8080, but you can change this by setting the `server.port` property in your `application.properties` file.

```properties
server.port=8080
```

4. Finally, make sure that your application is actually generating OpenAPI documentation. You can do this by adding the `@OpenAPIDefinition` annotation to your application class and configuring it appropriately.

```java
@SpringBootApplication
@EnableSwagger2WebMvc
@OpenAPIDefinition(
    info = @Info(
        title = "Your Application",
        version = "1.0",
        description = "API documentation for Your Application"
    )
)
public class YourApplication {
    // ...
}
```

Once you've made these changes, you should be able to access the Swagger UI at `http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html`.
