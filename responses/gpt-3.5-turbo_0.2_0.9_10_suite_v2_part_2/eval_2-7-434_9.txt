The `getDoctrine()` method is not officially deprecated, but it is marked as "internal" and should not be used in your code. Instead, you should use dependency injection to get the Doctrine object.

Here's an example of how to do this in a controller:

```php
use Doctrine\ORM\EntityManagerInterface;
use Symfony\Bundle\FrameworkBundle\Controller\AbstractController;

class MyController extends AbstractController
{
    public function myAction(EntityManagerInterface $entityManager)
    {
        // use $entityManager to interact with the database
    }
}
```

In this example, we're using dependency injection to get the `EntityManagerInterface` object, which is an instance of Doctrine's `EntityManager` class. You can then use this object to interact with the database.

Note that you'll need to make sure that the `EntityManagerInterface` is available in your service container. If you're using the default Symfony configuration, this should already be set up for you.
