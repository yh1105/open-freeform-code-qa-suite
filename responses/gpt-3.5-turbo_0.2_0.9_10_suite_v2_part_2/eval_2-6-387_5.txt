The error message indicates that the table "Keys" does not exist in the database. This could be caused by a few different things, such as a missing migration or a database schema that is out of sync with the code.

To solve this problem, you can try the following steps:

1. Check if the "Keys" table exists in the database. You can use a SQLite client like DB Browser for SQLite to connect to the database and check if the table exists.

2. If the table does not exist, you may need to create a migration to add the table to the database. You can use the following command in the Package Manager Console to create a migration:

   ```
   Add-Migration AddKeysTable
   ```

   This will create a new migration file in the Migrations folder of your project. You can then use the following command to apply the migration to the database:

   ```
   Update-Database
   ```

   This will update the database schema to include the "Keys" table.

3. If the table exists but the schema is out of sync with the code, you can try running the following command in the Package Manager Console to update the database schema:

   ```
   Update-Database
   ```

   This will apply any pending migrations to the database and update the schema to match the code.

If none of these steps solve the problem, you may need to provide more information about your project and database setup to diagnose the issue further.
