The error message suggests that the response from the server is not in the expected JSON format. It looks like the response starts with a '<' character, which indicates that it might be an HTML error page instead of a JSON response.

To troubleshoot this issue, you can try the following steps:

1. Check the network tab in your browser's developer tools to see the actual response from the server. Make sure it is a valid JSON response and not an error page.

2. Make sure the URL you are using to call the API is correct. In your code, you are using "/api/Employee/Index", but in your controller, you have specified the route as "[Route("api/Employee/Index")]". Try changing the URL in your code to "/Employee/Index" and see if it works.

3. Try calling the API using a tool like Postman or curl to see if you get a valid JSON response. This will help you determine if the issue is with your code or with the server.

4. If none of the above steps work, try adding some logging statements to your code to see where the error is occurring. You can use the built-in logging functionality in ASP.NET Core to log messages to the console or a file.

Here's an example of how you can modify your code to log messages to the console:

```c#
empList = await Http.GetJsonAsync<Employee[]>("/api/Employee/Index");
Console.WriteLine("Received response: " + JsonSerializer.Serialize(empList));
```

This will print the JSON response to the console, which can help you determine if the issue is with the server or with your code.
