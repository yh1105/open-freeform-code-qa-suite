You can use the `JsonResult` class to return JSON with a HTTP status code in your .NET Core Web API controller. Here's an example:

```c#
public JsonResult IsAuthenticated()
{
    return new JsonResult("123")
    {
        StatusCode = 200
    };
}
```

In this example, we are creating a new `JsonResult` object and setting its `StatusCode` property to `200` to indicate a successful response. The `JsonResult` constructor takes an object that will be serialized to JSON and returned as the response body.

You can also use the `Ok` method to return a JSON response with a HTTP status code:

```c#
public IActionResult IsAuthenticated()
{
    return Ok("123");
}
```

In this example, we are using the `Ok` method to return a `200 OK` response with the string `"123"` serialized as JSON in the response body.
