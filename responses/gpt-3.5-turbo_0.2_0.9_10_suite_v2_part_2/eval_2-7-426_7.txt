The "CSRF token mismatch" error occurs when the CSRF token generated by the server does not match the one sent by the client. This can happen due to various reasons, including session issues.

In your case, since you are seeing multiple sessions being generated for one user, it is possible that the session configuration on the host domain is causing the issue. Here are some things you can check:

1. Make sure that the session driver on the host domain is set to the same as the one on your local environment. If you are using the file driver locally, make sure that it is also set to file on the host domain.

2. Check the session cookie domain and path settings in your Laravel application. Make sure that they are set correctly for your domain. If they are not set correctly, the session cookie may not be sent or received properly, causing multiple sessions to be created.

3. Check if there are any caching or load balancing configurations on the host domain that could be affecting the sessions. If there are, make sure that they are configured correctly for your Laravel application.

4. Check if there are any security configurations on the host domain that could be blocking or modifying the session data. If there are, make sure that they are configured correctly for your Laravel application.

5. Check if there are any differences in the PHP configuration between your local environment and the host domain. If there are, make sure that they are configured correctly for your Laravel application.

Once you have checked these things, try generating a new CSRF token and see if the issue persists. If it does, you may need to do some more debugging to identify the root cause of the issue.
