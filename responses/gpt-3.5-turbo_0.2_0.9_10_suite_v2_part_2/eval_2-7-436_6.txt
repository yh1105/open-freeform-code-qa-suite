The error message suggests that your current PHP version, PHP extensions, or Composer version may not be compatible with Laravel 9. Here are some steps you can take to resolve the issue:

1. Check your PHP version: Laravel 9 requires PHP 8.0 or higher. You can check your PHP version by running `php -v` in your terminal. If your PHP version is lower than 8.0, you'll need to upgrade it.

2. Check your PHP extensions: Laravel 9 requires several PHP extensions, including `mbstring`, `curl`, `openssl`, and `pdo_mysql`. You can check which extensions are installed by running `php -m` in your terminal. If any required extensions are missing, you'll need to install them.

3. Check your Composer version: Laravel 9 requires Composer 2.0 or higher. You can check your Composer version by running `composer -V` in your terminal. If your Composer version is lower than 2.0, you'll need to upgrade it.

Once you've made any necessary updates, try running `composer create-project laravel/laravel blog "9.*"` again.
