Having separate pipelines for specific requests is not necessarily a bad practice. In fact, it can be a good practice to keep the logic for each request separate and organized.

However, it's important to consider the overall design and architecture of your application. If you find yourself creating many separate pipelines for different requests, it may be a sign that your application is becoming too complex and difficult to maintain.

In some cases, it may be possible to refactor your code to use a more generic implementation of TResponse and TRequest that can handle multiple types of requests. This can help simplify your code and make it easier to maintain in the long run.

Ultimately, the decision of whether to use separate pipelines or a more generic implementation will depend on the specific requirements and constraints of your application.
