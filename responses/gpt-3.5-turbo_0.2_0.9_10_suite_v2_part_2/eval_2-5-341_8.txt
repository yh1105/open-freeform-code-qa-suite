It's possible that the XML response is not being properly generated by the server. You can check if the server is properly configured to generate XML responses by checking the `produces` field in the OpenAPI specification. It should include `application/xml` as one of the supported media types.

If the server is properly configured, you can try adding the `produces` parameter to your `@GetMapping` annotation in your controller method to explicitly specify that the response should be in XML format:

```java
@GetMapping(value = "/pet/{petId}", produces = { "application/xml", "application/json" })
public ResponseEntity<Pet> getPetById(@PathVariable Long petId) {
    // ...
}
```

If this still doesn't work, you can try adding the `jackson-dataformat-xml` dependency to your project to ensure that the server can properly serialize objects to XML format.
