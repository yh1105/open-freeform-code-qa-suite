The error message "419 Page Expired" usually occurs when the CSRF token expires. This is a security feature in Laravel to prevent Cross-Site Request Forgery attacks. 

To avoid this error message, you can add a check in your logout function to see if the user is already logged out or not. If the user is already logged out, then you can redirect them to the login page instead of trying to log them out again.

Here is an example of how you can modify the default logout function in Laravel:

```php
public function logout(Request $request)
{
    if (Auth::check()) {
        Auth::logout();
        $request->session()->invalidate();
        $request->session()->regenerateToken();
    }
    return redirect('/login');
}
```

In this modified function, we first check if the user is already logged out using the `Auth::check()` function. If the user is already logged out, we simply redirect them to the login page. If the user is still logged in, we log them out and then redirect them to the login page.

By doing this, you can avoid the "419 Page Expired" error message and ensure that the user is always redirected to the login page after clicking the logout button.
