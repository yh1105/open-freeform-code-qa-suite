Having separate pipelines for specific requests is not necessarily a bad practice. In fact, it can be a good practice to keep the logic for each request separate and organized. 

However, if you find yourself creating many pipelines for different requests, it may be a sign that your codebase is becoming too complex and difficult to maintain. In this case, you may want to consider refactoring your code to make it more modular and reusable.

Another option to consider is using a more flexible pipeline implementation that allows you to define custom logic for each request without creating separate pipelines. For example, you could use a pipeline that takes a delegate or function to execute custom logic for each request. This would allow you to define the logic for each request in a more flexible and reusable way.
