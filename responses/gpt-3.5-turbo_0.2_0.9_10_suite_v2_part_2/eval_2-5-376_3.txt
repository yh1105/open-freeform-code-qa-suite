It seems like IntelliJ IDEA is still using the old version of Java (1.8) to compile your code. Here are some steps you can try to fix this issue:

1. Make sure you have set the correct JDK version in IntelliJ IDEA. Go to `File > Project Structure > Project Settings > Project` and select the correct JDK version (11.0.1) from the dropdown list.

2. Check the `pom.xml` file of your project (if you have one) and make sure the `maven-compiler-plugin` is configured to use Java 11. Here's an example configuration:

   ```
   <build>
       <plugins>
           <plugin>
               <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
               <artifactId>maven-compiler-plugin</artifactId>
               <version>3.8.0</version>
               <configuration>
                   <source>11</source>
                   <target>11</target>
               </configuration>
           </plugin>
       </plugins>
   </build>
   ```

3. If you are using Gradle, make sure you have set the correct Java version in your `build.gradle` file. Here's an example configuration:

   ```
   plugins {
       id 'java'
   }

   java {
       sourceCompatibility = JavaVersion.VERSION_11
       targetCompatibility = JavaVersion.VERSION_11
   }
   ```

4. If none of the above steps work, try to invalidate the cache and restart IntelliJ IDEA. Go to `File > Invalidate Caches / Restart` and select `Invalidate and Restart`.

Hope this helps!
