In order to use the `springdoc-openapi-ui` dependency, you need to make sure that you have the following configurations in your Spring Boot application:

1. Add the `@EnableSwagger2WebMvc` annotation to your main Spring Boot application class.

```java
@SpringBootApplication
@EnableSwagger2WebMvc
public class MyApplication {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(MyApplication.class, args);
    }
}
```

2. Make sure that your `pom.xml` file includes the `spring-boot-starter-web` dependency.

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-web</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

3. Check that your application is running on the correct port. By default, Spring Boot applications run on port 8080. If you have changed the port, make sure to use the correct port number when accessing the Swagger UI.

4. If you have any security configurations in your application, you may need to allow access to the Swagger UI. For example, if you are using Spring Security, you can add the following configuration to allow access to the Swagger UI:

```java
@Configuration
@EnableWebSecurity
public class SecurityConfig extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {
    @Override
    protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
        http.authorizeRequests()
            .antMatchers("/swagger-ui.html").permitAll()
            .antMatchers("/v3/api-docs/**").permitAll()
            .anyRequest().authenticated()
            .and().httpBasic();
    }
}
```

With these configurations in place, you should be able to access the Swagger UI at `http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html`.
