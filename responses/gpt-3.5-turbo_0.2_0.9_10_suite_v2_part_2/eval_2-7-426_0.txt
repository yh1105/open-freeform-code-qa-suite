The "CSRF token mismatch" error occurs when the CSRF token generated by the server does not match the one sent by the client. This can happen due to various reasons such as session expiration, incorrect token generation, or incorrect token storage.

Based on your description, it seems that the issue is related to session management on the host domain. Here are a few things you can check:

1. Verify that the session driver on the host domain is set to the same as the one on your local machine. You mentioned that you changed the SESSION_DRIVER to "file" for debugging purposes. Make sure that the session driver on the host domain is also set to "file" or the same as your local machine.

2. Check if the session cookie domain is set correctly. If the session cookie domain is not set correctly, it can cause multiple sessions to be created for the same user. Make sure that the session cookie domain is set to the correct domain name.

3. Verify that the session encryption key is set correctly. The session encryption key is used to encrypt and decrypt session data. If the encryption key is not set correctly, it can cause issues with session management. Make sure that the session encryption key on the host domain is set to the same as your local machine.

4. Check if there are any server-side caching mechanisms in place that could be interfering with session management. If there are any caching mechanisms in place, make sure that they are configured correctly to work with session management.

5. If none of the above solutions work, try clearing the session data on the host domain and regenerate the CSRF token. This can help to ensure that there are no stale session data causing issues with session management.

I hope this helps you resolve the issue.
