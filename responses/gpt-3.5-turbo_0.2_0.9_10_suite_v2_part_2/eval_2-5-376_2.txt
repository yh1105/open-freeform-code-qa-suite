It seems like IntelliJ IDEA is still using the old version of Java (1.8) to compile your code. You need to configure IntelliJ IDEA to use the new version of Java (11) that you installed.

Here's what you can try:

1. Go to `File > Project Structure > Project` and make sure that the `Project SDK` is set to `11`.
2. Go to `File > Project Structure > Modules` and make sure that the `Language level` is set to `11`.
3. Go to `File > Settings > Build, Execution, Deployment > Build Tools > Maven > Runner` and make sure that the `JRE` is set to `11`.
4. Go to `Run > Edit Configurations` and make sure that the `JRE` is set to `11`.

If none of the above steps work, you can try the following:

1. Go to `File > Project Structure > SDKs` and click on the `+` button to add a new SDK.
2. Select `JDK` and navigate to the directory where you installed Java 11 (`C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-11.0.1`).
3. Click `OK` to add the new SDK.
4. Go back to `File > Project Structure > Project` and select the newly added SDK as the `Project SDK`.
5. Go to `File > Project Structure > Modules` and select the newly added SDK as the `SDK` for each module.

If you're still having issues, you can try restarting IntelliJ IDEA or your computer to ensure that the new environment variables are being used.
