The `ext-zip` package is not a regular package that can be installed via Composer. It is actually a PHP extension that needs to be installed on your server. 

To install the `ext-zip` extension, you need to follow these steps:

1. Check if the extension is already installed by running the following command in your terminal:

   ```
   php -m | grep zip
   ```

   If the output contains `zip`, then the extension is already installed.

2. If the extension is not installed, you need to install it. The installation process varies depending on your operating system and PHP version. Here are some examples:

   - For Ubuntu, you can install the extension by running the following command:

     ```
     sudo apt-get install php-zip
     ```

   - For macOS, you can install the extension by running the following command:

     ```
     brew install php@7.4-zip
     ```

   - For Windows, you need to enable the extension in your `php.ini` file. Open the file and uncomment the following line:

     ```
     ;extension=zip
     ```

     Remove the semicolon to enable the extension.

3. Once the extension is installed, restart your web server or PHP-FPM service to apply the changes.

After installing the `ext-zip` extension, you should be able to use it in your PHP code without any issues.
