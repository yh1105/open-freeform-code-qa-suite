The error message indicates that the `ConfigServerConfigDataMissingEnvironmentPostProcessor` is trying to import configuration data from a ConfigServer, but it cannot find the `spring.config.import` property. This suggests that there may be some residual configuration from a previous version of the project that is causing this issue.

To resolve this issue, you can try the following steps:

1. Clean your project build by running `./gradlew clean` in the terminal.

2. Check if there are any configuration files in your project that reference a ConfigServer. If so, remove them or comment them out.

3. Check if there are any environment variables or system properties that reference a ConfigServer. If so, remove them or comment them out.

4. Add the following property to your `application.properties` file:

   ```
   spring.config.import=optional:configserver:
   ```

   This tells Spring to look for configuration data in a ConfigServer, but it will not fail if it cannot find one.

5. Rebuild your project and run your tests again.

If the issue persists, you can try adding the following property to your `application.properties` file instead:

```
spring.cloud.config.enabled=false
```

This will disable the ConfigServer completely, which should resolve the issue. However, this may not be desirable if you need to use a ConfigServer in your project.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
