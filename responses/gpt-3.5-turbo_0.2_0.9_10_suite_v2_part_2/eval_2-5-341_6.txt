This might be happening because the Jackson XML library is not included in your project. By default, the openapi-generator-plugin generates code that uses Jackson for JSON serialization and deserialization, but it does not include the Jackson XML library. 

To add support for XML serialization and deserialization, you need to add the Jackson XML library as a dependency in your Gradle build file. You can do this by adding the following lines to your `build.gradle` file:

```groovy
dependencies {
    // other dependencies...
    implementation 'com.fasterxml.jackson.dataformat:jackson-dataformat-xml:2.12.3'
}
```

After adding this dependency, you should be able to receive XML responses from your API.
