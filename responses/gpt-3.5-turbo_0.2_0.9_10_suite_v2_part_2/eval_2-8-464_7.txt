The error message indicates that the Lambda function is unable to find the executable file `main` in the `/var/task` directory. This is because the executable file was built on a Windows platform and is not compatible with the Linux environment that Lambda runs on.

To fix this issue, you need to build the executable file on a Linux environment or use a tool like `GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go build main.go` to build the executable file for Linux on a Windows platform.

Here are the steps to build the executable file for Linux on a Windows platform:

1. Install the Go compiler for Linux on your Windows machine. You can download it from the official Go website: https://golang.org/dl/
2. Open a command prompt and navigate to the directory where your Go code is located.
3. Set the environment variables `GOOS` and `GOARCH` to `linux` and `amd64` respectively. This will ensure that the executable file is built for the Linux environment.

```
set GOOS=linux
set GOARCH=amd64
```

4. Build the executable file using the `go build` command.

```
go build main.go
```

5. Zip the executable file and any other required files into a single archive.

6. Upload the archive to AWS Lambda and test the function again.

This should resolve the issue and allow your Lambda function to execute successfully.
