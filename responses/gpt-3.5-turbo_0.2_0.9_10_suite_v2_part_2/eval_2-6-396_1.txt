The error message is indicating that you cannot create an index on the `Gender` property of the `User` entity because it is already being used as a navigation property to the `Gender` entity. 

To solve this problem, you can create an index on the `GenderId` property instead, which is the foreign key to the `Gender` entity. 

Update your `OnModelCreating` method in your DbContext as follows:

```c#
protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder modelBuilder)
{
    modelBuilder.Entity<User>(user =>
    {
        user
        .HasOne(x => x.Gender)
        .WithMany(x => x.Users)
        .HasForeignKey(x => x.GenderId);

        user.HasIndex(x => x.GenderId);
    });
}
```

This will create an index on the `GenderId` property of the `User` entity, which is the foreign key to the `Gender` entity.
