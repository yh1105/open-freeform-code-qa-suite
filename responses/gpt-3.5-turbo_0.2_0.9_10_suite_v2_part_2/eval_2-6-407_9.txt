The error message suggests that the response from the server is not in the expected JSON format. It looks like the response starts with a '<' character, which indicates that it might be an HTML error page instead of a JSON response.

To fix this issue, you can try the following steps:

1. Check the URL of the API endpoint. Make sure it is correct and matches the route defined in the controller.

2. Test the API endpoint using a tool like Postman or curl to see if it returns the expected JSON response.

3. Check the server logs to see if there are any errors or exceptions being thrown when the API endpoint is called.

4. If the API endpoint is working correctly, try adding the `[Produces("application/json")]` attribute to the controller method to ensure that the response is always returned in JSON format.

5. If the issue persists, try using a different HTTP client library like `HttpClient` instead of `Http` to make the server call. You can also try using the `JsonSerializer.DeserializeAsync` method to deserialize the JSON response manually.

Here's an example of how you can use `HttpClient` to make the server call and deserialize the JSON response:

```c#
using System.Net.Http.Json;

// ...

private readonly HttpClient httpClient;

public FetchEmployee(HttpClient httpClient)
{
    this.httpClient = httpClient;
}

protected override async Task OnInitializedAsync()
{
    var response = await httpClient.GetAsync("/api/Employee/Index");
    var empList = await response.Content.ReadFromJsonAsync<Employee[]>();
}
```

Note that you need to register the `HttpClient` in the DI container in `Program.cs`:

```c#
builder.Services.AddScoped(sp => new HttpClient { BaseAddress = new Uri(builder.HostEnvironment.BaseAddress) });
```
