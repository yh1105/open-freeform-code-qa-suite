The error message indicates that Jackson (the JSON serializer/deserializer used by Spring) is unable to serialize the `MultipartFile` object because it contains a `ByteArrayInputStream` object, which it doesn't know how to serialize.

To solve this, you can configure Jackson to ignore the `ByteArrayInputStream` property by adding the following annotation to your `MultipartFile` class:

```java
@JsonIgnoreProperties(value = {"inputStream"})
public class MyMultipartFile implements MultipartFile {
    // ...
}
```

This will tell Jackson to ignore the `inputStream` property when serializing the `MultipartFile` object.

Alternatively, you can configure Jackson to ignore all unknown properties by adding the following property to your application.properties file:

```
spring.jackson.deserialization.fail-on-unknown-properties=false
```

This will tell Jackson to ignore any unknown properties when deserializing JSON objects.
