This error occurs because IntelliJ IDEA is using an older version of Maven than the one used by the Spring Boot project. To fix this issue, you can follow these steps:

1. Open the Maven settings in IntelliJ IDEA by going to File > Settings > Build, Execution, Deployment > Build Tools > Maven.

2. In the Maven settings, make sure that the "Maven home directory" points to the same version of Maven used by the Spring Boot project. You can check the version of Maven used by the Spring Boot project in the `pom.xml` file.

3. If the Maven home directory is correct, try clearing the IntelliJ IDEA cache and restarting the IDE. To clear the cache, go to File > Invalidate Caches / Restart.

4. If the issue still persists, try updating the Maven version used by IntelliJ IDEA to match the version used by the Spring Boot project. You can do this by going to File > Settings > Build, Execution, Deployment > Build Tools > Maven and selecting the "Use plugin registry" option. Then, search for the Maven version used by the Spring Boot project and select it.

5. Finally, try importing the Spring Boot project again and see if the issue is resolved.
