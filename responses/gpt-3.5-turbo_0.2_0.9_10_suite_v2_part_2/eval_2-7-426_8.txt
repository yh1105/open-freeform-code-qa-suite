The "CSRF token mismatch" error occurs when the CSRF token generated by the server does not match the one sent by the client. This can happen if the session is not being properly maintained on the server-side.

Here are some possible reasons why you are experiencing this issue on your hosted domain:

1. Session configuration: Check if the session configuration on your hosted domain is the same as your local environment. Make sure that the session driver, session lifetime, and session encryption key are all the same.

2. Cache configuration: If you are using a caching system like Redis or Memcached, make sure that the cache configuration is the same on your hosted domain as your local environment.

3. Load balancer: If you are using a load balancer, it is possible that requests are being sent to different servers, causing the session to be lost. In this case, you can use sticky sessions to ensure that requests are always sent to the same server.

4. HTTPS: If your hosted domain is using HTTPS, make sure that the secure flag is set on the session cookie. This ensures that the cookie is only sent over HTTPS and not over HTTP.

5. Server configuration: Check if the server configuration on your hosted domain is the same as your local environment. Make sure that the PHP version, extensions, and settings are all the same.

I hope this helps you identify the issue and resolve the "CSRF token mismatch" error on your hosted domain.
