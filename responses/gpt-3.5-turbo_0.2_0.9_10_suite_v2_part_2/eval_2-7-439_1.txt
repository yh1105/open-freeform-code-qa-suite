The `ext-zip` package is not a regular package that can be installed via Composer. It is actually a PHP extension that needs to be installed on your server. 

To install the `ext-zip` extension, you need to follow these steps:

1. Check if the `zip` extension is already installed on your server by running the following command in your terminal:

   ```
   php -m | grep zip
   ```

   If the `zip` extension is already installed, you should see `zip` in the output. If it's not installed, you can proceed to the next step.

2. Install the `zip` extension using the package manager for your operating system. For example, on Ubuntu, you can run the following command:

   ```
   sudo apt-get install php-zip
   ```

   On CentOS, you can run:

   ```
   sudo yum install php-zip
   ```

   If you're using a different operating system, you'll need to consult its documentation to find out how to install the `zip` extension.

3. Once the `zip` extension is installed, restart your web server to apply the changes.

   On Ubuntu, you can run:

   ```
   sudo service apache2 restart
   ```

   On CentOS, you can run:

   ```
   sudo service httpd restart
   ```

After completing these steps, you should be able to use the `zip` extension in your PHP code.
