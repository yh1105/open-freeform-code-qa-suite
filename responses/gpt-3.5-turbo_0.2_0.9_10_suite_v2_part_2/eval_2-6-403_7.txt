You can use the `JsonResult` class to return JSON with a HTTP status code in your .NET Core Web API controller. Here's an example:

```c#
public JsonResult IsAuthenticated()
{
    return new JsonResult("123")
    {
        StatusCode = 200
    };
}
```

In this example, we're creating a new `JsonResult` object and passing in the JSON data as a parameter. We're also setting the `StatusCode` property to `200` to indicate a successful response.

You can also use the `Ok` method to return a JSON result with a HTTP status code:

```c#
public IActionResult IsAuthenticated()
{
    return Ok("123");
}
```

This will return a JSON result with a HTTP status code of `200`. You can also specify a different status code by using the `StatusCode` method:

```c#
public IActionResult IsAuthenticated()
{
    return StatusCode(201, "123");
}
```

This will return a JSON result with a HTTP status code of `201`.
