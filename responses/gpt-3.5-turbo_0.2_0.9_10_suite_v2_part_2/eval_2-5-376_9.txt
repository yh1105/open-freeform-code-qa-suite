It seems like IntelliJ IDEA is still using the old JDK version (1.8) to compile your code. You need to configure IntelliJ IDEA to use the new JDK version (11.0.1) instead.

Here's how you can do it:

1. Go to `File > Project Structure`.
2. Under `Project Settings`, select `Project`.
3. In the `Project SDK` dropdown, select `11.0.1`.
4. Click `OK`.

This should configure IntelliJ IDEA to use the new JDK version for your project.
