The error message "419 Page Expired" usually occurs when the CSRF token expires. This can happen when the user stays on the same page for too long, or when they have multiple tabs open with the same session.

To avoid this error message, you can add a check in your logout function to see if the user is still authenticated. If they are not, then you can redirect them to the login page instead of trying to log them out.

Here's an example of how you can modify the default Laravel logout function to handle this scenario:

```
public function logout(Request $request)
{
    if (Auth::check()) {
        Auth::logout();
        $request->session()->invalidate();
        $request->session()->regenerateToken();
    }
    
    return redirect('/login');
}
```

This code checks if the user is still authenticated before logging them out. If they are not authenticated, it simply redirects them to the login page. This way, you can avoid the "419 Page Expired" error message and provide a better user experience.
