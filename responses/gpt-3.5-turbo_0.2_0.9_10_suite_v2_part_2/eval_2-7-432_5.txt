The error "419 Page Expired" usually occurs when the CSRF token expires. This token is used to protect against cross-site request forgery attacks. 

To avoid this error, you can try the following solutions:

1. Increase the session lifetime: You can increase the session lifetime in the `config/session.php` file. By default, the session lifetime is set to 120 minutes. You can increase it to a longer time period to avoid the token from expiring too soon.

2. Use AJAX to logout: Instead of using a regular form to logout, you can use AJAX to send a request to the server to logout. This way, the CSRF token will be refreshed automatically and you won't get the "419 Page Expired" error.

3. Use a package: You can use a package like laravel-csrf to handle CSRF tokens automatically. This package will automatically refresh the CSRF token when it expires, so you won't have to worry about it.

I hope this helps!
