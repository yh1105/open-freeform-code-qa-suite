For the first question, the "CSRF token mismatch" error could be caused by a few things. One possibility is that the server's clock is not synchronized with the client's clock, causing the token to expire before it should. Another possibility is that the session is not being properly maintained on the server, causing the token to be lost or regenerated. You can try increasing the SESSION_LIFETIME to see if it resolves the issue. Additionally, you can check if the server has any security measures in place that could be interfering with the session, such as a firewall or security plugin.

For the second question, the error message suggests that the SSL version being used by the server is not compatible with the SSL version being used by the client. You can try changing the encryption method to 'tls' instead of 'ssl' in your .env file and mail.php configuration file. Additionally, you can try changing the port to 465 instead of 587. If these changes do not work, you may need to contact the email provider to ensure that the correct SSL version and encryption method are being used.
