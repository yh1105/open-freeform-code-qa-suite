The error message "419 Page Expired" is related to CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection in Laravel. When you log out from one tab, the CSRF token associated with the session is invalidated. When you try to log out from the other tab, the CSRF token is no longer valid, and you get the "419 Page Expired" error.

To avoid this error, you can add a check in your logout function to see if the CSRF token is valid. If it is not valid, you can regenerate the token and then log out the user. Here's an example code snippet:

```
public function logout(Request $request)
{
    if (!$request->session()->regenerateToken()) {
        // Handle token regeneration failure
    }

    Auth::logout();

    return redirect('/');
}
```

This code regenerates the CSRF token using the `regenerateToken` method of the session. If the token regeneration fails, you can handle the error as appropriate for your application. Then, you can log out the user using the `logout` method of the `Auth` facade. Finally, you can redirect the user to the home page or any other page as appropriate for your application.
