By default, Laravel's `dd()` function has a depth limit of 3 levels. This means that if you have nested relationships beyond 3 levels, you won't be able to see all the data.

To increase the depth limit, you can pass a second argument to the `dd()` function. For example, if you want to increase the depth limit to 5 levels, you can do:

```php
dd($data, 5);
```

This will show you the data up to 5 levels deep.

Alternatively, you can use the `dump()` function instead of `dd()`. The `dump()` function will output the data without stopping the script execution, so you can see all the data without any depth limit. However, this can be overwhelming if you have a lot of data.

```php
dump($data);
```

I hope this helps!
