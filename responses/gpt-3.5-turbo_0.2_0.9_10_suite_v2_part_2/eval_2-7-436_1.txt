The error message suggests that your current PHP version and extensions are not compatible with Laravel 9. 

Laravel 9 requires PHP 8.0 or higher, and some extensions such as OpenSSL, PDO, Mbstring, Tokenizer, and XML. 

You can check your PHP version by running `php -v` in your terminal. To install the required extensions, you can use your package manager or install them manually. 

Once you have the correct PHP version and extensions installed, try running the `composer create-project` command again.
