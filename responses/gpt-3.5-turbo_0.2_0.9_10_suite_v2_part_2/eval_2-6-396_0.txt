The error message is telling you that you cannot create an index on a navigation property, which is what `Gender` is in the `User` entity. To fix this, you need to specify which property of the `Gender` entity you want to create an index on. 

In your case, you probably want to create an index on the `GenderId` property of the `User` entity, which is the foreign key to the `Gender` entity. To do this, change your `OnModelCreating` method to the following:

```c#
protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder modelBuilder)
{
    modelBuilder.Entity<User>(user =>
    {
        user
        .HasOne(x => x.Gender)
        .WithMany(x => x.Users)
        .HasForeignKey(x => x.GenderId);

        user.HasIndex(x => x.GenderId);
    });
}
```

This will create an index on the `GenderId` property of the `User` entity, which is what you want.
