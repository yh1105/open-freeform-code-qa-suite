When I run
```
bin/console doctrine:migrations:list
```
I see the Migration listed as:
```
Application\Migrations\Version20210909072642
```
I am attempting to rollback a migration and I have tried a few different versions:
```
bin/console --env=dev doctrine:migrations:execute 'Application\DoctrineMigrations\Version20210909072642' --down --no-interaction -vvv
bin/console --env=dev doctrine:migrations:execute Version20210909072642 --down --no-interaction -vvv
bin/console --env=dev doctrine:migrations:execute 20210909072642 --down --no-interaction -vvv
```

Every time I run it I get the following error:
```
In MigrationClassNotFound.php line 15:

  [Doctrine\Migrations\Exception\MigrationClassNotFound]
  Migration class "20210909072642" was not found?
```

My Doctrine config looks like this:
```
doctrine_migrations:
    migrations_paths:
        'Application\Migrations': 'app/DoctrineMigrations'
    storage:
        table_storage:
            table_name: 'migration_versions'
```

What command should I use to solve the problem?
