hi im working with dataset in pandas. lets say the dataset having ID, TEST_TYPE, TEST_STATUS, TEST_DATE, etc

i need to group a kind of column so first i try
```python
data_useless[['TEST_TYPE', 'TEST_STATUS']].groupby('TEST_STATUS').count_values()
```
and it worked : showing the result of grouped data by test_status(FAILED TEST and PASS TEST) and count value of that data on dataset

now i want to know and see the data more from the PASS TEST

so i tried
```python
data_useless.groupby(['TEST_STATUS'] == 'PASS TEST')
```
and it not working.. showing error, it say KEY ERROR : FALSE

i need to do something like in sql :
```sql
SELECT *
FROM data_useless
WHERE TEST_STATUS = "PASS TEST"
group by TEST_STATUS;
```
Please tell me how to write the python codes.
