I've configured my console application's Main like so
```c#
var services = new ServiceCollection()
    .AddLogging(logging => logging.AddConsole())
    .BuildServiceProvider();
```
And then I try to use it in another class like so
```c#
private readonly ILogger _logger;

public MyClass(ILogger logger)
{
    _logger = logger;
}

public void MyFunc()
{
    _logger.Log(LogLevel.Error, "My Message");
}
```
However, I'm getting the following exception:
```c#
System.InvalidOperationException: 'Unable to resolve service for type 'Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.ILogger'
```

How to solve this problem?
