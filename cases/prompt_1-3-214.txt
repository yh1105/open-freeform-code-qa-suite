I'm trying to run a Profile Report for EDA in conda Jupyter NB, but keep getting errors.
Here is my code thus far:

```python
    import pandas_profiling
    from pandas_profiling import ProfileReport

    profile = ProfileReport(data)
```

and

```python
    profile = pandas_profiling.ProfileReport(data)
```

both of which produce:

```bash
TypeError: concat() got an unexpected keyword argument 'join_axes'
```

Research recommended upgrading to Pandas 1.0, which I'm using.

Also tried

```python
    data.profile_report()
```

and I get

```bash
AttributeError: 'DataFrame' object has no attribute 'profile_report'
```

Any tips on where I am going wrong?

How to solve this problem?
