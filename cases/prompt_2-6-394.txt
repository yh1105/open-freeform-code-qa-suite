I want to inject this interface to my controllers:
```c#
public interface IDatabaseService<T>
{
    IEnumerable<T> GetList();
    ...
}
```
But this is a generic interface. When I try to ineject in my Startup.cs, I'll have to pass a generic type like this (which is not feasible):
```c#
services.AddScoped<IDatabaseService<T>>();
```
So what is the correct C# code to inject a generic interface?
