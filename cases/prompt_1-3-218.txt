How to remove special characters from rows in pandas dataframe

I have a column in pandas data frame like the one shown below;

```
LGA

Alpine (S)
Ararat (RC)
Ballarat (C)
Banyule (C)
Bass Coast (S)
Baw Baw (S)
Bayside (C)
Benalla (RC)
Boroondara (C)
```

What I want to do, is to remove all the special characters from the ending of each row. ie. (S), (RC).

Desired output should be;

```
LGA

Alpine
Ararat
Ballarat
Banyule
Bass Coast
Baw Baw
Bayside
Benalla
Boroondara
```

I am not quite sure how to get desired output mentioned above.

Please write a function `remove` in Python, which takes DataFrame variable `df` as the argument, which is defined as above (the column name is "LGA"), and returns `df` according to my requirement.

Function signature is: `remove(df)`
