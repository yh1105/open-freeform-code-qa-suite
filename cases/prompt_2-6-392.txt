I'm facing an issue where the generic implementation of TResponse and TRequest is not enough. For example, I need
```c#
PipelineBehavior<RequestOne, ResponseOne>
```
to do a specific logic for the requestOne, and another
```c#
PipelineBehavior<RequestTwo, ResponseTwo>
```
to do another logic that doesn't apply to request one.
I wonder if having two separate pipelines for two very specific request is a bad practice.
