I am completely new to `openpyxl` so, as you can imagine, I am having pretty hard times when I try to make use of it.

I have an Excel report that contains only one sheet (called `Sheet1`). I'd like to search all cells for those that contain specific string (product name `ABC` in this case).

Then I would like to copy contents of every cell in the rows that contain cell with ABC product name. And assign every cell to a variable.

Please write a function `filterExcelRows` in python, which takes `filePath` and `matchedString` as arguments and returns the indexes of the rows that contain `matchedString` in `List`.

Function signature is: `filterExcelRows(filePath, matchedString)`
