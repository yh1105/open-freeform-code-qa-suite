I want to get started with Hyperledger Besu, after following the steps of the official documentation here and running the following command:
```shell
bin\besu --help
```

I get the following error:
```
C:\Users\user\Desktop\besu-1.3.9>bin\besu --help
Unrecognized option: --add-opens
Error: Could not create the Java Virtual Machine.
Error: A fatal exception has occurred. Program will exit.
I get the same thing when running bin\besu or bin\besu -help.
```

I don't know if the problem is with java's installation or with hyperledger besu trying to run unvalid/unrecognised option bin\besu --add-opens. I tried uninstalling then reinstalling java but this did not solve the issue, here is java's version:
```
C:\Users\user>java -version
Picked up _JAVA_OPTIONS: -Xmx512m
java version "1.8.0_241"
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_241-b07)
Java HotSpot(TM) Client VM (build 25.241-b07, mixed mode)
Any help would be appreciated!
