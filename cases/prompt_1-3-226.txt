I have a string like below in python

```
testing_abc
```

I want to split string based on _ and extract the second element

I have done like below

```python
split_string = string.split('_')[1]
```

I am getting the correct output as expected

```
abc
```

Now I want this to work for below strings

```
xyz
```

When I use

```python
split_string = string.split('_')[1]
```

I get below error

```
list index out of range
```

expected output I want is xyz

For the below string

```
testing_abc_bbc
```

When I use

```python
split_string = string.split('_')[1]
```

I get `abc` as output

expected output I want is `abc_bbc`

Basically What I want is

1) If string contains `_` then print everything after the first `_` as variable
2) If string doesn't contain `_` then print the string as variable

Please write a function `splitOne` with a string `s` as the argument and returns the string I need.

The signature of the function is `splitOne(s)`
