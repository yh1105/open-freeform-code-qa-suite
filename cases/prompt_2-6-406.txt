I try to create a .NET 6 Console Application but having troubles reading my appsettings.json file. In a web application I could use this:
```c#
var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);
```
But what would I use in a console application? I get this error when trying to add it to program.cs.
```
"The name 'WebApplication' does not exist in the current context"
```
How to solve this?
