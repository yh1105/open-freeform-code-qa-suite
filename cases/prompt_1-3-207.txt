I am working on a simple code able to evaluate the end time of a period of time, given as a number of minutes (it could be arbitrarily large). The start time is given as a pair of hours (0..23) and minutes (0..59). The result has to be printed to the console.

For example, if an event starts at 12:17 and lasts 59 minutes, it will end at 13:16.

So far I tried below code and finding difficult to get hours calculation please help.

```python
hour = int(input("Starting time (hours): "))
mins = int(input("Starting time (minutes): "))
dura = int(input("Event duration (minutes): "))
mins = (mins + dura)%60
hour = **** Please help this calculation ****
print(hour, ":", mins, sep='')
#expected output is 13:16 (ex: given hour = 12 , mins = 17 , dura = 59 )
```

Please write a function `computeEndTime` in Python, which takes three arguments: `hour`, `mins`, `dura`, and returns the end time in string with the format "xx:xx".

Function signature is: `computeEndTime(hour, mins, dura)`
