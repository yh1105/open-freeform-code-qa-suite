My Goal

I have a specific set of a long list containing many asset pairs with different endings: `BTCUSDT` `ETHBTC` `ANKRETH`... From this list, I would like to filter out the symbols ending with USDT.

Here are my attempts:

```python
my_set = ['LUNAUSDT', 'ETHBTC', 'ETHBNB', 'BTCUSDT', 'MANATUSD', 'ALICEETH' ]
my_set = [word for word in symbols if 'USDT' in my_set]
my_set
```

But this results in an empty set.
