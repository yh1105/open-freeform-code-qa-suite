I know its possible to print RGB colored text like so:

```python
def colored(r, g, b, text):
    return "\033[38;2;{};{};{}m{} \033[39m".format(r, g, b, text)


text = "Hello, World"
colored_text = colored(132, 204, 247, text)
print(colored_text)
```

But, is there a way to print with RGB colored background?

Cuz, as far as I know, there are a few kinda built-in background colors for printing. But I want to be able to use rgb codes and get the appropriate background color for the printed text.

Please modify the above function to achieve my requirements.
The function signature is `def colored(background_r, background_g, background_b, text):`
You need only output the function without any extra comments.
