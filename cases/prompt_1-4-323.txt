I have a `data.frame` with 150 column names. For each column, I want to extract the maximum and minimum values (the rows repeat) and the row names of each maximum value. I have extracted the min and max values in another data.frame but don't know how to match them.

I have found functions that are very close for this, like for minimum values:

```r
head(cars)
speed dist
1     4    2
2     4   10
3     7    4
4     7   22
5     8   16
6     9   10

sapply(cars,which.min)

speed  dist
1     1
```

Here, it only gives the first index for minimum speed.

And I've tried with loops like:

```r
for (i in (colnames(cars))){
print(min(cars[[i]]))
}


[1] 4
[1] 2
```

But that just gives me the minimum values, and not if they are repeated and the rowname of each repeated value.

I want something like:

```
min.value  column  rowname   freq.times
4          speed      1,2        2
2          dist       1          1
```

Please write a function `myMaxMin` in R, which takes `cars` as the argument, which are shown above, and returns the table according to my above requirements.

Function signature is: `myMaxMin <- function(cars)`
