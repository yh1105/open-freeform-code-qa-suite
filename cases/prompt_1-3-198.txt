I searched similar questions about reading csv from URL but I could not find a way to read csv file from google drive csv file.

My attempt:

```python
import pandas as pd

url = 'https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B6GhBwm5vaB2ekdlZW5WZnppb28/view?usp=sharing'
dfs = pd.read_html(url)
```

How can we read this file in pandas?

Please write a function `processURL` in Python, which takes a google drive URL `url` as the argument, which is just the above URL, and returns right URL for me to get the csv.

Function signature is: `processURL(url)`
